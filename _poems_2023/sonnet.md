pid: sonnet
title: Soneto
transtitle: Sonnet
author: Guillermo Blest Gana
translator: Madison Weiss
poem: |-
  Si a veces silencioso y pensativo
  a tu lado me ves, querida mía,
  es porque hallo en tus ojos la armonía
  de un lenguaje tan dulce y expresivo.
  Y eres tan mía entonces, que me privo
  hasta oír tu voz, porque creería
  que rompiendo el silencio, desunía
  mi ser del tuyo, cuando en tu alma vivo.
  ¡Y estás tan bella; mi placer es tanto,
  es tan completo cuando así te miro;
  siento en mi corazón tan dulce encanto,
  que me parece, a veces, que en ti admiro
  una visión celeste, un sueño santo
  que va a desvanecerse si respiro!
transpoem: |-
  If at times, thoughtful and silent
  by your side you do see me,
  it is because I discover in your eyes the harmony
  of a most tender and affectionate language.
  And you are so much mine, then, that I myself deprive
  of even hearing your voice, because I fear
  that in breaking the silence, my dear,
  I split my being from yours, when in your soul I live.
  And you are so beautiful, my pleasure is so great,
  so complete when I look at you like this;
  I feel in my heart such sweet enchantment,
  that it seems, at times, as if in you I admire
  a heavenly vision, a holy dream
  that will vanish if I so much as breathe!
note: "<p>The biggest challenge that I faced when translating this poem was deciding
  how to balance faithfulness to the structure versus the word choice. As a petrarchan
  sonnet, the original poem has a very exacting form in terms of rhyme scheme and
  meter; I did my best to preserve these elements while still being true to the language
  that the poet uses. I unfortunately found myself largely forced to abandon the technical
  elements of the poem in the name of creating something that sounded beautiful, not
  formulaic, in English. The language that Blest Gana uses is so subtly evocative,
  and English rhyme is so limited, that it was truly difficult to create a translation
  that could really be considered a translation and not a re-imagining or rewriting.
  For me, trying to translate “Soneto” was an exercise of putting myself into the
  poet’s head to decide how far I could stretch his work in any given direction without
  losing sight of it as a whole, missing the forest for the trees.</p>"
abio: "<p>Guillermo Blest Gana was a Chilean writer born in 1829. Originally a law
  student, he fell ill and decided to pursue writing instead, publishing two works
  of lyrical poetry during his lifetime: <em>Poesías</em>, his first ever publication,
  which was inspired by the pain of losing his sister and the love he felt for his
  brothers, and, thirty years later, <em>Armonías</em>. During this time, his poetry
  shifted from romanticism, a style of which he is considered an exemplary author
  in Chile, to classicism. Between the release of these works, he was exiled from
  Chile as a political dissident, but he later returned. He continued writing in Santiago
  until his death in 1904, at which point his friend Antonio Orrego Barros assembled,
  edited, and published three volumes comprising his life’s work.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Madison Weiss is a senior at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in
  Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, minoring in French and Spanish. They hold a
  deep appreciation for classic literature, deep conversation, and pairing either
  with a good cup of coffee.</p>"
