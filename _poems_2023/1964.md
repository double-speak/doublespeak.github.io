transtitle: '1964'
author: Jorge Luis Borges
translator: Samantha DeStefano
poem: "I \n\nYa no es mágico el mundo. Te han dejado. \nYa no compartirás la clara
  luna\nNi los lentos jardines. Ya no hay una\nLuna que no sea espejo del pasado,
  \nCristal de soledad, sol de agonías. \nAdiós las mutuas manos y las sienes \nQue
  acercaba el amor. Hoy sólo tienes \nLa fiel memoria y los desiertos días. \nNadie
  pierde (repites vanamente)\nSino lo que no tiene y no ha tenido \nNunca, pero no
  basta ser valiente\nPara aprender el arte del olvido.\nUn símbolo, una rosa, te
  desgarra\nY te puede matar una guitarra. \n\nII \n\nYa no seré feliz. Tal vez no
  importa. \nHay tantas otras cosas en el mundo; \nUn instante cualquiera es más profundo
  \nY diverso que el mar. La vida es corta \nY aunque las horas son tan largas, una
  \nOscura maravilla nos acecha,\nLa muerte, ese otro mar, esa otra flecha \nQue nos
  libra del sol y de la luna\nY del amor. La dicha que me diste\nY me quitaste debe
  ser borrada;\nLo que era todo tiene que ser nada.\nSólo que me queda el goce de
  estar triste, \nEsa vana costumbre que me inclina\nAl Sur, a cierta puerta, a cierta
  esquina."
transpoem: "I \n\nThe world’s no longer magic. They have left you. \nYou will no longer
  share the clear bright moon \nNor the slow gardens. Now there is no longer \nA moon
  that’s not a mirror of the past, \nCrystal of solitude, sun of agonies.\nGoodbye
  to mutual hands and to our temples\nThat love brought near. Today you only have\nThe
  loyal memory and the deserted days. \nOne only loses (you repeat in vain)\nWhat
  one does not have and has never had \nBut being brave is not enough to learn\nThe
  art of forgetting: oblivion.\nA symbol or a rose tears up your heart \nWhat’s more,
  you can be killed by a guitar. \n\nII \n\nI won’t be happy now. Perhaps it doesn’t
  matter. \nSo many other things are in the world;\nA random instant is far more profound\nAnd
  varied than the sea. Yes, life is short \nAnd though the hours are so long, a dark
  \nWonder lies in ambush, stalking us,\nDeath, that other sea, that other arrow\nThat
  frees us from the sun and from the moon\nAnd love as well. The happiness you gave
  me\nAnd took away from me must be erased.\nWhat once was everything now must be
  nothing.\nOnly that I still enjoy being sad, \nThat vain habit that makes me inclined
  to \nThe South, a certain door, a certain corner."

  <p>I translated Jorge Luis Borges’ double sonnet into blank verse to preserve the poem’s original rhythm and to avoid distorting its syntax or meaning to fit the confines of sonnets’ strict rhyme schemes. I translated lines literally wherever possible and usually chose words whose pattern of stressed syllables and number of total syllables best fit iambic pentameter. I also used rhythm to create emphasis, especially when I added “yes” before “life is short” (la vida es corta) to keep the meter.</p>
  <p>I used some secondary meanings to keep the rhythm, such as when I translated <em>diverso</em> as “varied” rather than “diverse.” I sometimes included both meanings of a word to fit the meter and to enrich the images. <em>Clara</em> means “clear; bright,” so I rendered "clara luna" as “clear bright moon.” <em>Acechar means</em> “to lie in ambush; to stalk,” so I translated "nos acecha" as “lies in ambush, stalking us” to vividly depict how death seems distant yet inexorably sneaks up on people.</p>
  <p>I translated other phrases more freely, such as "un instante cualquiera," where I used its implied meaning of “a random instant” instead of the literal “any instant.” While “y te puede matar una guitarra” means “and a guitar can kill you,” I rendered it as “what’s more, you can be killed by a guitar” to add the number of syllables required for iambic pentameter. Ending the line with “guitar” also creates a slant rhyme with “heart” at the end of the previous line. As in the original, the first sonnet now concludes with an emphasis on its subject, the reminiscing lover’s pained susceptibility to beauty, instead of “oblivion,” the subject of the second sonnet.</p>
  <p>"No basta ser valiente / Para aprender el arte del olvido" means “But being brave is not enough / To learn the art of forgetting.” I changed the enjambment and idiomatically translated "el arte del olvido" (“the art of forgetting”), then added <em>olvido</em>’s literal meaning (“oblivion”). Instead of having two too-short lines, I created one in perfect iambic pentameter followed by one with near-perfect meter. However, I translated the poem’s penultimate line literally, sacrificing rhythm for meaning to avoid making the syntax awkward.</p>
abio: "<p>Jorge Luis Borges (1899 – 1986) was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where
  he grew up bilingual in English and Spanish and read widely in European literature.
  As an adolescent, he spent seven years with his family in Europe, where he learned
  French, German, and Latin. When they returned to Buenos Aires in 1921, he began
  his literary career as a poet and translator of poetry. For most of his life, he
  was known mainly in Latin America for his poetry. He developed an international
  reputation as a fiction writ- er after receiving the Prix Formentor International
  Publishers Prize in 1961, which spurred the translation of his best-known short
  story and essay collections, <em>Ficciones</em> (<em>Fictions</em>, 1944) and <em>Labyrinths</em>
  (1962), into English and other languages. His blend of genres and use of metafiction
  in his fantastical postmodern stories about the nature of time and reality strongly
  influenced the development of magic realism. His writings and sudden fame also helped
  catalyze the Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s, in which the books of young
  experimental and political novelists such as Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez,
  Carlos Fuentes, and Mario Vargas Llosa began to reach a global audience. Borges
  died in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Samantha DeStefano graduated summa cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania
  with a bachelor’s in English, a concentration in medieval and Renaissance literature,
  and minors in both Classical studies and Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies.
  At Penn, she studied Latin, Old English, and Middle English. She has published academic
  research in <em>Transcription Collection</em> and <em>Journal of the Penn Manuscript
  Collective</em> on a manuscript of <em>Poems, 1805 —1818</em> by John Syng Dorsey,
  the author of the first American textbook of surgery, for which she translated quotations
  from Latin poetry. She published translations of David Diop’s French poems “To My
  Mother” and “He Who Lost Everything” in the Spring 2020 issue of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>,
  of “To a Black Dancer” in the Spring 2021 issue, and of “The Vultures” in the Spring
  2022 issue. She has near-native knowledge of Spanish and is fluent in French.</p>"
