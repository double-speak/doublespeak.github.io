pid: erlkonigs-tochter
title: Erlkönigs Tochter
transtitle: Elm-King's Daughter
author: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
translator: Benjamin McAvoy-Bickford
poem: Herr Oluf reitet spät und weit, Zu bieten auf seine Hochzeitsleut; Da tanzen
  die Elfen auf grünem Land, Erlkönigs Tochter reicht ihm die Hand. »Willkommen, Herr
  Oluf! Was eilst von hier? Tritt her in den Reihen und tanz mit mir.« »Ich darf nicht
  tanzen, nicht tanzen ich mag, Frühmorgen ist mein Hochzeittag.« »Hör an, Herr Oluf,
  tritt tanzen mit mir, Zwei güldne Sporne schenk ich dir. Ein Hemd von Seide so weiß
  und fein, Meine Mutter bleicht’s mit Mondenschein.« »Ich darf nicht tanzen, nicht
  tanzen ich mag, Frühmorgen ist mein Hochzeitstag.« »Hör an, Herr Oluf, tritt tanzen
  mit mir, Einen Haufen Goldes schenk ich dir.« »Einen Haufen Goldes nähm ich wohl;
  Doch tanzen ich nicht darf noch soll.« »Und willt, Herr Oluf, nicht tanzen mit mir,
  Soll Seuch und Krankheit folgen dir.« Sie tät einen Schlag ihm auf sein Herz, Noch
  nimmer fühlt er solchen Schmerz. Sie hob ihn bleichend auf sein Pferd. »Reit heim
  nun zu deinem Fräulein wert.« Und als er kam vor Hauses Tür, Seine Mutter zitternd
  stand dafür. »Hör an, mein Sohn, sag an mir gleich, Wie ist dein’ Farbe blaß und
  bleich?« »Und sollt sie nicht sein blaß und bleich, Ich traf in Erlenkönigs Reich.«
  »Hör an, mein Sohn, so lieb und traut, Was soll ich nun sagen deiner Braut?« »Sagt
  ihr, ich sei im Wald zur Stund, Zu proben da mein Pferd und Hund.« Frühmorgen und
  als es Tag kaum war, Da kam die Braut mit der Hochzeitschar. »Sie schenkten Met,
  sie schenkten Wein; Wo ist Herr Oluf, der Bräutigam mein?« »Herr Oluf, er ritt in
  Wald zur Stund, Er probt allda sein Pferd und Hund.« Die Braut hob auf den Scharlach
  rot, Da lag Herr Oluf, und er war tot.
transpoem: '"Sir Oluf rides both far and wide, To tell them of his marriage-bride;
  There dance the elves on verdant land, The Elm-King’s daughter gave her hand. “Come
  in, Sir Oluf! Must you flee? Do stay to waltz and dance with me.” “I must not dance,
  no dance I may, Tomorrow morn’s my wedding day.” “Sir Oluf, listen, dance with me,
  Two golden spurs I’ll give to thee. A silken shirt so fine and white, My mother
  bleached it with moonlight.” “I must not dance, no dance I may, Tomorrow morn’s
  my wedding day.” “Sir Oluf, listen, dance with me, A golden hoard I’ll give to thee.”
  “I’d take a golden hoard, it’s true; Yet I must never dance with you.” “You won’t,
  Sir Oluf, dance with me, Let pox and illness follow thee.” She dealt a blow unto
  his heart, He felt a wound to deeply smart. She helped him, pale, onto his horse.
  “For your one, ride a homeward course.” And as he reached his house’s door, His
  mother, trembling, stood before. “My son, do listen, tell me true, What makes your
  face so pale and blue?” “And should it not be pale and blue, The Elm-King’s realm
  I did go through.” “My son, do listen, my dear pride, What should I now go tell
  your bride?” “Just say I went into the grove To let my horse and dog go rove.” The
  day, by early morning, rose, The bride came by in wedding clothes. “They give the
  mead, they give the wine, Oh where’s Sir Oluf, bridegroom mine?” “Sir Oluf’s gone
  into the grove, To let his horse and dog go rove.” The bride was turning scarlet
  red, There lay Sir Oluf, he was dead. "'
note: "<p>“Der Erlkönig” has become one of Goethe’s most famous poems because it lends
  itself well to musical settings, of which one by Franz Schubert has become the most
  well-known. However, its long history of musical settings stretches from the first
  setting, by the actress, musician, and singer Corona Schröter, to Carl Loewe’s popular
  version, to more recent works such as Marc-André Hamelin’s “Étude No. 8 in B-Flat
  Minor”, “Erlkönig, after Goethe”. “Earl King” by the Carolina Chocolate Drops also
  deserves note as a recent, and quite good, musical reworking of this scene. Some
  of the reasons that this poem calls out to musicians is in its strong sense of rhyme
  and a continual forward movement of the action, which I attempted to imitate in
  my English rendering by setting it to one of the meters typical of a ballad.</p> \n
  \        \n<p>Furthermore, this suits the history of the poem; Goethe was inspired
  by the Danish ballad “Elveskud”, also called “Elverskud” and an interpretation of
  the ballad by Johann Gottfried Herder, the second poem translated here. The title
  of  “Erlkönigs Tochter”, or “Elm-King’s Daughter”, seems more common to me than
  the alternate title of “Herr Oluf.” The Herder poem has a similar musicality, since
  it was only lightly adapted from the original source material in the process of
  translation. I chose to render it in a different meter common among ballads and
  hymns that better suited the rhythm of its lines.</p> \n        <p>However, Herder’s
  translation differs significantly from the source text in one way: It discusses
  the “Erlkönig”, or alder-king, instead of the elf-king found in the earlier Danish
  ballad. Although a common approach in English is to simply render “Erlkönig” as
  erl-king, I found this unsatisfying because it destroys the history and meaning
  of the original. Three things, to me, are important about the “Erl” in “Erlkönig”:
  The way it sounds, its meaning of referring to an alder, and how it was supposed
  to initially refer to elves. I found that a translation of elm-king preserved the
  sound symbolism, connected it with trees, and resembled the word elf-king.</p> \n
  \        \n<p>I also sought to preserve the different but interlinked feels of the
  two poems. Goethe’s version takes its time elucidating every line, but the poem
  progresses quickly and straightforwardly to the inevitable end. The lines of Herder
  do not force the reader to slow down as much, but instead the poem circles back
  again and again with its chorus. Ultimately, I decided to balance the need to preserve
  that character with the limits of a literal translation. The translation that I
  settled on isn’t wholly literal but tries to be literal when possible and strictly
  abides by line divisions. I also left some archaisms that seemed to want to sneak
  into the Herder poem stand, which helped preserve its folk-esque origins while giving
  me additional freedom to stick to my self-imposed metrical scheme.</p>"
abio: "<p>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749 – 1832) is arguably the most famous author
  to ever make use of the German language. Besides his poetry, he served as an adviser
  in the Weimar Court and wrote numerous novels, plays, scientific works, and articles.
  Although he can’t neatly be grouped into any one literary movement, he was influenced
  by the Sturm und Drang movement early on in his career and was a major influence
  on burgeoning German Romanticism. Goethe also studied the Quran and Islamic literature
  more generally, an influence demonstrated in his “West-östlicher Divan.” Goethe’s
  esteem in Germanic literary culture is so high that the government-supported foundation
  for the German language abroad is called the Goethe-Institut.\n</p>        \n\n<p>Johann
  Gottfried von Herder (1744 –1803) was a friend of Goethe, although their relationship
  did not last. He became a notable poet and critic in his own right, and was also
  supported by the work of the Weimar Court. Similarly to Goethe, his work is influenced
  by both the neoclassical style of Weimar and the Sturm und Drang movement. His views
  helped give rise to later German nationalistic movements, although he was also a
  supporter of the French Revolution and generally expressed complex and sometimes
  confusing views on political matters.</p>"
