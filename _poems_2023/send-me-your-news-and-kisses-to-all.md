poem: "Mi chiedo cos’hai visto\nquando non hai visto più niente\nquando per qualche
  secondo\nti hanno spento la luce degli occhi.\nFissavi un punto impossibile del
  soffitto\ne ti ho sentita andare via, camminare\nsul muro, stringere la mano a un
  altro bene.\nPoi sei tornata e non te n’eri accorta,\nhai chiesto: sono a terra?
  e hai guardato me.\nSì, eri a terra, eri la mia terra\nche tremava sotto ai piedi.\n
  \                                                       \nE allora rispondi bene\na
  chi ti chiede come stai\ne non vede l’inferno che ti scuote\nnon ti vede andare
  via di spalle.\nCol tempo diventa tutto normale\ntu dici che l’universo conosce\nla
  strada più di te e che capita\na tanti e che c’è di peggio\nc’è sempre di peggio.\nMa
  una parte di pianto resta\ngonfia in mezzo al petto\nuna parte che si chiede perché\ncontinuamente
  e non si rassegna\nuna parte che segna il sorriso\nferita negli occhi, una cosa
  \nche porterai su di te come un marchio\nfino alla fine.\n                                                        \nTi
  ho vista entrare in ospedale\nDea svenutaa\ndi tutte le sigarette fumate\ne per
  mesi ho pensato\na quale sarebbe stata l’ultima parola\nche ti avrei detto, quindi
  finivo\nogni frase con ti amo.\nE oggi che il sole sembra\nnon farti più effetto\nspero
  almeno ci sia\nun sole più caldo di questo\nche ti aspetta da qualche parte\nnell’universo.\n
  \                                             \nTi ho telefonato\ntutti i giorni
  per dieci anni\ne ora che il tuo telefono squilla a vuoto\ncome potrò chiamarti?\nFacendo
  scendere tutte le stelle\nnel mio ufficio\naprendo la porta\ndel punto più chiaro
  del giorno\ndove la tua voce è acqua\ndi ogni rubinetto, ogni fiume,\ne dice: Valerio
  svegliati\ncome quando mi addormentavo\nsul divano. Ora la tua voce\ncanta la canzone
  di Marinella\ntra il vento degli alberi\ne fa del mio cuore una marcia lenta.\n
  \                                                       \nRideremo di questi giorni\ncon
  le mani celesti\nquando la testa ci esploderà\nd’amore per il segreto delle cose."
transpoem: "I wonder what you saw\nwhen you saw no more\nwhen for a few seconds\nthey
  turned off the lights in your eyes.\nYou stared at an impossible spot in the ceiling\nand
  I heard you leave, walk\non the wall, squeeze the hand of \nanother love.\nThen
  you returned and you hadn’t realized;\nam I on earth? you asked. And you looked
  at me.\nYes, you were on earth. You were my earth,\ntrembling under my feet.\n                                                     \nAnd
  so you reply well\nto those asking how are you\nthose who don’t see that hell is
  \nshaking you\ndo not see you leave behind their backs.\nOver time it all becomes
  normal\nyou say the universe knows the\nway better than you do and it happens\nto
  many and there is worse\nthere is always worse.\nBut a piece of sorrow remains\nswollen
  in the middle of the chest\na piece that continuously wonders \nwhy and does not
  subside \na piece that marks the smile\nwound in your eyes, something\nyou’ll take
  with you like a hallmark\ntill the end.\n\nI saw you enter the hospital\nfainted
  Goddess\nof all the cigarettes you smoked\nand for months I thought \nabout the
  last word\nI’d say to you, so I ended\nevery sentence with ti amo.\nAnd today when
  the sun seems\nto leave you indifferent\nI hope that at least\na sun warmer than
  this\nis waiting for you somewhere\nin the universe. \n\nI telephoned you\nevery
  day for ten years\nand now that your phone just rings out\nhow will I call you?\nMaking
  all the stars descend\ninto my office\nopening the door\nof the brightest point
  of day\nwhere your voice is water\nfrom every faucet, every river,\nand it says:
  Valerio wake up\nlike when I fall asleep\non the couch. Now your voice\nis singing
  the song of Marinella \namong the wind in the trees\nand turns my heart into a slow
  march.\n\nWe will laugh of these days,\nour hands azure,\nwhen our heads will explode\nout
  of love for the secret of things."
note: "<p>These poems are excerpted from <em>Dammi tue notizie e un bacio a tutti</em>
  (<em>Send Me Your News and Kisses to All</em>), a raw and earnest collection in
  which the poet journeys through the death of his mother, Giulia, who died from cancer
  after a brief but fierce battle. Mother and son are warriors who, lightsabers in
  hand, fight against the incurable illness. The poet courageously explores the feelings
  provoked by this suffering, unafraid to name and experience even the most heartbreaking
  of them. The book, however, doesn’t speak only of grief and pain, but also of profound
  love, ardent hope, and eventually even a kind of happiness that, while not dismissing
  the pain of loss, reconciles it within life.</p>\n\n<p>Firmly grounded in the grassroot
  origins of his poetic and artistic upbringing in anarchist and counterculture circles,
  Grutt brings together elements from Italian folk culture with echoes of Italy’s
  high poetic tradition of, for instance, Eugenio Montale. In his peculiar, down-to-earth
  yet highly lyrical style, Grutt does not shy away from exploring all corners of
  reality and human experience.</p>\n\n<p>This collection is very close to me, because
  when I first read it I had recently discovered that I was pregnant with my second
  child. For the first time in my life when reading a book — <em>this</em> book —
  I identified with the mother rather than the child. Whenever the poet called out
  to his mother, I was the person being called, not the caller. That’s why I chose
  to keep the invocations in Italian; I felt that the sense of emotional urgency they
  convey would be weakened if translated into English. Moreover, while it is common
  for English speakers to use “I love you” both for parental and romantic relations,
  “ti amo” is generally used between lovers, and its use here for his mother heightens
  the intensity of the poet’s love. This book played such a crucial role in the development
  of my identity as a mother, woman, and human being, that I stayed with these poems
  and mulled over translations of them in my head for the following three years. As
  often happens, translating the text was a way of metabolizing the poetic experience,
  making it my own so that I could in turn offer it to English readers.</p> "
abio: "<p>Valerio Grutt is an Italian poet, musician, and visual artist. An anarchist
  at heart and eclectic by nature, he has experimented with a vast range of expressions
  involving words, music, and rhythm, from hip hop to copywriting to explorations
  of the healing powers of poetry. After a brief stint as the director of the University
  of Bologna’s Center for Contemporary Poetry (2013 to 2016), he has returned to a
  life of vagabond quests: “I am someone who is constantly searching, writing, creating...
  I do not want limits or borders; I am a stray dog with a f*cking zest for life.”

tbio: "<p>Anna Aresi is an Italian translator and educator based in Rhode Island.
  She has translated poetry by English writing authors, such as Ewa Chrusciel, Forrest
  Gander, and Ilya Kaminsky into Italian, and poems by Edoardo Olmi, Mariangela Gualtieri,
  and Laura Corraducci into English. She occasionally translates from Russian too,
  and in 2021 was among the winners of the All-Russia State Library for Foreign Literature
  and The Institute for Literary Translation “Writers of the Silver Age about War”
