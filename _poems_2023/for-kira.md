poem: "23 квітня, у переддень Великодня російська \nракета влучила в житловий будинок
  в Одесі. \nВбито 8 людей, поранено 18.\nСеред загиблих — 3-місячна Кіра і її мати.\n\n23
  апреля, в преддверии Пасхи,\nроссийская ракета попала в жилой дом в \nОдессе. Убито
  8 людей, ранено 18. Среди \nпогибших 3х-месячная Кира и ее мама.\n\nКак вы там говорите
  — скорей бы мира?\nКоляска через ступеньку летит по лестнице.\nДевочку из Одессы
  назвали Кира.\nКире было три месяца.\n\nВ три месяца начинают держать игрушку,\nУчатся
  переворачиваться на спинку.\nВ три месяца человек похож на зверушку —\nБелочку или
  свинку.\n\nУлыбается маме, уставшей от вечных стирок,\nНачинает другие лица вокруг
  учить.\nКирина мама погибла в Одессе с Кирой,\nТеперь никто не сумеет их разлучить.\n\nУ
  мамы на запястье старая фенечка,\nСказали, что защитит. Видно, обманули.\nУ Киры
  в приданом — купальник размера \"феечка,\"\nДолжна была примерить его в июле.\n\nКак
  они там \"а давай напишем им 'с пасхой вас,'\nСейчас докурю и ракетку им в тыл закину.\"\nЖители
  ада выйдут, боясь испачкаться,\nНа дверях напишут:\n\"За Киру.\"\n\n\n\n"
transpoem: "On the 23rd of April [2022], just before Easter, a Russian rocket hit
  a civilian residence in Odessa. Eight people were killed, eighteen wounded. Among
  the dead were 3-month old Kira and her mother. \n\nWhat’s it called — let peace
  come quicker? \nThe step, the stairs, where a stroller flies over —\nIn Odessa,
  there was a girl\nwho was three months old. Her name was Kira. \n\nAt three months
  you might begin to teach her\nto hold a toy, to learn to turn on her back.\nAt three
  months a person looks like a squirrel,\nor a piglet — a small animal, a creature.
  \n\nShe smiles at her mom, who’s exhausted \nfrom infinite laundry. She’s solving
  the quandary \nof other faces around her, but she can’t separate\nfrom her mom now.
  Kira’s mom died in Odessa with Kira.\n\nOn the mom’s wrist was an old bauble, which
  they said \nwould protect her. That turned out to be a con. \nKira was about to
  inherit a fairy-sized swimsuit, \nwhich, in July, she was supposed to try on. \n\nSo
  they were like — “Let’s send them a ‘Happy Easter!’\nGonna finish this smoke and
  blow their brains out with a rocket.”\nThe dwellers of hell will crawl out, afraid
  to get stained, \nand write on the door:\n“For Kira.”"
note: "<p>The poem opens with an introduction in Ukrainian, with a Russian translation
  beneath it. The relationship Ukrainians have with the Russian language is complex.
  According to a survey from 2004, around 40% of Ukranians use Russian at home and
  between 70% and 90% understand the language, depending on the region. Despite the
  widespread use of Russian, the Ukrainian language is a flourishing one. A poll in
  2012 showed that 50% of adult Ukranians consider their native language to be Ukrainian,
  around 30% consider it to be Russian, and around 20% consider both to be their native
  languages. I’m not an expert in the language policies in Ukraine, or how Ukranians
  feel about Russian, about whether they feel unjustly compelled to learn or use it,
  even now. I can guess how they might feel about the Russian jokes that portray Ukrainian
  as “crude” or “funny-sounding.” I will say that it is sad and not surprising that
  languages, such as Russian and Ukrainian, that are incredibly rich and developed
  in literature, poetry, music, and film,  only begin to be studied once there is
  a crisis.</p>\n\n<p>The first phrase of this poem is “<em>Kak vi tam govorite?</em>”
  which is literally, “How do you say it there?” Is the “there” a veiled reference
  to the West, to the U.S., where it’s possible to have well-wishes about peace soon
  in Ukraine, but stay far removed from the actual war, from the remains of a three-month
  old flying over a staircase? Or is it simply an idiom, a casual way of saying “What’s
  it called?” I chose the latter, because it feels like more of an earworm phrase
  (as does the Russian), but am offering the former here as a possibility.</p>\n\n<p>A
  place where I departed from the literal meaning for the sake of sound is in the
  stanza beginning with “At three months, you might begin to teach her.” The original
  is “At three months, [general, collective they] learn to turn on their back.” I
  wanted to add the rhyme back into the translation, so I added “teach her” at the
  beginning of the stanza to rhyme with “creature” at the end. A place where I chose
  a better-known phrase in English instead of the more literal original is “blow their
  brains out with a rocket” (the original reads “send a rocket at their backs”).</p>
  \n\n<p>In general, the original poem has a fairly regular rhyme pattern, not unusual
  for Russian language poetry, but also definitely not a given in contemporary Russian
  poetry. I wanted to convey some of that rhyming sound in the translation, especially
  because in some places the original Russian rhyme scheme feels silly. While not
  contrived in terms of sound, it feels as if the rhymes came first and the phrases
  after, as if there was nothing to say, so the poet tried some rhyming phrases. This
  is most felt in the fourth stanza, with the images of the bauble bracelet and the
  not-yet-tried-on bathing suit. It feels like a desperate and absurd attempt to say
  at least something about the mind-boggling waste the war made of these lives. Did
  the mom actually buy a protective bracelet that didn’t work? Was there really a
  bathing suit the baby did not have a chance to try on? Maybe. But it doesn’t really
  matter. The rhyme of the poem creates some accompanying drumbeat, a cradle of sound,
  for these images to live in.</p>"
abio: "<p>Alina Khaitlina (b. 1987) is a poet and linguist born in 1987, and is from
  Leningrad, Russia. Formerly and well-known as Alya Kudryasheva, she became famous
  after posting some poems (especially her most well-known, “Mom is at the <em>dacha</em>,
  the key is on the table”) on her blog on <em>LiveJournal</em>. With the release
  of her first collection of poems in 2007, titled <em>It’s Open</em>, and which sold
  out its first print and was reprinted twice, she became one of the most read Russian
  language authors on <em>Livejournal</em>. What is unusual about Alina Khaitlina,
  and what the contemporary poetry world noticed, is that her poetry became known
  not just in the world of literary critics but among the general young population.
  Masses of followers in their twenties were reading her poetry and posting supportive
  comments on her blog. She is now known as one of the people who led to the revival
  of interest in poetry among Russian youth in the 2000s (poetry had gone out of style
  even in Russia at the time; it was seen as frivolous). Strikingly, she did not really
  consider herself a poet, even with her growing fame. She published academic work
  about poetry and sociolinguistics in the Russian deaf community and saw herself
  mostly as an academic, having moved to Germany for work in 2012. Yet, she is now
  considered one of the top “network poets” (a Russian category for poets who became
  famous on the internet) and has since been published in various anthologies, including
  one with COVID-themed poetry. Her second book of poems, <em>Sometimes Ships</em>,
  came out in 2016, and her book of poems for and about children, <em>Non-Fearful
  Cats</em>, came out in 2020.</p>"
