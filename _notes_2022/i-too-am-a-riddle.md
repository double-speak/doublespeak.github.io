transtitle: I, Too, Am a Riddle
author: Mahadevi Varma
translator: Anjali Gupta
poem: |-
  प्रिय! मैं हूँ एक पहेली भी !

  जितना मधु जितना मधुर हास
  जितना मद तेरी चितवन में
  जितना क्रन्दन जितना विषाद
  जितना विष जग के स्पन्दन में
  पी पी मैं चिर दुख-प्यास बनी
  सुख-सरिता की रंगरेली भी !

  मेरे प्रतिरोमों से अविरत,
  झरते हैं निर्झर और आग;
  करती विरक्ति आसक्ति प्यार,
  मेरे श्वासों में जाग जाग;
  प्रिय मैं सीमा की गोदपली
  पर हूँ असीम से खेली भी !
transpoem: "My love, I, too, am a riddle.\n\nThe nectar, the honeyed laughter, \nThe
  lust in your glances, \nThe lamentation, the despair, \nAll the poison in this quivering
  world.  \n\nI drink, I drink it all, and yet I thirst for sorrow \nAnd bathe in
  the river of joy. \n\nFrom every fiber of my being \nBoth the fire and water fall.
  \nRenunciation and devotion join \nIn my panting breath. \n\nMy love, I was born
  to the lap of limitation,\nBut I, too, have loved in the limitless."

  <p>This poem speaks to me of duality, conflict, and devotion. I really wanted to convey the complexity and confusion in this poem. There is a palpable tension and urgency that needs to be prioritized. </p>
  <p>As in all translations, I had to compromise. I struggled with the translation of <span lang= "hi">प्रिय</span> (<em>priya</em>), appearing as both the poem’s first word and towards the end. The whole poem hinges on this one word. Because it is a direct address, it sets the tone for the poem and makes it an intimate conversation. Previous translators conveyed this as “beloved,” and “dear one.” These felt antiquated and awkward to me. I chose to translate this as “my love” because it felt more colloquial and like a gentle whisper. </p>
  <p>Another thing I struggled with is the loss of linguistic and cultural ancestors when words are dragged from Hindi to English. For example, in line 3, the word <span lang= "hi">मद</span> (<em>mad</em>) means something along the lines of “intoxicant,” “frenzy,” and “lust” and has visual connotations of liquid oozing. I could not find the elusive perfect word in English. When words are used, historical and cultural histories are invoked. As I have supplanted this poem across languages, the history and culture is altered. As the poet draws on mythologies and literature, I straddle the line between truth to tradition and to the flow of the narrative.</p>
  <p>I present this translation from a place of vulnerability. As a third-generation American, I am not a native speaker of the language that my grandparents speak and that I am translating here. I can only promise that I have chosen each word, down to the syllable, with the utmost care and with the loving help of my grandmother.</p>
