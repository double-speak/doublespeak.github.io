author: Zusman Segalovitsh
translator: Betsy Morgan
poem: "איך האב געזען, ווי די זון האָט באַלויכטן הריגה,\nאיך האָב געזען, וואָס מענטש האָט
  פון מענטשן געמאַכט,\nאון די האַרץ האָט געיאָמערט און האַרץ האָט געשוויגן...\nניט אומזיסט
  איז מיר טייער געוואָרן די נאַכט.\n \nמען קען בלויז דעם קערפּער באַהאַלטן, פאַרהוילן,\nדער
  דמיון בלייבט היימלאָז און האַרץ איז ניט בלינד.\nזאָלן קלאָגן די וויסטע שאָסייען פון
  פּוילן,\nזאָל וויינען מיט בלוט פאַר אונדז אלע דער ווינט. \n\n<h1>פאַרלעש די זון</h1>\n\nאַלמעכטיקער!
  און זאָל דאָס זיין דיין ווילן\nניט שווייגן מער און ניט פאַרגעבן...\nפאַרבלוטיקט קומט
  צו דיר מיין לעצטע תפילה:\nפאַרלעש די זון, די ליכט פון לעבן.\n \nפאַרלעש די זון און
  גיב זיי דיינע ברואים\nדעם שוואַרצן חושך פון די מכות.\nפאַר’סם דאָס פעלד, פאַרברען
  די לעצטע תבואה,\nגענוג צו האָדעוון די ליידאַקעס..."
transpoem: "I have seen how the sun shines upon slaughter, \nI have seen what Man
  has made of men,\nAnd my heart has moaned and my heart has been quiet...\nIt’s no
  wonder the night has become dear, then.\n \nOne can only cover the bodies, conceal
  them,\nFor the image still wanders and my heart is not blind.\nLet the barren roads
  of Poland wail,\nLet the wind cry with blood for all of our kind.\n\n<h1>Extinguish
  the Sun (<em>Farlesh Di Zun</em>)</h1>\n\nAlmighty! And may it be Your will:\nNo
  more silence, no forgiving... \nMy final prayer comes to You bloodied:\nExtinguish
  the sun, the light of living.\n \nExtinguish the sun and give Your creations\nThe
  black darkness of the Plagues.\nPoison the fields, burn the last of the crops,\nEnough
  to feed those who had cruel ways...\n\n"

  I chose to translate these two poems, as they share a motif of sunlight portrayed negatively. I usually associate sunlight with hope and joy, so seeing it used here to highlight the cruelty of man, or as this entity that should be blunted, as a curse to the world, was very striking.
  </p>
  <p>
  I understood the line “what Man has made of men” to describe the evil humanity is capable of perpetrating. To emphasize this interpretation, as well as to highlight the slightly unusual choice of man in both singular and plural (<em>mentsh</em> and <em>mentshn</em> in Yiddish), I chose to capitalize Man.
  </p>

  In the line “For the image still wanders and my heart is not blind,” the Yiddish has the word <em>homloz</em>. The literal English translation of “homeless” evokes different emotions in English than the original Yiddish, so I used the word “wanders” instead, which seemed to better express my understanding that while one can physically cover the source of the horror, the dead bodies, the horror still stays within. The image of this horror is homeless, meaning it wanders inside such that the heart cannot avert its “eyes.”
  </p>
  <p>
  For “Let the wind cry with blood for all of our kind,” the Yiddish uses the phrase <em>far undz ale</em> literally, “for us all.” Who is the “us”? Is it Jewish people? Is it humankind? I chose to use “for all of our kind,” believing this portion of the poem to be specially about Jews, since the phrase “barren roads of Poland” seems to reference the nearly three million Polish Jews killed. Such a severe decrease in the population would make roads, especially in previously predominantly Jewish areas, seem starkly barren.

  The two poems are from the collection entitled <em>Dortn</em> (<em>There</em>, 1946), referring to pre-Holocaust Poland. I first read selections from <em>Dortn</em> on Tisha B’Av, the fast day in the Jewish calendar that commemorates the destruction of the ancient Jewish temples. In the last decades, it has become common for Jewish people to recount the tragedy of the Holocaust as a way to approach this 2,000-year-old tragedy. While reading these poems of horror, loss, and grief, I also found beauty. In flipping through the book, I opened to a spot where yellow flowers, stems still attached, had been pressed between the pages. I can never know who placed these flowers or when. Though the flower presser is most certainly gone, their flowers, the book itself, and the language are not.

  Zusman Segalovitsh was born in Białystok, Poland in 1884. He wrote in both Russian and Yiddish and penned both poetry and prose. His books were well read in Poland. Segalovitsh had multiple close encounters with death during his life: a 1906 pogrom in Białystok, serving in the Russian army for a year, and fleeing the Holocaust between 1939 and 1941 before finally arriving in Tel Aviv. In his escape, he went through Lithuania, Russia, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Syria. During and after the war, he dedicated himself to memorializing Polish Jewry in his writings. <em>Dortn</em> was published in 1946, three years before his passing.

  Betsy Morgan began learning Yiddish during her time at Drexel University (’18) studying Materials Science and Engineering. Ever since that first immersive Yiddish learning program at Yiddish Farm in New York in 2015, Betsy has been listening to, reading, and trying to speak more Yiddish. Originally from the Philadelphia area, Betsy now lives with her husband in Haifa, Israel.
