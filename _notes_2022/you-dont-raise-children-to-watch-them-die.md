poem: "                                                             Cuando el mar
  se llevó a sus tres hijos Ella\n                                                             estaba
  acodada en la puerta de su casa, pensando \n                                                             en
  ollas aladas y repletas. De pronto cayó en \n                                                             un
  vacío del que surgió vieja y encorvada. No \n                                                             necesitó
  entrar para vestirse de negro. Ya estaba \n                                                             recogiendo
  ﬂores cuando salió su hombre con la \n                                                             radio
  en la mano, desamparado y tembloroso.\n\n\nElla es una sábana ﬂotando sobre nosotros.\nNada
  detiene el remolino que alienta su vuelo.\nDesde su vientre deshabitado\nlos ovarios
  violeta se abren como ﬂores nocturnas.\nLa ansiedad es un arrecife\ndonde acerados
  corales hieren los cuerpos amados.\n\nSin hijos bajo sus ojos\nquisiéramos las madres\nofrecerle
  un trozo de pañal\npara vendar sus muñones o un arca\ndonde recoger los salados
  restos.\n"

  sea took away her three sons She \n                                                             was
  leaning in the doorway of her home, thinking \n                                                             of
  winged and brimming pots. Suddenly she fell into\n                                                             an
  abyss, from which she emerged old and hunched. She didn’t \n                                                             need
  to go inside to be dressed in black. She was already \n                                                             gathering
  flowers when her husband came outside with the \n                                                             radio
  in his hand, helpless and trembling.\n \nShe is a sheet floating above us.\nNothing
  restrains the whirlwind that keeps her aloft.\nFrom her deserted womb\nviolet ovaries
  unfurl like night-blooming flowers.\nAnxiety is a reef\nwhere sharpened corals wound
  beloved bodies.\n\nWithout children in her sight\nwe mothers would like\nto offer
  her a piece of diaper cloth\nto bandage her stumps or an ark\nto gather the salty
  remains.\n"

  <p>This poem originally appeared in <em>Hijos</em> (<em>Children</em>, 1991), a sublimely beautiful collection of Muñoz’s poems centered around pregnancy and motherhood. This image-rich, heart-aching piece — the final poem in the collection — is based on a real event from the time. In a historical context, such tragedies occur all too often in the maritime culture of Chiloé, as perhaps they do in other places, and the individual loss and grief conveyed become universal in significance. The particular language and imagery of Muñoz’s poetry, however, is specific to the culture, lore and landscape of the Chiloé archipelago, and is one of the most essential elements throughout her entire body of work.</p>
  <p>We learn of the tragic loss in the first line and throughout the first stanza. In robbing her of her children, the sea not only took them — <em>se los llevó</em>, but “took them away”; the line becomes more similar in length to the original and emphasizes the loss. While their mother leaned in the doorway, awaiting their safe return and anticipating a successful catch, the pots of fish and seafood stew she was already planning would not merely be full, but <em>rebosantes</em> — “brimming” in joyous abundance. The traditional clay pots, with handles like folded “wings,” embody the magic of the hearth, the reward for such hard, often dangerous, labor at sea. She is endowed by the poet — a mother of three herself — with a powerful, unquestionable sense of maternal intuition. She somehow knows and feels the ultimate loss before her husband hears the tragic news reported on the radio. An abyss of devastation swallows her and spits her out, shrunken and aged. In a traditional culture not unfamiliar with tragedies at sea, it isn’t odd that she is already “dressed in black” and “gathering flowers” by the time he comes outside, “helpless and trembling.”</p>
  <p>The second stanza addresses not only the mother in the first stanza, but all grieving mothers, forever unmoored. In the second line, my approach to translating the image into English resulted in a more adaptive choice. From the original, “nada detiene el remolino que alienta su vuelo,” <em>remolino</em> can mean a whirlpool or a whirlwind. Instead of the more obvious reference to water, I chose the reference to air, for its connection to the rest of the phrase, <em>que alienta su vuelo</em> (“that encourages her flight”), and settled on “nothing restrains the whirlwind that keeps her aloft.”</p>
  <p>Without children of her own in sight, she is maimed forever by the loss. The other mothers know there’s no possible consolation, but can only offer gestures of compassion.</p>
abio: "<p>Rosabetty Muñoz is a Chilean poet and teacher from the southern city of
  Ancud, on the island of Chiloé. Her lifelong dedication to both poetry and education
  are matched by her dedication to the people and places she has always known, and
  always refused to move away from. Her entire body of work is infused with and inspired
  by Chilote landscape, culture and legends, as well as the inevitable, present-day
  clash of changing cultures. Passionate about language, she seeks to inspire her
  students, and her readers in general, to become enchanted by the words they hear.
  Her own voice has been described as uncomplicated, often minimalist in appearance,
  yet deeply metaphysical and complex, sounding at times almost like a prayer or a
  hymn that moves the reader into a contemplative state. Her titles include <em>Canto
  de una oveja del rebaño</em>, <em>En lugar de morir</em>, <em>Hijos</em>, <em>Baile
  de señoritas</em>, <em>La santa: Historia de su elevación</em>, <em>Sombras en el
  Rosselot</em>, <em>Ratada</em>, <em>En nombre de ninguna</em>, and the anthology
  <em>Misión circular</em>. Her work has appeared in international anthologies, and
  has claimed many notable prizes, including the Pablo Neruda Prize and the Altazor,
  among many others. She has also been named a member of the Academia Chilena de la
  Lengua.</p>"
