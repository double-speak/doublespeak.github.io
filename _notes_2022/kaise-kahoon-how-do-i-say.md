note: "<p>As a heritage speaker, I can easily navigate nonchalant conversations about
  the usual suspects:  the frigid nature of gray Philadelphia winters, the heinous
  pile of chemistry homework that awaits me, the satisfying taste of my morning Metropolitan
  Bakery bagel, and the like. It is usually the pretentious, sophisticated words that
  elude me. Though reading and writing Hindi at a fourth-grade level and being conversationally
  fluent may seem like a masterful feat, I struggle to  maintain conversations with
  my own flesh and blood. I wish to discuss politics with my relatives;  I want to
  empathize with their emotions; I hope to understand their life histories. While
  my thoughts and abilities to express myself in English have grown from a liberal
  arts college education, my Hindi lags far…<em>far</em> behind. As my mind races
  ahead and the conversation continues forth, my lips are still floundering to summon
  seemingly simple words. My vocabulary  precludes me, and those opportunities to
  connect remain far out of reach. </p>\n<p>Beyond seeking deeper connections through
  conversation, there is also the matter of discussion topics riddled with taboo.
  Communicating about uncomfortable subjects is difficult enough in one’s native tongue,
  so how does a second-generation Indian American girl who has just lost her virginity
  ask her mom about “emergency contraception”? How does a prepubescent Sikh boy discovering
  his sexuality question “masturbation” in Punjabi? If I struggle to remember the
  \ Hindi translations for “government” or “calendar,” how can I possibly conjure
  a translation for  “intimacy” or “consent”? To this day, I have not heard anyone
  say the Hindi word for “sex.” Translations aside, do certain words even exist? What
  is “lesbian” or “orgasm” or “foreplay”? I  could not tell you, nor do I feel comfortable
  asking the people in my life who could perhaps enlighten me.</p>\n<p>Delving into
  this notion further, what does this mean for the cultural phenomenon colloquially
  known as the “sex talk”? Parents brought up in the United States awkwardly struggle
  to teach their children about puberty and sex — or some abstain from it altogether
  and allow school systems to handle the task — but at least there is a shared language
  between parent and child that confers some level of openness to sexual communication
  channels. Even if it is not discussed, American television shows, films, books,
  and social media tell us about cherries popping and sixty-nining. These are words
  I can put to paper, and regardless of how squeamish they may make the reader, the
  concept is understood. How does a Muslim American girl tell her immigrant mother
  she had premarital sex and discovered she has a pelvic floor disorder requiring
  gynecologic therapy? How does a Tamil American boy still on his parents’ health
  insurance explain to them that he is gay and wishes to begin HIV prevention medication?
  There is perhaps an inherent timidness for a child to reveal their sexual activity
  to a parent that is only heightened when we add elements such as religious transgression,
  compulsory heterosexuality, culturally rooted stigmas, and a complete lack of language
  equivalency through which a child of immigrants might make their parents understand.</p>\n<p>Let
  us extend this further to gender identity or sexual orientation. A young person
  struggling with their gender identity can attempt to put into words what they feel.
  \ They can utilize vocabulary such as “queer,” “nonbinary,” or “transgender” to
  effectively communicate their non-heteronormative identity. What does a young South
  Asian American individual do? They do not have a cultural equivalent in their parents’
  native tongue to help them understand this identity, let alone the verbiage to express
  it. There are other non-heteronormative identities native or known to South Asia,
  including <em>hijra</em> in Hinduism or <em>khuntha</em> in Islam, but what is queerness?
  Not only is there a lack of word equivalents, but also a lack of cultural equivalents.
  How does this person explicate to their South Asian-born parents what exactly they
  feel — who exactly they are?</p> \n<p>And yet, we cannot blame. There is no one
  and nothing to blame. There is only the simple fact that the key understandings
  in American culture communicated through English are distinct from understandings
  in South Asian culture that are communicated through Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Marathi,
  Telugu, and other languages and dialects in India, Pakistan and other regions. The
  messages are quite literally lost in translation. Unfortunately, the potential impacts
  of this are far-reaching and truly ominous. Initially, insufficient sexual education
  and closed communication channels can result in inexperience, discomfort, and confusion.
  Then perhaps experimentation and promiscuity for some, but repression and deep-rooted
  fear for others. What next? Lying, rebellion, broken family ties.  Insecurity, miscommunication,
  unmet desires. The ultimate manifestation involves a myriad of documented experiences
  with negative impacts to individuals’ sexual, mental, and physical well-being: lack
  of access to birth control, verbal abuse, struggles to receive the HPV vaccine,
  hidden sexual orientations, misinformation given to medical providers, and broken
  households.</p> \n<p>And somehow, it can all be traced back to not knowing how to
  even say “sex.”</p>\n"

  Simran Chand recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in December 2021, double-majoring in biology and Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies. She grew up speaking Hindi and English simultaneously, simply through exposure to her parents’ native tongue. She took Hindi grammar lessons through her early years of high school with Kishori Barman, a passionate resident of Newtown, Connecticut, committed to teaching the surrounding area’s  South Asian youth the beauty of the Hindi language. With a vested interest in ethnic identity,  gender/sexuality, and healthcare, Simran is the author of an honors research thesis documenting trends of familial sexual education amongst South Asian Americans at Penn. Simran plans to attend medical school while continuing to investigate the intersections of identity and medicine.
