transtitle: The Vultures
author: David Diop
translator: Samantha DeStefano
poem: |
  En ce temps-là
  A coups de gueule de civilisation
  A coups d’eau bénite sur les fronts domestiqués
  Les vautours construisaient à l’ombre de leurs serres
  Le sanglant monument de l’ère tutélaire
  En ce temps-là
  Les rires agonisaient dans l’enfer métallique des routes
  Et le rythme monotone des Pater-Noster
  Couvraient les hurlements des plantations à profit
  O le souvenir acide des baisers arrachés
  Les promesses mutilées au choc des mitrailleuses
  Hommes étranges qui n’étiez pas des hommes
  Vous saviez tous les livres vous ne saviez pas l’amour
  Et les mains qui fécondent le ventre de la terre
  Les racines de nos mains profondes comme la révolte
  Malgré vos chants d’orgueil au milieu des charniers
  Les villages désolés l’Afrique écartelée
  L’espoir vivait en nous comme une citadelle
  Et des mines du Souaziland à la sueur lourde des usines d’Europe
  Le printemps prendra chair sous nos pas de clarté.

  In those days
  With the rantings of civilization
  With blows of holy water on domesticated foreheads
  The vultures built in the shadow of their talons
  The bloody monument of the guardian era
  In those days
  Laughter lay dying in the metallic hell of the roads
  And the monotonous rhythm of the Paternosters
  Drowned out the howls of the plantations for profit
  O the acid memory of snatched kisses
  The promises mutilated by the shock of machine guns
  Strange men who were not men
  You knew all the books you did not know love
  And the hands that fertilize the womb of the earth
  The roots of our hands deep as revolt
  In spite of your songs of pride in the midst of mass graves
  The desolate villages Africa torn apart
  Hope lived in us like a citadel
  And from the mines of Swaziland to the heavy sweat of the factories of Europe
  Spring will take flesh under our steps of light.

  David Diop’s “The Vultures” describes the destructive collaboration of Christian missionaries and French colonizers in Africa. Translator Ulli Beier renders the second line (“à coups de gueule de civilisation”) as “when civilization kicked us in the face” by reading “coups de gueule” as a literal composite of <em>coups</em> (“blows”) and <em>gueule</em> (an informal word for “mouth, face”). However, “coup de gueule” is an idiom that means “roar, yell, rant, tirade,” so I translated this line as “with the rantings of civilization.” I translated <em>domestiqués</em> as “domesticated,” rather than its secondary meaning of “controlled, subjugated,” to show that the Christian missionaries who helped colonize Africa sought to erase traditional African culture and replace it with European culture under the guise of “domesticating” and allegedly improving Black people. Before Diop describes the physical violence of colonization, he condemns the cultural imperialism that supported it, which relied as much on “all the books” as on “machine guns.” He immediately dismisses the racist ideology that justified the spread of “civilization” as mere “rantings,” establishing the hopeful promise of the poem’s conclusion.

  The Paternoster is the Lord’s Prayer, which Jesus used to teach his disciples how to pray just as Europeans forced Africans to follow their Christian practices. I translated <em>couvrait</em> as its more intense secondary meaning, “drowned out,” instead of the literal “covered,” to emphasize how missionary activities dismissed the brutal realities of slavery.

  In the poem’s penultimate line, Diop traces how European colonial nations’ industrial production used raw materials taken from African colonies. By connecting the exploitation of Swaziland (now Eswatini, its indigenous pre-colonial name), a Southern African nation colonized by the British, to his own heritage in West Africa under French rule, he expresses the Négritude movement’s Pan-African solidarity and hope for global Black liberation.

  David Diop was born to a Senegalese father (a cousin of poet and Senegalese president Léopold Sédar Senghor) and a Cameroonian mother in 1927 in Bordeaux, France. Throughout his life, he divided his time between West Africa and France. He was a radical voice of Négritude, a twentieth-century Francophone African and Caribbean literary movement that was partly inspired by the Harlem Renaissance and Black poets such as Langston Hughes. Négritude’s goal was to promote pride in a rich Black culture as a reaction against oppressive French colonial rule. Diop’s protest poetry is more militant than that of African poets like Senghor. His writings display the commitment to African liberation and revolt against colonialism found in Caribbean poets like Aimé Césaire. Diop contributed poems to <em>Présence Africaine</em> (<em>African Presence</em>), an influential Parisian political and literary magazine of the African diaspora. In 1956, he published his only book, <em>Coups de pilon</em> (<em>Pestle Blows</em>), which was translated into English, along with additional poems and prose pieces, as <em>Hammer Blows and Other Writings</em> in 1973. He died in a plane crash near Dakar, Senegal, in 1960, days before Senghor was elected the first president of the newly independent nation.
