poem: "วันนั้นพระอภัยมณีศรีสุวรรณ             \nจรจรัลเข้ามาถึงหน้าบ้าน\nเห็นลิขิตปิดไว้กับใบทวาร
  \               \nพระทรงอ่านแจ้งจิตในกิจจา\nอันท่านครูอยู่ตึกตำแหน่งนี้               \nฝีปากปี่เป่าเสนาะเพราะหนักหนา\nจึงดำรัสตรัสแก่ยา
  \                           \n อันวิชาสิ่งนี้พี่ชอบใจ\nอนุชาว่าการกลศึก                             \nน้องนี้นึกรักมาแต่ไหนไหน\nถ้าเรียนรู้รำกระบองได้ว่องไว
  \            \nจะชิงชัยข้าศึกไม่นึกเกรง\nพระเชษฐาว่าจริงแล้วเจ้าพี่                \nวิชามีแล้วใครไม่ข่มเหง\nแต่ใจพี่นี้รักทางนักเลง
  \                      \nหมายว่าเพลงดนตรีนี้ดีจริง\nถึงการเล่นเป็นที่ประโลมโลก             \nได้ดับโศกสูญหายทั้งชายหญิง\nแต่ขัดสนจนจิตคิดประวิง
  \                   \nด้วยทรัพย์สิ่งหนึ่งนี้ไม่มีมา ฯ\nศรีสุวรรณปัญญาฉลาดแหลม             \nจึงยิ้มแย้มเยื้อนตอบพระเชษฐา\nธำมรงค์เรือนมณีมีราคา
  \                     \nจะคิดค่าควรแสนตำลึงทอง\nพอบูชาอาจารย์เอาต่างทรัพย์            \nเห็นจะรับสอนสั่งเราทั้งสอง\nอันตัวน้องนี้จะอยู่ด้วยครูกระบอง
  \      \nหัดให้คล่องเชี่ยวชาญชำนาญดี\nขอพระองค์จงเสด็จไปท้ายบ้าน         \nอยู่ศึกษาอาจารย์ข้างดีดสี\nครั้นเสร็จสมปรารถนาไม่ช้าที
  \            \nจะตามพี่ไปหาที่อาจารย์"
transpoem: "That day, Phra Aphai Mani and Sri Suwan arrived \nin front of the house
  and saw that fateful door closed. \nHis Majesty read the missive upon it, \nproving
  it is the house of a musical maestro.\n“That teacher who lives here, yet is now
  absent, \nplays his flute with sonorousness equal \nto his seriousness.” Thus, His
  Majesty’s speech, \nfull of passionate vigor, let slip his passion \nfor the musical
  arts. By way of reply, \nthe younger prince shared a passion denied­—\nthat he should
  deign to learn the art of war.\nIf only he could dance sveltely with his poleaxe,
  \nall foes would be at his fearless mercy.\nThe elder prince thought, it’s true,
  mastering \nthese martial arts is a virtue unassailable.\nWhile he longed for more
  vulgar things, \nas can be found in the musical arts, \nthe old master’s song crept
  into his heart.\nWith a flute at his lips, he was transported \naway from his struggles
  as notions \nof manliness and womanliness faded \ninto the musical void.His longing
  to play \nturned into thoughts of delay, in consideration \nof what treasure he
  needed to pay \nto learn to make song.The younger Sri Suwan, \nusually quite cunning,
  allowed himself \nan indelicate grin in answer to his elder brother. \nMy rings
  and glittering baubles have some worth, \nperhaps a thousand talent-weights of gold—\nPerhaps
  enough to convince our teachers \nto accept other treasures, and accept us \nas
  students both. As for me, older brother, \nI shall endeavor to learn my martial
  arts well \nto master my poleaxe professionally.\nI pray, my dear elder brother,
  bide your time here \nin wait of your maestro. When you’re finished, \nmy artistic
  king and brother, I’ll come quickly \nto meet you here at your maestro’s place."

  <em>Phra Aphai Mani</em> is a 48,700-line epic poem written by the poet Sunthorn Phu between 1821 and 1845. The male protagonist of the poem is Phra Aphai Mani, a keen musician who plays the flute. Nineteenth-century Thai literature was often centered on male warrior figures known for their martial prowess. For example, <em>I-nao</em>, written during the early Rattanakosin Period, portrays the titular protagonist as an expert in the use of daggers. <em>Kraithong</em> by King Rama II is about a hero who kills crocodiles. <em>Khobut</em>, written by Sunthorn Phu during the reign of King Rama I, is about Kobut, the son of the Sun, who has special power to resurrect the dead. <em>Singha Krai Phop</em>, also written by Sunthorn Phu during the reign of King Rama II and III, is about a child raised by a giant demon who drinks milk from a lion during infancy.

  Most of Thai literature during the early Rattanakosin Period—from the reign of King Rama to that of King Rama IV—was written by or for the monarchy. Therefore, the masculine stereotype was emphasized to glorify the King’s power. Male characters were usually heroes and warriors who protected their kingdom. <em>Phra Aphai Mani</em> is different. Originally, Sunthorn Phu wrote the poem due to financial issues, as he was imprisoned after injuring a high-ranking officer. He had the freedom to break such stereotypes. He depicted Phra Aphai Mani as a musician who does not have any superpowers or martial skills. He uses his musical mastery to charm and flirt with women. He is not a fighter and is rather sentimental. In fact, Phra Aphai Mani echoes the personality of Sunthorn Phu himself in many ways. For instance, Sunthorn Phu was famously known as an alcoholic who, when drunk, followed his feelings and passions rather than rationality. Sunthorn Phu was also an incorrigible flirt and had two wives and numerous lovers. In much the same way, Phra Aphai Mani has five wives.

  As regards to the rhyme scheme, Phra Aphai Mani is written in Klon Suphap. Each line consists of seven to nine syllables. Each stanza has two lines and each line is divided into two clauses. There is a complex set of rhymes, and Sunthorn Phu’s signature scheme of internal rhyming adds complication to it. He rhymes the syllables within each clause as opposed to rhyming across clauses.

  Sunthorn Phu (1786–1855), widely acclaimed as “Thailand’s Shakespeare,” lived during the Rattanakosin Period between the reigns of King Rama I and King Rama IV. He was famous for his epic poetry and memoirs. He invented “internal rhyming” — rhymes within each half-line in addition to the standard Klon Suphap rhyme scheme — which became his signature. In 1986, he was honored by UNESCO as a world poet, and Thai children study his poems to this day.

  We decided to translate this poem because it challenges the male stereotype of warriorship. Sunthorn Phu rejects this stereotype by portraying the lead character, Phra Aphai Mani, as a keen musician instead of a great warrior. We would also like to raise awareness of the works of Thailand’s most celebrated author — Amazon currently has only one listing for Phu’s work. It is nonetheless challenging to transfer the beautiful rhymes of Thai into another language, and most of Sunthorn Phu’s works are lengthy.
