  II
  Опять поминальный приблизился час.
  Я вижу, я слышу, я чувствую вас:

  И ту, что едва до окна довели,
  И ту, что родимой не топчет земли,

  И ту, что, красивой тряхнув головой,
  Сказала: «Сюда прихожу, как домой».

  Хотелось бы всех поименно назвать,
  Да отняли список, и негде узнать.

  Для них соткала я широкий покров
  Из бедных, у них же подслушанных слов.

  О них вспоминаю всегда и везде,
  О них не забуду и в новой беде,

  И если зажмут мой измученный рот,
  Которым кричит стомильонный народ,

  Пусть так же они поминают меня
  В канун моего поминального дня.

  А если когда-нибудь в этой стране
  Воздвигнуть задумают памятник мне,

  Согласье на это даю торжество,
  Но только с условьем — не ставить его

  Ни около моря, где я родилась:
  Последняя с морем разорвана связь,

  Ни в царском саду у заветного пня,
  Где тень безутешная ищет меня,

  А здесь, где стояла я триста часов
  И где для меня не открыли засов.

  Затем, что и в смерти блаженной боюсь
  Забыть громыхание черных марусь,

  Забыть, как постылая хлопала дверь
  И выла старуха, как раненый зверь.

  И пусть с неподвижных и бронзовых век,
  Как слезы, струится подтаявший снег,

  И голубь тюремный пусть гулит вдали,
  И тихо идут по Неве корабли.

  Март 1940

transpoem: "II\nAgain, the time for remembrance draws near.\nIt’s you who I see, who
  I feel, who I hear:\n\nHer, barely standing in that window alone,\nAnd her, from
  her native lands long ago flown,\n\nAnd her, having shaken her beautiful head,\nSaying:
  “Here, like it’s home, is where I come instead.”\n\nI would like to call them all
  out by name,\nBut the list’s been taken and no trace remains.\n\nAnd for them I’ve
  woven a wide, wide shroud,\nMade of the poor words well known by this crowd.\n\nI’ll
  remember them always and in everything.\nDespite tribulations that fate’s yet to
  bring.\n\nIf they’re to be clamped, my tormented lips,\nThat scream for the millions
  of souls on those lists,\n\nThen let them remember me in this very sense,\nOn the
  eve of my day of remembrance.\n\nIn this country, if it were ever conceived\nTo
  raise up a statue in memory of me,\n\nI’d lend agreement to this exultation.\nAlthough,
  be it with just one stipulation —\n\nPlease not near the Black Sea where I was born,\nMy
  last bonds to the sea were long ago torn.\n\nNor by cherished stumps of Tsar’s Garden
  trees,\nWhere a desolate shadow searches for me,\n\nBut here, where I’ve stood for
  three hundred hours \nWhere the doors remained closed, bolted shut with a glower.\n\nBecause,
  even in blissful death I would still fear\nForgetting Black Marias rumbling near,\n\nForgetting
  how odious side doors slammed close,\nHow an old woman’s scream like a maimed beast
  arose. \n\nAnd let through unmoving, bronze eyelids there flow\nA trickle of tears,
  as of new-melted snow,\n\nAnd let in the distance prison pigeons cry\nAnd ships
  along the Neva gently go by.\n\nMarch 1940\nFontanka House\n"

  <p>Epilogue II concludes Akhmatova’s <em>Requiem</em>, an elegy reflecting on the Great Terror (1936–1938). During this period, Stalin’s regime targeted ethnic minorities, those with ties to non-socialist countries, Soviet intelligentsia, and “anti-Soviet elements” (an intentionally broad term used to justify arrests). Millions of Soviet citizens were subjected to state violence. Written from Akhmatova’s perspective as she stood in lines with other women, waiting to see their loved ones in prison, <em>Requiem</em> memorializes the collective suffering of Soviet peoples during the Terror and immortalizes its victims and survivors.</p>
  <p>In <em>Requiem</em>, Akhmatova implements imagery of state violence that plays large roles in historical memory surrounding the Great Terror. The names of those targeted by authorities were placed on lists, signed by the high-ranking Soviet officials in the state security apparatus, and led to the arrests and prosecution of millions of Soviet citizens. “Black Marias” refer to the cars used by NKVD raids, which happened with little to no notice and often at night.</p>
  <p>This translation is the result of several hours spent poring over the same lines. Having mostly translated prose, I don’t usually pay as much attention to rhyme and meter, but I felt the need to do this poem justice in maintaining the AABB rhyme scheme and eleven-syllable meter. Akhmatova’s attention to rhyme and meter in her work allows for an emotional spiral in its recitation. This is particularly evident in Akhmatova’s recitations of <em>Requiem</em>, which are widely available online.</p>
abio: |-
  <p>Anna Akhmatova was born in Odessa (in modern-day Ukraine) in 1889 to Russian and Ukrainian parents of noble descent. At a young age, Akhmatova moved to Tsarskoye Selo, a literary capital of the Russian world just outside of Saint Petersburg, where she studied at the village’s esteemed Lyceum. She began writing poetry when she was eleven years old. Her work was influenced by Aleksandr Pushkin, Nikolai Nekrasov, and the Symbolist Movement. After marrying her first husband Nikolai Gumilev, Akhmatova moved to Saint Petersburg in 1910, where she became involved in artists’ circles, meeting other poets like Osip Mandelstam and Marina Tsvetaeva. In poetry, Akhmatova was highly influential in the Acmeism Movement.</p>
  <p>Following the formation of the USSR, her husband was executed for alleged conspiracy against the state. As the widow of an alleged anti-Bolshevik figure, it was hard for Akhmatova to find work outside of translation after Gumilev’s death. She started a relationship with Nikolai Punin following the death of her first husband, but Punin was sentenced to hard labor in a Gulag. Her son Lev Gumilev was also imprisoned on suspicion of his bourgeois and anti-Bolshevik heritage. Her work was censored by state authorities during the Stalinist period because of its “overly feminine” qualities and “bourgeois elements.”</p>
  <p>Anna Akhmatova is one of the few poets of her time who was targeted by the state and lived to an old age, receiving more widespread recognition in the Krushchev period. She continues to inspire future generations of poets around the world.</p>
