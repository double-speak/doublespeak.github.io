  Kláskem hubeným je tělo tvé
  z nějž zrno vypadlo a nevzlící
  jak klásek hubený je tělo tvé

  Přadenem z hedvábí je tělo tvé
  toužením popsané do vrásky poslední
  jak přadeno z hedvábí je tělo tvé

  Spáleným nebem je tělo tvé
  čivavě v tkáni smrtka sní
  jak spálené nebe je tělo tvé

  Přetiché je tělo tvé
  jeho pláč zachvívá mými víčky
  jak tiché je tělo tvé

  <h1>Jistota</h1>

  Vcházím do lásky a oslepen
  tápám klopýtaje o tmu minulou
  milostí tvojí zasažen

  Prohledám náhle a již vím
  není mi dáno zůstat v tomto ráji
  tolik jsem prahnul a přece sem nepatřím

  Míjím ač ničeho se nezříkám
  zahleděn v tvé oči vznešené
  půl smrt půl stín se vkradu tam

transpoem: "A thin stalk is your body\nfrom which grain fell without sprouting\nhow
  like a thin stalk is your body\n\nA skein of silk is your body\ndesire written on
  the tissues’s \nevery last wrinkling\nhow like a skein of silk is your body\n\nA
  burning sky is your body\nfurtively, a banshee with it, \nin the weaving\nhow like
  a burning sky is your body\n\nThe quiet is your body\nits cry sets my eyelids trembling\nhow
  like the quiet is your body\n\n<h1>Certitude</h1>\n\nI enter into love and while
  blinded\nfeel my way, stumbling into the dark past\nof your stricken mercies\n\nI
  ransack and, unexpectedly and already, I know\nit is not a given for me to stay
  in this paradise\nI have so longed and yet do not belong\n\nI pass though I renounce
  nothing\nwhile staring into your noble eyes\nthere, I steal into half death half
  shadow\n"

  <p>The poems here were chosen from the book <em>Krásné neštěstí</em> (<em>Beautiful Bad Luck</em> – or <em>Unhappiness</em>, depending on how you read it), which was first published in 2006 by one of Halas’s sons, a well-known radio presenter in the Czech Republic. The poems were published for the first time alongside the letters that Halas sent them in, to his wife, between the years 1928 and 1939. None of her correspondence is included in the volume.</p>
  <p>I chose both poems because they delighted and challenged me. The first thing I discovered is that making things rhyme in Czech is much easier than in English. I was only able to preserve the rhyme in “Whispered,” but since Halas was often accused of not being poetic enough, I figured he would not mind.</p>

  <p>František Halas was born in Moravia in 1901 (when it was still part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and died in 1949. He was an active member of the communist Czech resistance to the Nazis and wrote for the illegal communist newspaper, <em>Rudé Pravo</em>. When he died, he was a celebrated poet, an editor at Orbis Publishing House, and the head of the writers‘ union of the Ministry of Information. His poetry, however, was lyrical in nature, eventually leading to a falling out with the communist regime. He was not dialectic enough for communist tastes. During the Prague Spring of 1968, one of his sons, Ludvig Kundera (father of writer Milan Kundera), and others published a book that revived interest in Halas’s early lyric poetry.</p>
  <p>Milan Kundera puts Halas’s poems in the hands of the main character of the novel <em>The Joke</em> (<em>Žert</em>), which is how I was introduced to Halas. The protagonist wallows in the poems because he has been exiled for a bad joke. He uses them to seduce a girl, who is happier to hear them than she is with his physical advances. Halas’s poems are melodramatic and strange — my favorite kind of love poem.</p>
