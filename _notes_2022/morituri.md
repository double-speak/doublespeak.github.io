poem: "Sonne, Sterberin! \nDu heilige Sonne blutest \nUnd Deine Liebe strömt in Flammenpurpur
  Hin über den leuchtenden, \nAnbetung lispelnden See! \nSonne! - Menschenmutter!
  \n\nKüsse noch einmal dort in der ferne \nMeines Heissgeliebten klagenden Mund:
  Auch er ist Dein Sohn! \nEh die Segel tauchen in Dampf, \nEh die Wasser stehen \nUnd
  der Wald den düstern Mantel nimmt! \nSchönetrunken lächelt mir immer noch \nDein
  Heiligenantlitz, \nMenschenmutter! \nDu, die mich ausströmte ins lebende All, Dort
  in der ferne \nZittert ein wundes Freundesherz! \n\nO, gieb ihm jetzt \nIn Deinem
  letzten Glutenkusse \nNieverzagende Kraft, \nEwige Jugend! \nEh die Nacht das schwarze
  Laken breitet Und Orion Totenwache hält! \n"
transpoem: "Sun, dying one! \nYou, holy sun, bleed \nAnd thy love surges in flaming
  purple \nOver the shining, \nWorship-whispering sea! \nSun! - Mother of man! \n\nKiss
  once more there in the distance \nMy beloved’s plaintive mouth: \nHe, too, is thy
  son! \nEre the sails dip into fog, \nEre the waters stand still \nAnd the forest
  dons a dark cloak!\nSmiling to me still, drunk with beauty, \nYour holy face, \nMother
  of man! \nYou, who cast me into the living All, \nThere in the distance \nA friend’s
  tender heart trembles! \n\nO, give him now \nIn thy last glowing kiss \nUnwavering
  strength, \nEternal youth! \nEre the night spreads a black shroud \nAnd Orion keeps
  wake! \n"
note: "<p>“Morituri,” published by Brand in his magazine <em>Der Eigene</em> in 1898,
  is a homoerotic poem wherein the narrator begs the sun to provide love, strength,
  and youth to his lover. This is consistent with the glorification of health and
  strength, especially of the nude body, found in illustrations throughout <em>Der
  Eigene</em>, including the one accompanying the original poem. Of note here is that
  Brand and his colleagues often described homosexuality as <em>Liebe zwischen Freunden</em>,
  or “love between friends,” so the romance is implicit even without the mention of
  “beloved.” Given Brand’s open hostility towards religion, it is also interesting
  that the poem has a prayer-like quality, which I hoped to preserve in the translation.

abio: "<p>Adolf Brand (1874–1945) was a German gay activist and the founder of the
  first gay periodical, <em>Der Eigene</em> (1896–1932). He was also a founding member
  of Der Gemeinschaft der Eigenen (GdE), a literary society that viewed homosexuality
  as a basic human desire better expressed through art and literature than biology.
  As such, the GdE rejected Magnus Hirschfeld’s medical view of homosexuality, which
  associated it with femininity. GdE members fought unsuccessfully for the reform
  of Paragraph 175, which criminalized homosexuality in Germany. However, some of
  Brand’s more devastating views, including his support for pederasty, white supremacy,
  and misogyny, have rightfully caused the GdE to be discredited today. Beyond his
  literary activities, Brand was also known for outing prominent figures who expressed
  homophobic views, for which he was imprisoned at one point. Unfortunately, Brand
  was forced to abandon his activism in the 1930s due to harassment from Nazi authorities.</p>"
