translator: Maya Shumyatcher
poem: "1. \nМы легли у разбитой ели, \nЖдем, когда же начнет светлеть. \nПод шинелью
  вдвоем теплее \nНа продрогшей, гнилой земле. \n \n- Знаешь, Юлька, я против грусти,
  \nНо сегодня она не в счет. \nДома в яблочном захолустье \nМама, мамка моя живет.
  \n \nУ тебя есть друзья, любимый, \nУ меня лишь она одна. \nПахнет в хате квашней
  и дымом, \nЗа порогом бурлит весна. \n \nСтарой кажется: каждый кустик \nБеспокойную
  дочку ждет. \nЗнаешь, Юлька, я против грусти, \nНо сегодня она не в счет... \n \nОтогрелись
  мы еле-еле, \nВдруг нежданный приказ: \"Вперед!\" \nСнова рядом в сырой шинели \nСветлокосый
  солдат идет. \n \n2. \nС каждым днем становилось горше, \nШли без митингов и знамен.
  \nВ окруженье попал под Оршей \nНаш потрепанный батальон. \n \nЗинка нас повела
  в атаку, \nМы пробились по черной ржи, \nПо воронкам и буеракам, \nЧерез смертные
  рубежи. \n \nМы не ждали посмертной славы, \nМы хотели со славой жить. \n...Почему
  же в бинтах кровавых \nСветлокосый солдат лежит? \n \nЕе тело своей шинелью \nУкрывала
  я, зубы сжав.\nБелорусские ветры пели \nО рязанских глухих садах. \n \n3. \n- Знаешь,
  Зинка, я против грусти, \nНо сегодня она не в счет. \nГде-то в яблочном захолустье
  \nМама, мамка твоя живет. \n \nУ меня есть друзья, любимый, \nУ нее ты была одна.
  \nПахнет в хате квашней и дымом, \nЗа порогом бурлит весна. \n \nИ старушка в цветастом
  платье \nУ иконы свечу зажгла. \nЯ не знаю, как написать ей, \nЧтоб тебя она не
  ждала... \n"
transpoem: "1. \nBunking down near a splintered spruce tree        \nWaiting, hoping
  for dawn to break,                         \nIt is warmer to lay together                              \nOn
  damp soil in a cold rain’s wake.                                \n \n- You know,
  Julie, I’m not sentimental,                   \nBut no matter, I’ll say it still.
  \                          \nBack at home, in a house small and weathered, \nLives
  my ma among fields freshly tilled. \n \nYou have friends, a good man who loves you,
  \nShe is all that I have in this world. \nBread is baking, sweet smoke surrounds
  her \nOutside, spring is blossoming bold. \n \nSeems to her every sprig and tree
  branch \nSeeks her daughter’s return with a thrill. \nYou know, Julie, I’m not sentimental,
  \nBut no matter, I’ll say it still… \n \nWe warmed up a little, just barely \nThen
  sudden orders: “Advance!” \nAgain alongside me wearily \nWalks a soldier, her braids
  askance. \n \n2. \nEvery day things became more bitter, \nWe marched on without
  fanfare now \nUntil near the Orsha perimeter  \nOur battalion reached enemy grounds.
  \n \nZinka led us into the battle, \nBreaking through fields of rye and wheat, \nCrossing
  marshes and ditches gladly \nTempting death at each turn of fate. \n \nWe weren’t
  fighting for posthumous glory, \nWe fought, living our glory each day. \n…Why, wrapped
  in bloody bandages, \nDoes this blonde-braided soldier lay? \n \nClenching my jaw,
  I covered her  \nWith my overcoat, damp from the earth. \nBelarus’s cold winds were
  singing there \nOf her distant Ryazan home and hearth. \n \n3. \n- You know, Zinka,
  I’m not sentimental, \nBut no matter, I‘ll say it still. \nIn a faraway house small
  and weathered, \nLives your ma among fields freshly tilled. \n \nI have friends,
  a good man who loves me, \nShe had only you in this world. \nBread is baking, sweet
  smoke surrounds her \nOutside, spring is blossoming bold. \n \nAn old woman in flower-print
  housedress \nLights a prayer candle, hope holding true. \nI don’t know how best
  to write her  \nThat she should not keep waiting for you … \n"
note: "<p>\nAs with any translation, I tried to stick as close to the original as
  I could. What does that mean? Two elements of Drunina’s poetry were immediately
  apparent to me: the rhythmic, marching quality of the stanzas, so resonantly underlying
  the meaning of the words themselves, and a plain-spokenness that belies its profound
  emotionality and intelligence. I could feel Drunina herself in the writing and worked
  to preserve these elements above all.\n</p>\n<p>\nBesides staying true to the style,
  I had to balance the precision of the translation against the intangible imperative
  of conveying the feeling of the poem. So, while I went to painstaking lengths to
  translate verbatim, some phrases changed. For example, the phrase “яблочное захолустье,”
  which the poet coins to describe the location where Zinka’s mother lives, would
  translate literally to a somewhat nonsense “apple-ish backwoods” in English. To
  a Russophone, it evokes a sense of sweet, countryside nostalgia. What phrase would
  convey the sensation in English? I settled, after much debate, on the somewhat lexically
  removed “fields freshly tilled,” which also fit nicely with the rhythm and rhyme
  of the poem.\n<p/>\n<p>\n<p/>\n<p>\nIn another instance, “Пахнет в хате квашней
  и дымом” (“The house smells like levain and smoke”) became “Bread is baking, sweet
  smoke surrounds her.” I toyed with the more literal translation but, unlike <em>квашня</em>,
  which is a well-known term to the average Russian speaker, the English “levain”
  necessitates a dictionary for many (a well-read friend asked if I had mistyped “leaves”),
  and “sourdough starter” would wreck the poem’s precise rhythm. I settled on the
  version that best conveyed the plain-spoken power of the original. \n<p/>\n<p>\n<p/>\n<p>\nA
  detailed account of the decisions that went into each line of the translation could
  easily go on for another several pages, so I will simply wish you as enjoyable a
  time reading this poem as I had translating it.\n<p/>\n<p>\n<p/>\n<p>\n***\n<p/>\n<p>\n<p/>\n<p>\nI
  began translating this poem years ago, and it lived on the back burner until, early
  this winter, I decided to finally check off some projects from my personal to-do
  list. While the timing of the translation is entirely coincidental, given the poem’s
  topic and country of origin, it feels imprudent not to mention current events. Along
  with the rest of the world, including many Russian citizens, I have felt horrified
  at Russia’s unwarranted and unconscionable aggression in Ukraine. As “Zinka” reminds
  us, each life cut short is an immeasurable tragedy. I hope for a world in which
  peace prevails, civilians do not fear for their lives, and no mother must receive
  news of a child killed at war.\n<p/>"

  Veteran and poet Yulia (Julia) Drunina (1924-1991) began life in a Moscow communal apartment, the daughter of a teacher and a librarian. With the start of WWII, the teenage Drunina’s desperate attempts to participate in the war effort were eventually successful. She trained as a nurse and combat medic, saw three tours in combat and was severely injured twice, nearly dying when a shell fragment lodged itself millimeters from her carotid. Drunina was awarded the Order of the Red Star for her bravery.
  </p>
  <p>
  Afterwards, she would go on to graduate from Moscow’s Maxim Gorky Literature Institute and rise to immense popularity as a poet. Anthologies of her work have been regularly published from the 1940s until the present day. Unsurprisingly, the scars of her war experience would forever figure heavily in her work, both in content and style. “Zinka,” the poet’s conversation with a fallen friend, touches on the unique situation of being a woman in combat and, most importantly, reminds us of the human toll of war.
  <p/>
  <p>
  Honest, uncompromising, deeply emotional—much like the poet herself—Drunina’s poetry is in a class of its own. Despite her acclaim domestically, Drunina’s work is fairly unknown abroad.
