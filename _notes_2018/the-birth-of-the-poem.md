title: O Nascimento do poema
transtitle: The Birth of the Poem
author: Adélia Prado
translator: Ellen Doré Watson
poem: "O que existe são coisas,\r\nnão palavras. Por isso\r\nte ouvirei sem cansaço
  recitar em búlgaro\r\ncomo olharei montanhas durante horas,\r\nou nuvens.\r\nSinais
  valem palavras,\r\npalavras valem coisas,\r\ncoisas não valem nada.\r\nEntender
  é um rapto,\r\né o mesmo que desentender.\r\nMinha mãe morrendo,\r\nnão faltou a
  meu choro este arco-íris:\r\no luto irá bem com meus cabelos claros.\r\nGranito,
  lápide, crepe,\r\nsão belas coisas ou palavras belas?\r\nMármore, sol, lixívia.\r\nEntender
  me seqüestra de palavra e de coisa,\r\narremessa-me ao curacao da poesia.\r\nPor
  isso escrevo os poemas\r\npra velar o que ameaça minha fraqueza mortal.\r\nRecuso-me
  a acreditar que homens inventam as línguas,\r\né o Espírito quem me impele,\r\nquer
  sera adorado\r\ne sopra no meu ouvido este hino litúrgico:\r\nbaldes, vassouras,
  dívidas e medo,\r\ndesejo de ver Jonathan e ser condenada ao inferno.\r\nNão construí
  as pirâmides. Sou Deus.\r\n"
transpoem: "What exists are things,\r\nnot words. That’s why\r\nI’ll tirelessly listen
  as you recite poems in Bulgarian\r\njust as I’ll spend hours staring at mountains\r\nor
  clouds. \r\nSigns stand for words, \r\nwords stand for things,\r\nthings stand for
  nothing. \r\nUnderstanding comes like rapture,\r\nit’s the same as not understanding.
  \r\nWhen my mother lay dying, even my weeping\r\ncontained a rainbow:\r\nblack will
  highlight my fair hair. \r\nGranite, gravestone, crepe —\r\nbeautiful things or
  beautiful words? \r\nMarble, sun, cellar door. \r\nUnderstanding steals me away
  from words and things \r\nand flings me into the heart of poetry. \r\nThat’s why
  I write poems,\r\nto hide what threatens my fatal weakness. \r\nI refuse to believe
  that people invented languages, \r\nit’s the Spirit driving me, \r\nwanting to be
  adored. \r\nHe whispers this hymn in my ear:\r\nbuckets, brooms, debts, and fear,
  \r\nthe desire to see Jonathan and be condemned to hell. \r\nI don’t build the pyramids.
  I am God. \r\n"
