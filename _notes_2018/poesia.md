  I

  Io sono una lampada ch’arda
              soave!
  la lampada, forse, che guarda
  pendendo alla fumida trave,
              la veglia che fila;

  e ascolta novelle e ragioni
              da bocche
  celate nell’ombra, ai cantoni,
  là dietro le soffici rócche
              che albeggiano in fila:

  ragioni, novelle, e saluti
  d’amore, all’orecchio, confusi:
  gli assidui bisbigli perduti
  nel sibilo assiduo dei fusi;
  le vecchie parole sentite
  da presso con palpiti nuovi,
  tra il sordo rimastico mite
              dei bovi:

  II

  la lampada, forse, che a cena
              raduna;
  che sboccia sul bianco, e serena
  su l’ampia tovaglia sta, luna
              su prato di neve;

  e arride al giocondo convito;
              poi cenna,
  d’un tratto, ad un piccolo dito,
  là, nero tuttor della penna
              che corre e che beve:

  ma lascia nell’ombra, alla mensa,
  la madre, nel tempo ch’esplora
  la figlia più grande che pensa
  guardando il mio raggio d’aurora:
  rapita nell’aurea mia fiamma
  non sente lo sguardo tuo vano;
  già fugge, è già, povera mamma,
              lontano!

  III

  Se già non la lampada io sia,
              che oscilla
  davanti una dolce Maria,
  vivendo dell’umile stilla
              di cento capanne:

  raccolgo l’uguale tributo
              d’ulivo
  da tutta la villa, e il saluto
  del colle sassoso e del rivo
              sonante di canne:

  e incende, il mio raggío, di sera,
  tra l’ombra di mesta viola,
  nel ciglio che prega e dispera,
  la povera lagrima sola;
  e muore, nei lucidi albori,
  tremando, il mio pallido raggio,
  tra cori di vergini e fiori
              di maggio:

  IV

  o quella, velata, che al fianco
              t’addita
  la donna più bianca del bianco
  lenzuolo, che in grembo, assopita,
              matura il tuo seme;

  o quella che irraggia una cuna
              — la barca
  che, alzando il fanal di fortuna,
  nel mare dell’essere varca,
              si dondola, e geme —;

  o quella che illumina tacita
  tombe profonde — con visi
  scarniti di vecchi; tenaci
  di vergini bionde sorrisi;
  tua madre!… nell’ombra senz’ore,
  per te, dal suo triste riposo,
  congiunge le mani al suo cuore
              già ròso! —.

  V

  Io sono la lampada ch’arde
              soave!
  nell’ore più sole e più tarde,
  nell’ombra più mesta, più grave,
              più buona, o fratello!

  Ch’io penda sul capo a fanciulla
              che pensa,
  su madre che prega, su culla
  che piange, su garrula mensa,
              su tacito avello;

  lontano risplende l’ardore
  mio casto all’errante che trita
  notturno, piangendo nel cuore,
  la pallida via della vita:
  s’arresta; ma vede il mio raggio,
  che gli arde nell’anima blando:
  riprende l’oscuro viaggio
              cantando.
transpoem: "I\n\nMay the lamp of me shine\n            and soothe!\nthis lamp as it
  looks\nfrom a smoke-wrapped beam,\nperhaps, at the night, the weavers;\nthis lamp
  culling news, thoughts,\n            from mouths\ndarkened by the darkness,\nthere,
  across the soft cliffs’\n            long dawning line:\nthoughts, news, and love
  wishes, \ntoo soft to grasp:\nthe assiduous whispers lost\nin the spindle’s assiduous
  hiss;\nthe words, worn out, felt\nnear, with such beat, new,\namid the oxen’s dull\n
  \           thudding chew:\n\n\nII\n\nthe lamp that perhaps, gathers\n            to
  dinner;\nand blooms on the white, spreading\ncalm on the wide cloth, moon\non a
  meadow of snow,\n            and smiles on the gathered smiles;\n                        then
  suddenly gestures\nto a finger so small\nthere, guiding the pen\nthat runs and drinks:\nbut
  leaves in the gloom, at the table,\nthe mother, who is still and stares\nat her
  elder daughter, there, pensively\nlooking toward my sunrise,\nrapt in my golden
  flame,\nyour stare is lost to her, far;\n            she is gone already, poor mother,\n
  \                       far!\n\nIII\n\nPerhaps I am the lamp,\n            flickering\nby
  a statue of Mary,\nI live on one hundred shacks\nfeeding me humble oil drips:\nI
  harvest this tribute of olive, all equal,\nfrom the village, the greeting\nof the
  rocky hill, of the creek\nresounding with reeds:\nat dusk my ray sets fire,\nin
  the violets’ shadows so bleak,\nto that poor, single tear\non eyelashes praying
  and despairing;\nand dies in the crystal of dawn\nmy pale, quivering ray,\namong
  virgins’ choirs and flowers\n            of May:\n\nIV\n\nOr that, shaded,\n            points\nto
  the woman paler than the pale\nsheet, dozing, whose womb\nripens your seed;\nor
  illumines a bow\n— the boat\nwhich lifting the headlight of luck\ncrosses the wide
  stream of being,\nand wobbles and groans —;\nor silently glows\non deep tombs —
  on faces\nolder and gaunt; on firm\nvirgins’ smiles;\nyour mother! …in that timeless
  shade,\nfrom her gloomy rest,\nshe prays for you, heart gnawed, hands tight\n            on
  her chest\n\nV\n\nIt shines, my lamp,\n            it soothes!\nin the loneliest,
  latest of hours,\nin the shade, the gloomiest, the heaviest ,\nthe kindest, oh brother!\nI
  hang over the pensive\nyoung woman,\nand the devout mother, over the crying\ncradle,
  over the table so merry,\nover the gravestone so grave;\nfrom distances shines my
  chaste\nflame to the wanderer roaming\nthe dark, with his heart so heavy,\non life’s
  moonlit trail:\nhe stops; then he sees my ray\nthat quietly burns in his soul:\nhe
  steps back on the darkest of paths,\n            he sings as he strolls.\n"

  <p>“Pascoli counts on a reader that does not know all the words he uses. As …[Pascoli]… says … poetry, like religion, needs ‘words that veil and darken their meaning, words, I mean, foreign to present use (and which are nevertheless used to “give greater life to thought”).’” — Giorgio Agamben (1982)</p>

  <p>“Life is cold and we need heat; life is dark and we need light; we shall not let fade what can give us light and heat; a single spark can awake flames and joy. We shall not let death take whatever has been beautiful and gay.” — Giovanni Pascoli (1898)</p>

  <p>This piece by Giovanni Pascoli is meant as a statement of intent, a manifesto of the intimist universalism which is the hallmark of the poet from Emilia. The poem’s protagonist is poetry personified, presenting itself in the form of a lamp spreading a warm, soothing light. This light, over the five stanzas, portrays a series of seven canvasses; the first three in great detail, the second three with quicker brushstrokes, and the last with a more abstract, rarefied touch.</p>

  <p>At first, the lamp hangs almost unseen in the living room of a smoky farm. In the dim circle of light, a mother and her daughters are spending the early night weaving. The daughters are talking about love. Then, the lamp spreads its light on a table set for dinner, where a kid, the elder daughter, and the mother stand in isolation against the merry background. The light, though still soft, is more vital: it points to the kid, who is focused on writing; it captures the eyes of the elder daughter, who is there daydreaming and ignoring her mother’s inquisitive stare. Then, it is a votive lamp inside a Marian shrine, burning peasants’ offers of olive oil and witnessing these people’s faith, private and public — the “poor single tear” and the “virgins’ choirs.” Then it gets quicker: it is the lamp on the bedside table of a pregnant woman; it is the headlight of a ship crossing “the wide stream of being”; it is dead candles in a graveyard. Finally, there is no lamp, only light. This light is free from its many possible sources, and it can reach and comfort a wanderer roaming in “the loneliest, latest of hours.”</p>


  <p>The poem portrays a coming to life, an actualization of poetry. It does so through a succession of van Gogh-like pictures, which I feel is more significant to the understanding of the poem than the actual stanzas’ structure. Indeed, the narration evolves through changing tenses and adverbs, which always coincide with changes in the landscape in which the poetic light spreads. The narrating voice starts introducing the smoky room with a wishful and timid tone — “May the lamp of me shine,” which renders the Italian “Io sono la lampada <em>ch’arda</em>”; then, switching to the table scene, the voice switches to a present tense and an adverb of probability — “perhaps…gathers”; adverbs of probability are dropped when the Marian shrine is populated by the villagers — “I harvest this tribute of olive…at dusk my ray sets fire”; this pure present is kept and stressed at the beginning of each of the three successive scenes — “It shines, my lamp / it soothes!’’ which renders the Italian “Io sono la lampada <em>ch’arde</em>” with the woman, the boat, and the graveyard; finally, the first stroke of the last canvas exclaims — “It shines, my lamp / it soothes!’’ which renders the Italian “Io sono la lampada <em>ch’arde</em> / soave!”</p>

  <p>The decision to focus on the flow of images informed my choices in translation. In order not to break this flow, I often either adopted non-literal solutions, or I chose options more prosaic than the original. For example, “la veglia che fila” in the fourth verse describes weavers who are awake (keeping vigil) at night and spinning. These are encompassed by the lamp’s light, and the lamp looks at them, not at the night; though, directly introducing night and weavers allowed me to synthetically fix the image of the half-shaded room. Or, at the beginning of the shrine’s canvas, I was more explicit than the original in describing the “tribute of olive,” since the idea of an olive-oil lamp is quite remote to our present experience and the original passing mention would have complicated a passage which, to the best of my understanding, was not meant to be obscure. On the other hand, I tried to stay as close as possible to the original in matters of sound and structure, and I thus preserved the rhyme scheme at the end of each stanza.</p>

  <p>I have always been driven to Pascoli’s work by his struggle to remember what’s gone, to strengthen what’s close and frail, to fight a battle to save “temples that the Gods shall not save” (Borges). I’m happy to present to you “Poesia” as a sample of how Pascoli framed this effort as a hopeful and humble task. Before doing so, I want to thank Professor Taije Silverman, who reviewed my early drafts, and whose advice has been incredibly insightful and helpful in the process of translation.</p>
