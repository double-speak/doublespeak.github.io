poem: "I\r\n\r\nIo sono una lampada ch’arda\r\n            soave!\r\nla lampada, forse,
  che guarda\r\npendendo alla fumida trave,\r\n            la veglia che fila;\r\n\r\ne
  ascolta novelle e ragioni\r\n            da bocche\r\ncelate nell’ombra, ai cantoni,\r\nlà
  dietro le soffici rócche\r\n            che albeggiano in fila:\r\n\r\nragioni,
  novelle, e saluti\r\nd’amore, all’orecchio, confusi:\r\ngli assidui bisbigli perduti\r\nnel
  sibilo assiduo dei fusi;\r\nle vecchie parole sentite\r\nda presso con palpiti nuovi,\r\ntra
  il sordo rimastico mite\r\n            dei bovi:\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nla lampada, forse,
  che a cena\r\n            raduna;\r\nche sboccia sul bianco, e serena\r\nsu l’ampia
  tovaglia sta, luna\r\n            su prato di neve;\r\n\r\ne arride al giocondo
  convito;\r\n            poi cenna,\r\nd’un tratto, ad un piccolo dito,\r\nlà, nero
  tuttor della penna\r\n            che corre e che beve:\r\n\r\nma lascia nell’ombra,
  alla mensa,\r\nla madre, nel tempo ch’esplora\r\nla figlia più grande che pensa\r\nguardando
  il mio raggio d’aurora:\r\nrapita nell’aurea mia fiamma\r\nnon sente lo sguardo
  tuo vano;\r\ngià fugge, è già, povera mamma,\r\n            lontano!\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSe
  già non la lampada io sia,\r\n            che oscilla\r\ndavanti una dolce Maria,\r\nvivendo
  dell’umile stilla\r\n            di cento capanne:\r\n\r\nraccolgo l’uguale tributo\r\n
  \           d’ulivo\r\nda tutta la villa, e il saluto\r\ndel colle sassoso e del
  rivo\r\n            sonante di canne:\r\n\r\ne incende, il mio raggío, di sera,\r\ntra
  l’ombra di mesta viola,\r\nnel ciglio che prega e dispera,\r\nla povera lagrima
  sola;\r\ne muore, nei lucidi albori,\r\ntremando, il mio pallido raggio,\r\ntra
  cori di vergini e fiori\r\n            di maggio:\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\no quella, velata,
  che al fianco\r\n            t’addita\r\nla donna più bianca del bianco\r\nlenzuolo,
  che in grembo, assopita,\r\n            matura il tuo seme;\r\n\r\no quella che
  irraggia una cuna\r\n            — la barca\r\nche, alzando il fanal di fortuna,\r\nnel
  mare dell’essere varca,\r\n            si dondola, e geme —;\r\n\r\no quella che
  illumina tacita\r\ntombe profonde — con visi\r\nscarniti di vecchi; tenaci\r\ndi
  vergini bionde sorrisi;\r\ntua madre!… nell’ombra senz’ore,\r\nper te, dal suo triste
  riposo,\r\ncongiunge le mani al suo cuore\r\n            già ròso! —.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIo
  sono la lampada ch’arde\r\n            soave!\r\nnell’ore più sole e più tarde,\r\nnell’ombra
  più mesta, più grave,\r\n            più buona, o fratello!\r\n\r\nCh’io penda sul
  capo a fanciulla\r\n            che pensa,\r\nsu madre che prega, su culla\r\nche
  piange, su garrula mensa,\r\n            su tacito avello;\r\n\r\nlontano risplende
  l’ardore\r\nmio casto all’errante che trita\r\nnotturno, piangendo nel cuore,\r\nla
  pallida via della vita:\r\ns’arresta; ma vede il mio raggio,\r\nche gli arde nell’anima
  blando:\r\nriprende l’oscuro viaggio\r\n            cantando.\r\n"
transpoem: "I\r\n\r\nMay the lamp of me shine\r\n            and soothe!\r\nthis lamp
  as it looks\r\nfrom a smoke-wrapped beam,\r\nperhaps, at the night, the weavers;\r\nthis
  lamp culling news, thoughts,\r\n            from mouths\r\ndarkened by the darkness,\r\nthere,
  across the soft cliffs’\r\n            long dawning line:\r\nthoughts, news, and
  love wishes, \r\ntoo soft to grasp:\r\nthe assiduous whispers lost\r\nin the spindle’s
  assiduous hiss;\r\nthe words, worn out, felt\r\nnear, with such beat, new,\r\namid
  the oxen’s dull\r\n            thudding chew:\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nthe lamp that
  perhaps, gathers\r\n            to dinner;\r\nand blooms on the white, spreading\r\ncalm
  on the wide cloth, moon\r\non a meadow of snow,\r\n            and smiles on the
  gathered smiles;\r\n                        then suddenly gestures\r\nto a finger
  so small\r\nthere, guiding the pen\r\nthat runs and drinks:\r\nbut leaves in the
  gloom, at the table,\r\nthe mother, who is still and stares\r\nat her elder daughter,
  there, pensively\r\nlooking toward my sunrise,\r\nrapt in my golden flame,\r\nyour
  stare is lost to her, far;\r\n            she is gone already, poor mother,\r\n
  \                       far!\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am the lamp,\r\n            flickering\r\nby
  a statue of Mary,\r\nI live on one hundred shacks\r\nfeeding me humble oil drips:\r\nI
  harvest this tribute of olive, all equal,\r\nfrom the village, the greeting\r\nof
  the rocky hill, of the creek\r\nresounding with reeds:\r\nat dusk my ray sets fire,\r\nin
  the violets’ shadows so bleak,\r\nto that poor, single tear\r\non eyelashes praying
  and despairing;\r\nand dies in the crystal of dawn\r\nmy pale, quivering ray,\r\namong
  virgins’ choirs and flowers\r\n            of May:\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOr that, shaded,\r\n
  \           points\r\nto the woman paler than the pale\r\nsheet, dozing, whose womb\r\nripens
  your seed;\r\nor illumines a bow\r\n— the boat\r\nwhich lifting the headlight of
  luck\r\ncrosses the wide stream of being,\r\nand wobbles and groans —;\r\nor silently
  glows\r\non deep tombs — on faces\r\nolder and gaunt; on firm\r\nvirgins’ smiles;\r\nyour
  mother! …in that timeless shade,\r\nfrom her gloomy rest,\r\nshe prays for you,
  heart gnawed, hands tight\r\n            on her chest\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIt shines,
  my lamp,\r\n            it soothes!\r\nin the loneliest, latest of hours,\r\nin
  the shade, the gloomiest, the heaviest ,\r\nthe kindest, oh brother!\r\nI hang over
  the pensive\r\nyoung woman,\r\nand the devout mother, over the crying\r\ncradle,
  over the table so merry,\r\nover the gravestone so grave;\r\nfrom distances shines
  my chaste\r\nflame to the wanderer roaming\r\nthe dark, with his heart so heavy,\r\non
  life’s moonlit trail:\r\nhe stops; then he sees my ray\r\nthat quietly burns in
  his soul:\r\nhe steps back on the darkest of paths,\r\n            he sings as he
  strolls.\r\n"
note: "<p>“Pascoli counts on a reader that does not know all the words he uses. As
  …[Pascoli]… says … poetry, like religion, needs ‘words that veil and darken their
  meaning, words, I mean, foreign to present use (and which are nevertheless used
  to “give greater life to thought”).’” — Giorgio Agamben (1982)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Life
  is cold and we need heat; life is dark and we need light; we shall not let fade
  what can give us light and heat; a single spark can awake flames and joy. We shall
  not let death take whatever has been beautiful and gay.” — Giovanni Pascoli (1898)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This
  piece by Giovanni Pascoli is meant as a statement of intent, a manifesto of the
  intimist universalism which is the hallmark of the poet from Emilia. The poem’s
  protagonist is poetry personified, presenting itself in the form of a lamp spreading
  a warm, soothing light. This light, over the five stanzas, portrays a series of
  seven canvasses; the first three in great detail, the second three with quicker
  brushstrokes, and the last with a more abstract, rarefied touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At
  first, the lamp hangs almost unseen in the living room of a smoky farm. In the dim
  circle of light, a mother and her daughters are spending the early night weaving.
  The daughters are talking about love. Then, the lamp spreads its light on a table
  set for dinner, where a kid, the elder daughter, and the mother stand in isolation
  against the merry background. The light, though still soft, is more vital: it points
  to the kid, who is focused on writing; it captures the eyes of the elder daughter,
  who is there daydreaming and ignoring her mother’s inquisitive stare. Then, it is
  a votive lamp inside a Marian shrine, burning peasants’ offers of olive oil and
  witnessing these people’s faith, private and public — the “poor single tear” and
  the “virgins’ choirs.” Then it gets quicker: it is the lamp on the bedside table
  of a pregnant woman; it is the headlight of a ship crossing “the wide stream of
  being”; it is dead candles in a graveyard. Finally, there is no lamp, only light.
  This light is free from its many possible sources, and it can reach and comfort
  a wanderer roaming in “the loneliest, latest of hours.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The poem
  portrays a coming to life, an actualization of poetry. It does so through a succession
  of van Gogh-like pictures, which I feel is more significant to the understanding
  of the poem than the actual stanzas’ structure. Indeed, the narration evolves through
  changing tenses and adverbs, which always coincide with changes in the landscape
  in which the poetic light spreads. The narrating voice starts introducing the smoky
  room with a wishful and timid tone — “May the lamp of me shine,” which renders the
  Italian “Io sono la lampada <em>ch’arda</em>”; then, switching to the table scene,
  the voice switches to a present tense and an adverb of probability — “perhaps…gathers”;
  adverbs of probability are dropped when the Marian shrine is populated by the villagers
  — “I harvest this tribute of olive…at dusk my ray sets fire”; this pure present
  is kept and stressed at the beginning of each of the three successive scenes — “It
  shines, my lamp / it soothes!’’ which renders the Italian “Io sono la lampada <em>ch’arde</em>”
  with the woman, the boat, and the graveyard; finally, the first stroke of the last
  canvas exclaims — “It shines, my lamp / it soothes!’’ which renders the Italian
  “Io sono la lampada <em>ch’arde</em> / soave!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision to focus
  on the flow of images informed my choices in translation. In order not to break
  this flow, I often either adopted non-literal solutions, or I chose options more
  prosaic than the original. For example, “la veglia che fila” in the fourth verse
  describes weavers who are awake (keeping vigil) at night and spinning. These are
  encompassed by the lamp’s light, and the lamp looks at them, not at the night; though,
  directly introducing night and weavers allowed me to synthetically fix the image
  of the half-shaded room. Or, at the beginning of the shrine’s canvas, I was more
  explicit than the original in describing the “tribute of olive,” since the idea
  of an olive-oil lamp is quite remote to our present experience and the original
  passing mention would have complicated a passage which, to the best of my understanding,
  was not meant to be obscure. On the other hand, I tried to stay as close as possible
  to the original in matters of sound and structure, and I thus preserved the rhyme
  scheme at the end of each stanza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have always been driven to Pascoli’s
  work by his struggle to remember what’s gone, to strengthen what’s close and frail,
  to fight a battle to save “temples that the Gods shall not save” (Borges). I’m happy
  to present to you “Poesia” as a sample of how Pascoli framed this effort as a hopeful
  and humble task. Before doing so, I want to thank Professor Taije Silverman, who
  reviewed my early drafts, and whose advice has been incredibly insightful and helpful
  in the process of translation.</p>\r\n"
tbio: "<p>I am an Italian PhD student in economics. I have studied t at Rome, Turin,
  and now here at the University of Pennsylvania. My work mostly focuses on how the
  real and banking/financial sectors interact. Having always been convinced that excessive
  specialization is boring, I try my best to also put some effort in literature and
  political thought. In these fields I am just an happy amateur and an avid reader.</p>\r\n"
