transtitle: In the Pyre of War
author: Hannah Szenes
translator: Jacob Hershman
poem: "בִּמְדוּרוֹת מִלְחָמָה, בִּדְלֵקָהִּ, בִּשְרֵפָה,\nבֵּין יַמִּים סוֹעֲרִים
  שֶׁל הַדָּם,\nהִנְנִי מַבְעִירָה פַּנָּסִי הַקָּטָן,\nלְחַפֵּשׂ, לְחַפֵּשׂ בֶּן-אָדָם.\n
  \nשַׁלְהֲבוֹת הַשְּׂרֵפָה מַדְעִיכוֹת פַּנָּסִי,\nאוֹר הָאֵשׁ מְסַנְוֵר אֶת עֵינַי;\nאֵיךְ
  אַבִּיט, אֵיךְ אֶרְאֶה, אֵיךְ אֵדַע, אֵיךְ אַכִּיר,\nכְּשֶׁהוּא יַעֲמֹד לְפָנַי?\n
  \nתֵּן סִימָן, אֱלֹהִים, תֵּן סִימָן עַל מִצְחוֹ,\nכִּי בָּאֵשׁ, בַּדְלֵקָה וּבַדָּם,\nכֵן
  אַכִּיר אֶת הַזִּיק הַטָּהוֹר, הַנִּצְחִי,\nאֶת אֲשֶׁר חִפַּשְׂתִּיו:  בֶּן-אָדָם.\n"
transpoem: "In the fire, explosions, the pyre of war. \nBetween days that are stormy
  with blood,\nI am burning my little lamp, casting the light,\nand I search, and
  I search for someone.\n\nThe blaze darkens the glow of my little lamp’s flame,\nit
  is so bright that I cannot see; \nwill I realize, gaze forth, will I know, ascertain
  \nwhen he finally stands before me?\n\nGive a sign, Blessed God, on his forehead
  a sign,\nfor in fire, in explosions and blood,\nI will see the pure spark, see the
  infinite spark, \nand find what I have searched for: someone."

  <p>In the original Hebrew, there are twelve syllables in the first and third lines of each four-line stanza. These lines are not rhymed. The second and fourth lines contain nine syllables and are rhymed. The poem as a whole follows a tribrachic meter, meaning each line comprises an assortment of three short, unstressed syllables.</p>
  <p>I was able to recreate the syllabic makeup of each stanza, as well as the rhyme scheme. To do this successfully, I had to make a few sacrifices. For instance, notwithstanding the primacy of syllabic triplets in <span lang="he">במדורות מלחמה</span>, I could not incorporate tribrachic meter into this translation. I found it impossible to both rhyme the second and fourth lines and translate into the original meter without totally transforming the diction. I ought to mention that, strictly speaking, there is no rhyme in the first and final stanzas, merely an assonance between “blood” and “someone.” Given, first, my ultimate objective of representing the essence of the original piece, second, the parameters of my translation and, third, the exact rhyme in the second stanza, I believe my readers will be able to infer that the original Hebrew bears a rhyme.</p>

  <p>Like many European Jews in the early twentieth century, Hannah Szenes was captivated by the prospect of establishing a Jewish homeland. As a teenager in Budapest, she joined local Zionist youth movements, eventually emigrating to Palestine in 1939 at the age of seventeen. For two years she lived in an agricultural cooperative (in Hebrew, <em>moshav</em>) in Nahalal. It was here that she composed, among other works, “In the Pyre of War.” In 1941, she relocated to a <em>kibbutz</em> in Caesarea.</p>
  <p>In 1943 Szenes joined a Zionist paramilitary organization called the Palmach as a volunteer. A year later, she joined the organization’s paratrooper unit, and, in 1944, was dropped into Yugoslavia to aid anti-Nazi forces. Only hours after entering Hungary, which was the central objective of the mission, Szenes and her compatriots were captured and imprisoned. Although Szenes was tortured for months, she never capitulated to her captors. In late November 1944, she was offered the choice to petition for clemency or face the firing squad. She did not want to beg for her life; she chose to die. Szenes faced her executioners without a blindfold. She was twenty-three.</p>
