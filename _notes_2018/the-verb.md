title: El verbo
transtitle: The Verb
author: Mario Benedetti
translator: Ella Konefal
poem: "En el principio era el verbo\r\ny el verbo no era dios\r\neran las palabras\r\nfrágiles
  transparentes y putas \r\ncada una venía con su estuche \r\ncon su legado de desidia\r\nera
  posible mirarlas al trasluz\r\no volverlas cabeza abajo\r\ninterrogarlas en calma
  o en francés\r\nellas respondían con guiños cómplices y corruptos \r\nqué suerte
  unos pocos estábamos en la pomada \r\néramos el resumen la quintaesencia el zumo\r\nellas
  las contraseñas nos valseaban el orgasmo \r\nabanicaban nuestra modesta vanidad\r\nmientras
  el pueblo ese desconocido\r\ncon calvaria tristeza decía no entendernos\r\nno saber
  de qué hablábamos ni de qué callábamos \r\nhasta nuestros silencios le resultaban
  complicados \r\nporque también integraban la partitura excelsa \r\nellas las palabras
  se ubicaban y reubicaban\r\neran nuestra vanguardia y cuando alguna caía \r\nacribillada
  por la moda o el sentido común \r\nlas otras se juntaban solidarias y espléndidas
  \r\ncada derrota las ponía radiantes\r\nporque como sostienen los latinoamericanos
  del boul mich \r\nla gran literatura sólo se produce en la infelicidad\r\ny solidarias
  y espléndidas parían\r\nadjectivos y gerundios\r\npreposiciones y delirios\r\ncon
  los cuales decorar el retortijón existencial \r\ny convertirlo en oda o nouvelle
  o manifesto\r\nlas revoluciones frustradas tienen eso de bueno \r\nprovocan anguistias
  de un gran nivel artístico \r\nen tanto las triunfantes apenas si alcanzan \r\nlogros
  tan prosaicos como la justicia social\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\nen el despúes será el verbo\r\ny
  el verbo tampoco será dios\r\ntan sólo el grito de varios millones de gargantas\r\ncapaces
  de reír y llorar como hombres nuevos y mujeres\r\nnuevas\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\ny las
  palabras putas y frágiles\r\nse volverán sólidas y artesanas\r\ny acaso ganen su
  derecho a ser sembradas\r\na ser regadas por los hechos y las lluvias\r\na abrirse
  en árboles y frutos\r\na ser por fin alimento y trofeo\r\nde un pueblo ya maduro
  por la revolución y la inocencia."
transpoem: "In the beginning there was the verb \r\nand the verb was not god\r\nthere
  were words\r\nfragile transparent and fucked\r\neach came in its wrappings\r\nwith
  legacies of indolence\r\nyou could hold them to the light\r\nor turn them upside
  down\r\ninterrogate them calmly or in french\r\nthey’d toss back putrid cunning
  winks\r\na lucky few were in the know\r\nwe were the digest the quintessential the
  juice\r\nthey were the passwords that swayed us to orgasm \r\ntaunted our sheepish
  vanity\r\nwhile that town of strangers\r\nwith tortured sorrow said they couldn’t
  fathom\r\nwhat we might be speaking of or what was left unspoken \r\nand even our
  silences rang twisted\r\nsince they too would play that sublime score\r\nthose words
  that settled and resettled\r\nthey were our vanguard and when one fell\r\nstruck
  down by fashion or by common sense\r\nthe others rose together in splendid solidarity\r\neach
  defeat would feed their radiance\r\nbecause like the latinos on boul mich will prophesize
  \r\ngreat literature comes only from unhappiness\r\nand in splendid solidarity they
  birthed\r\nadjectives and gerunds\r\nprepositions and deliriums\r\nwith which to
  decorate the existential contraction\r\nand turn it into ode or nouvelle or manifesto\r\nthese
  stymied revolutions have that going\r\ninciting angst of artistic proportions\r\nwhile
  triumphs rarely even reach for\r\nsuch banal achievements as social justice\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\nin
  the end will be the verb\r\nand the verb will not be god\r\nonly the shout of some
  assorted million throats \r\nfree to laugh and cry like men and women\r\nnew\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\nand
  the fucked and fragile words\r\nwill grow into artisanal stability\r\nand maybe
  win their right to planting\r\nto be drenched in facts and floodings\r\nto bloom
  as trees and fruits\r\nto at last give sustenance and trophy\r\nto a people overripe
  for revolution and for innocence. "
note: "<p>I was drawn to translate Benedetti’s work from Spanish into English for
  much the same reason, I think, as Benedetti was drawn to translate the world from
  experience into poetry. Which is to say, not because I immediately loved it or found
  it beautiful, but rather because it confused and overwhelmed me, and I wanted to
  figure it out. Benedetti’s work is chaotic, wordy, both straightforward and cacophonous.
  There are too many simultaneous truths, there is too much death for life to hold,
  there are too many words, and the words can’t hold the death, either. I wanted to
  translate “El verbo” almost as a coping mechanism, some way to methodically and
  concretely process a mess that resists detangling.</p>\r\n<p>Benedetti writes in
  a conversational tone, no flourishes: “This people is overripe for revolution and
  for innocence.” “The verb will not be god.” <em>The world is a mess and words are
  failing us. I will throw them at you in a fluid stream and hope that something sticks.</em>
  Somehow this head-on confrontation of injustices, for all its matter-of-fact-ness,
  can’t make sense of the mess. To me, understanding Benedetti’s poetic translations
  of experience means understanding that words can’t make sense of unfathomable horror,
  be they fragments or sentences or Spanish or English. The world is not right; Benedetti
  searches frantically within and between and underneath words, grasping at some sense
  of understanding. Whether he achieves it is another question. Whether I achieve
  it by puzzling through his puzzling is also another question. Reading and translating
  Benedetti requires rigorous dialogue between how the world is and how it ought to
  be. Whether we get to the bottom of this or not, that dialogue is a good place to
  start.</p>"
abio: "<p>Mario Benedetti (1920–2009) came of age and died in Montevideo, Uruguay,
  the country’s coastal capital that serves as a backdrop for much of Benedetti’s
  poetry. Part of the Generación del ’45, he was and is one of the most widely read
  poets in Latin America, revered for his seamless interweaving of love and politics
  and best-known for his short stories. In his youth he worked as a car mechanic,
  typist, secretary, journalist, and translator of Kafka from German into Spanish.
  \ Benedetti was a vocal figure in left-wing political organizing in Uruguay. He
  was passionate and active in shaping domestic politics, championing revolutions
  in Puerto Rico and Cuba, and criticizing US political and economic involvement in
  Latin American dictatorships. The poet also wrote plays and novels and was heavily
  involved in journalism. He founded and led a leftist magazine called <em>Marcha</em>,
  which was shut down when Benedetti was forced into exile during the country’s 1973
  military coup. He moved first to Buenos Aires, but fled to Cuba, Peru, and finally
  Spain following threats from Argentina’s right-wing military regime. He returned
  to Uruguay after twelve years of exile and split his time between Montevideo and
  Madrid until his death at eighty-eight.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Ella Konefal is a Penn junior studying fine arts and comparative literature.
  She cares deeply about voice, in all its many varied manifestations. She’s fluent
  in English, Spanish, and drawing, and getting there with Italian, French, and audiovisual
  composition. She’s grown up with a frequently shifting sense of home, having lived
  with her family of five in New York, Pennsylvania, Guatemala, Mexico, Ecuador, and
  Virginia. She’s happy to add a cozy third-floor apartment in West Philly to the
  list. The translation of poetry is a new pursuit, and she hopes you enjoy the final
  products as much as she enjoyed their formation.</p>"
