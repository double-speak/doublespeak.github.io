translator: Vivian Yuxin Wen
poem: "我是你河边上破旧的老水车，\r\n数百年来纺着疲惫的歌；\r\n我是你额上熏黑的矿灯，\r\n照在你历史的隧洞里蜗行摸索\r\n我是干瘪的稻穗，是失修的路基；\r\n是淤滩上的驳船\r\n把纤绳深深\r\n勒进你的肩膊，\r\n——祖国啊！\r\n\r\n我是贫困，\r\n我是悲哀。\r\n我是你祖祖辈辈\r\n
  \        痛苦的希望啊，\r\n是“飞天”袖间\r\n千百年未落到地面的花朵，\r\n——祖国啊！\r\n\r\n我是你簇新的理想，\r\n刚从神话的蛛网里挣脱；\r\n我是你雪被下古莲的胚芽；\r\n我是你挂着眼泪的笑涡；\r\n我是新刷出的雪白的起跑线；\r\n是绯红的黎明\r\n
  \        正在喷薄；\r\n—— 祖国啊！\r\n\r\n我是你的十亿分之一，\r\n是你九百六十万平方的总和；\r\n你以伤痕累累的乳房\r\n喂养了\r\n迷惘的我、深思的我、
  沸腾的我；\r\n那就从我的血肉之躯上\r\n去取得\r\n你的富饶、你的荣光、你的自由；\r\n—— 祖国啊，\r\n我亲爱的祖国！"
transpoem: "I am the wan, battered waterwheel by your riverbank,\r\nweaving a haggard
  song for hundreds of years;\r\nI am the smoke-smeared miner’s lamp on your forehead,
  \r\nshining into the tunnel of your history, \r\nsearching and groping.\r\nI am
  the husk of rice, shriveled; the roadbed, out of repair;\r\nI am the barge mired
  in the silted strand,\r\ntowed, a rope \r\ncarving into your arms and shoulders;\r\n—
  O Motherland!\r\n\r\nI am poverty, \r\nI am sorrow.\r\nI am your generations of
  generations\r\n        in aching hope,\r\nI am the flowers in the wide sleeves of
  Feitian\r\nthat, for thousands of years,\r\nhave not landed;\r\n— O Motherland!\r\n\r\nI
  am your youngest wish, \r\nshaking off the cobwebs of mythos;\r\nI am the embryo
  of an ancient lotus, \r\ngerminating under your quilt of snow;\r\nI am the tears
  pooling in the crease of your smile;\r\nI am your starting line, just painted;\r\nthe
  red light of dawn, \r\n        effusing, racing, \r\noutpouring;\r\n— O Motherland!\r\n\r\nI
  am one fraction of your billions, \r\nI am the sum of your nine-million-six-hundred-thousand
  square;\r\nYou with your breasts, inscribed \r\nwith wounds, have nurtured me, \r\nwho
  waits \r\nin bewilderment, in musing, in rapture;\r\nso from my body of skin and
  pulse\r\nplease, take\r\nyour glory, your flourishing, your liberation;\r\n— O Motherland,\r\nMy
  dear Motherland!"
note: "<p>I used to be daunted by the impossible task of being “absolutely faithful”
  in translation but have since learned to enjoy the process as a creative endeavor
  while maintaining the utmost respect for the poet and the original work. In \"O
  Motherland, My Dear Motherland,\" what I tried to preserve was not the word-for-word
  translation, but the overall sentiment: we are enraptured by our country’s glorious
  moments, and we become deeply disappointed when she stops trying for herself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
  first two lines in the original poem rhyme, with a variation in inflection that
  is unique to Chinese lyricism. Having recognized that it is very difficult to preserve
  such end rhyme without compromising syntactic clarity in English, I decided to utilize
  internal rhyme (“battered,” “haggard”), and let the poem sing through alliteration
  and assonance (“wan,” “waterwheel,” “weaving”). These drawn-out sounds also aptly
  capture the weariness of the old waterwheel with an almost onomatopoeia, a pleasant
  surprise that even the original Chinese could not deliver. Such an aspect of the
  poem is a result of my process: I read the lines aloud one time after another to
  let the sounds come to me and guide me, and then, amazingly, the meanings soon followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
  the poem, the imagery least accessible to English speakers is perhaps <em>Feitian</em>,
  which refers to the flying female spirits painted on the walls of <em>Mogaoku</em>
  in <em>Dunhuang</em> (widely known as “Thousand Buddha Grottoes”). I initially translated
  the imagery into <em>apsaras</em> — defined by the Oxford Dictionary as female spirits
  in Hindu and Buddhist culture. Yet I soon realized how the seemingly accessible
  rendering could be misleading. <em>Apsaras</em> are strongly associated with Indian
  Buddhism. <em>Feitian</em> evokes the many treasured Chinese relics in <em>Dunhuang</em>
  that have been snatched by other civilizations and are, still, unreturned. This
  case presents a stricter version of “faithfulness” in translation — an impossible
  yet necessary task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, the word choice in the original
  poem was no less difficult; Shu Ting’s work was initially denied publishing on the
  basis of superfluous imagery and obscurity. The “waterwheel” we see here was an
  edit from “windmill” in an effort to make it more relatable to the average Chinese
  man. Another suggestion was made to change “weaving [the song]” to “singing [the
  song]” (“how could one weave a song?”), but Shu Ting remained firm in her choice.
  The poem was finally published in the official poetry journal, <em>Shi Kan</em>,
  and became widely applauded for the human, fervent, and discerning expression of
  “patriotism.”</p>"
abio: "<p>Shu Ting (1952–) is arguably the most celebrated contemporary Chinese female
  poet. Born in Fujian in Southeast China, she lived through the Cultural Revolution
  (1966–1976), the most tumultuous and tortured years for Chinese intellectuals. In
  1969, she was sent to the countryside, forced by the government who sought to transform
  “privileged urban-educated youths” into “cultural workers” to serve the people.
  This movement destroyed many treasured Chinese literary and artistic works; the
  entire generation was denied access to formal education. It also inspired poets
  like Shu Ting to read and write even more fervently in quiet protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Widely
  considered a part of the “Misty School” along with poets like Bei Dao and Gu Cheng,
  Shu Ting writes in a penetrating language beyond the label. “O Motherland, My Dear
  Motherland” won the National Poetry Award in 1980; more importantly, it speaks of
  profound, ambivalent feelings that one can harbor for one’s country. Shu Ting is
  now back in her hometown, serving as the Chair of Xiamen Federation of Literary
  Art Circles and Member of China Writers’ Association.</p>\r\n"
tbio: "<p>Yuxin Wen (affectionately known as Viv/Vivi/Vivian) is a sophomore studying
  comparative literature and art history at Penn. She never thought she would become
  a translator until she found herself angry at the <em>absence</em> of good translations
  and the <em>presence</em> of bad translations of most Chinese poems. She strives
  to find English words that allow her to share the beauty of her mother tongue. Besides
  languages, she has a healthy obsession for running, watercolor painting, and writing
  letters, and her favorite foods are still back in Asia.</p>"
