transtitle: Where Does Such Tenderness Come From?
author: Marina Tsvetaeva
translator: Jianing Zhao
poem: "<em>О. Э. Мандельштаму</em>\r\n\r\nОткуда такая нежность?\r\nНе первые — эти
  кудри\r\nРазглаживаю, и губы\r\nЗнавала темней твоих.\r\n\r\nВсходили и гасли звезды,\r\nОткуда
  такая нежность?—\r\nВсходили и гасли очи\r\nУ самых моих очей.\r\n\r\nЕще не такие
  гимны\r\nЯ слушала ночью темной,\r\nВенчаемая — о нежность!—\r\nНа самой груди певца.\r\n\r\nОткуда
  такая нежность,\r\nИ что с нею делать, отрок\r\nЛукавый, певец захожий,\r\nС ресницами
  — нет длинней?"
transpoem: "<em>to O. E. Mandelstam</em>\r\n\r\nWhere does such tenderness come from?
  \r\nNot the first ones — these curls \r\nthat I’m untwirling, and I have known \r\nlips
  darker than yours. \r\n\r\nStars rose and dimmed, \r\nWhere does such tenderness
  come from? \r\nEyes rose and dimmed — your eyes, \r\nGazing into my own.\r\n\r\nNot
  yet have I heard hymns like this, \r\nthrough the darkness — oh tenderness!\r\ncharmed,
  crowned on the chest \r\nof the singer’s, and rest.\r\n\r\nWhere does such tenderness
  come from? \r\nAnd what to do with it — you youthful, \r\nsauntering sly singer,
  have I known \r\neyelashes longer than yours?\r\n"
note: "<p>I used to believe that poetry is what’s lost during translations. Now that
  I’m carrying out a translation myself, I’m thinking about how to minimize the loss,
  what to lose, and what to gain in turn. I tried to stick to Tsvetaeva’s original
  syntax as much as possible although it’s often all over the place, a result of both
  the flexibility of Russian sentence structures and Tsvetaeva’s personal style. I
  supplied my own interpretations at places of ambiguity. For example, in the second
  stanza, Tsvetaeva didn’t specify whose eyes are “at my own” (literally) or “gazing
  into my own,” so I added “— your eyes” in the end of the third line, to keep the
  stylistic consistency with the first line (as Tsvetaeva did) and simultaneously
  distinguish it: while both stars and eyes “rose and dimmed,” I proposed that there
  is a difference between the vast vagueness of the stars and the specificity of the
  eyes that are the narrator’s concern. Another example is last two lines of the third
  stanza: literally translated, it would be “had a wedding in church — oh tenderness!
  — on the singer’s own chest.” Instead of resorting to the clumsy word “married,”
  I chose words that I thought captured the essence of the scene depicted while evoking
  the idea of a church wedding. I eventually settled on “charm,” “crown,” and “rest,”
  keeping in mind also the flow and rhythm of the stanza. Although Tsvetaeva didn’t
  employ a rhyme scheme, since this stanza is about a hymn, I decided to use some
  end rhyme and alliteration to render a sense of melody — one that’s a bit arbitrary
  and non-systematic (especially with the abruptness of the intrusion “oh tenderness!”),
  corresponding to the tonality of the hymn drifting through the dark night. I also
  framed the ending to resemble the ending of the first stanza, except that it turns
  from a declarative sentence to a question, which corresponds to the evolution of
  the narrator’s emotions throughout the poem — from trying to find a rational explanation
  for the unusual tenderness she feels towards him, to the realization of her complete
  infatuation despite all doubts and criticisms. The ending, therefore, is an exclamation
  masked by a question.</p>"
abio: "<p>Marina Ivanovna Tsvetaeva (<span lang=”ru”>Марина Ивановна Цветаева</span>)
  was a Russian poet, born in Moscow, whose work is considered among the greatest
  in twentieth-century Russian literature. She lived through and wrote of the Russian
  Revolution of 1917. Her daughter died of the famine that followed the revolution,
  her husband was executed on espionage charges, and she committed suicide in 1941.
  Many of her poems (such as a famous one starting with “I’ve cut open my veins…”)
  handle rather heavy topics with daring linguistic experimentation, establishing
  her as a striking chronicler of her times and of the human condition in tragic circumstances.
  In this poem, however, we see another side of Tsvetaeva: she had a brief love affair
  with Osip Mandelstam, also a famous poet, when her husband was in the White Army.
  This poem was written in 1916 and dedicated to Mandelstam: here we can see her passion,
  her interest in temporality, and her emerging style of circular structure and unusual
  syntax.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Jianing Zhao is a sophomore at Princeton University majoring in comparative
  literature and minoring in archaeology, theater, and gender and sexuality studies.
  Based on her unrequited love for Soviet rock music, poetry (especially by Mayakovsky),
  and plays (especially those by Schwartz), she believes she was born in the wrong
  time and place. One of her favorite places in the world is a Soviet non-conformist
  art gallery hidden in the depth of an alley in St. Petersburg.</p>"
