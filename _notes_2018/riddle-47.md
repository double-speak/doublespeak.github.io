transpoem: "<h1>Translated by Raymond Ohl</h1>\r\nLetters have nourished me, but I
  know not what letters are. I have lived in books, but am no more studious thereby.
  I have devoured the Muses, and yet so far have not myself made progress.\r\n\r\n<h1>Translated
  by Paull Franklin Baum</h1>\r\nA moth ate words.     To me it seemed\r\na remarkable
  fate,     when I learned of the marvel,\r\nthat the worm had swallowed     the speech
  of a man,\r\na thief in the night,     a renowned saying\r\nand its place itself.
  \    Though he swallowed the word\r\nthe thieving stranger     was no whit the wiser.\r\n\r\n<h1>Translated
  by Samantha Pious</h1>\r\nTo me it seemed a wondrous thing\r\na little moth went
  plundering\r\n— as though a burglar in the night —\r\nthe words a lettered man did
  write.\r\nNot only does it eat his speech\r\nit even takes the place in which\r\nthe
  speech was given, going through\r\nthe parchment and the binding too,\r\ndevouring
  all the craft and art\r\nof the scribe, who worked so hard\r\nto scan the verse,
  to find the rhymes,\r\nthat you might be inclined to mind\r\nthe teachings crammed
  in every line.\r\nIf you want to read good books,\r\nyou ought to curse that beast,
  that crook,\r\nthat greedy moth who dares to scoff\r\nthe text, the heading, and
  the gloss!\r\nStill, swallow though he may, he’s dumb\r\nand won’t grow wiser by
  a crumb!\r\n"
note: "<p>The Old English poem presented here is one of almost a hundred verse riddles
  preserved in a tenth-century manuscript known as the Exeter Book. Its modern-day
  editors, George Philip Krapp and Elliott Van Kirk Dobbie, titled it “Riddle 47”
  in the third volume of the <em>Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records</em> (1936). In <em>Sources
  and Analogues of Old English Poetry</em> (1976), Michael Allen and Daniel Calder
  trace its origins to a late–Classical Latin riddle by Symphosius (late fourth or
  early fifth century), which is available in Raymond Ohl’s edition and translation
  (1928).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The riddle’s answer (Latin <em>tinea</em>, Old English <em>moððe</em>,
  Modern English “book moth”) is obvious, but, as Patrick Murphy points out in <em>Unriddling
  the Exeter Riddles</em> (2005), it seems less important to get the solution right
  than to contemplate the paradox of an animal “devouring” words but not “ruminating”
  on them. Indeed, consuming without contemplating is more or less what the book moth
  does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This translation began as a thought experiment for Old English
  Live, an annual celebration organized by Emily Steiner at the University of Pennsylvania
  where participants share creative reimaginings of Old English poetry. At Professor
  Steiner’s suggestion, I decided to translate an Old English riddle into Middle French,
  as though I were a fourteenth-century poet. I imagined myself as Eustache Deschamps
  or Oton de Granson stumbling on an undiscovered copy of the Exeter Book riddles
  in the royal library of King Charles V and wondering what language, let alone what
  form or genre, he was looking at. Perhaps he would have managed to locate a copy
  of the riddle in its original Latin and been able to decipher the Old English from
  there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, translation practices in the fourteenth century
  were very different from what they are today. Middle French narrative couplets tend
  to lend themselves to far more prolixity than Old English alliterative verse, and
  I’m afraid the poet may have allowed his feelings to run away with him. The French
  riddle is twenty lines — more than twice the length of its Old English source, to
  say nothing of the Latin original!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, I’ve added a relatively
  faithful Modern English translation of the “Middle French” version — except that,
  for better or worse, I embellished the English verse with far more internal rhymes
  than there are in the source text. Am I as flighty as the book moth? Or did I contemplate
  too much?</p>"
abio: "<p>Symphosius was the author of a renowned collection of one hundred Latin
  riddles, entitled <em>Aenigmata</em>. The collection was most likely written in
  the late antique period. Many of the riddles, along with their solutions, have been
  transmitted.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Samantha Pious is a doctoral student in comparative literature at the University
  of Pennsylvania. Her first book, <em>A Crown of Violets</em> (Headmistress Press,
  2017) offers a selection of verse translations from the French poetry of Renée Vivien.
  Some of her translations and poems have appeared in <em>Berkeley Poetry Review</em>,
  <em>Lavender Review</em>, <em>Lunch Ticket</em>, <em>Mezzo Cammin</em>, and other
  publications.</p>\r\n"
