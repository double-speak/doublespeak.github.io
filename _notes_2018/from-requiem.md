poem: "<h1>К смерти</h1>\r\n<h1>8</h1>\r\nТы все равно придешь — зачем же не теперь?\r\nЯ
  жду тебя — мне очень трудно.\r\nЯ потушила свет и отворила дверь\r\nТебе, такой
  простой и чудной.\r\nПрими для этого какой угодно вид,\r\nВорвись отравленным снарядом\r\nИль
  с гирькой подкрадись, как опытный бандит,\r\nИль отрави тифозным чадом.\r\nИль сказочкой,
  придуманной тобой\r\nИ всем до тошноты знакомой,—\r\nЧтоб я увидела верх шапки голубой\r\nИ
  бледного от страха управдома.\r\nМне все равно теперь. Клубится Енисей,\r\nЗвезда
  Полярная сияет.\r\nИ синий блеск возлюбленных очей\r\nПоследний ужас застилает.\r\n\r\n<h1>Эпилог</h1>\r\n<h1>I</h1>\r\nУзнала
  я, как опадают лица,\r\nКак из-под век выглядывает страх,\r\nКак клинописи жесткие
  страницы\r\nСтрадание выводит на щеках,\r\nКак локоны из пепельных и черных\r\nСеребряными
  делаются вдруг,\r\nУлыбка вянет на губах покорных,\r\nИ в сухоньком смешке дрожит
  испуг.\r\nИ я молюсь не о себе одной,\r\nА обо всех, кто там стоял со мною,\r\nИ
  в лютый холод, и в июльский зной\r\nПод красною ослепшею стеною.\r\n"
transpoem: "<h1>8</h1>\r\n<h1>To Death</h1>\r\nYou will come. Why not at once?\r\nI
  wait for you. I find it difficult. \r\nI have blown out the candles, unlocked the
  door\r\nfor you, simple and wondrous thing. \r\nPut on any sort of face, any form
  —\r\nblow me up with an arsenious grenade, \r\nor sneak up with a kettlebell, like
  an experienced bandit\r\nor infect me with typhus,\r\nor do it with a little story,
  made up by you\r\nand familiar to all, ad nauseam —\r\nfor which I will be taken\r\npast
  the blanched face of the superintendent\r\nto the commander in the blue cap.\r\nIt’s
  all the same for me now:\r\nThe Yenisei river ripples, Polaris twinkles\r\nand the
  blue gleam of the beloved eyes \r\nglazes over in the final terror.     \r\n\r\n<h1>Epilogue</h1>\r\n<h1>I</h1>\r\nI’ve
  soon found out how faces fall,\r\nhow lashes hide a trace of fear,\r\nhow suffering
  is etched on cheeks\r\nin crude strokes of cuneiform,\r\nhow strands of black or
  ashen hair\r\ncan silver in a day or hour,\r\nthe smile wilts on docile lips, \r\nthe
  hollow laugh trembles with fear. \r\nI pray not for myself alone\r\nbut everyone
  who stood with me;\r\nin savage cold, in the heat of July  \r\nbeside a wall, brick-red
  and blind. \r\n"
note: "<p>Akhmatova’s <em>Requiem</em> is a cycle of poems about the years of terror
  in Russia (1935–1938) known as the Great Purge. Although written during and soon
  after the events it describes, the cycle remained unpublished in Russia until 1987,
  thirty-five years after Stalin’s death. The two poems above capture the two main
  subjects of the cycle: Akhmatova’s individual suffering and the suffering of the
  many in Russia. In “To Death,” Akhmatova alludes either to her son Lev being taken
  to a labor camp in Siberia or to her former husband, Nikolai Gumilev, being shot.
  In “Epilogue I,” Akhmatova mentions all those who waited on the prison lines to
  visit friends and family members, often to no avail. The shift from the individual
  to the collective is distinct here in that Akhmatova’s voice remains heard; the
  pronoun “I” is still used.</p>\r\n<p>I chose not to carry over the formal structure
  of the poems, which includes rhyme and a distinct Russian cadence, as it is heavily
  reliant on the Russian language’s easily-formed end-rhymes and fluid word order.
  However, some echo of form may be felt in the use of iambic tetrameter of “Epilogue
  I.” Although the emotional register of the poems is expressed in the original through
  the rhyme and rhythm, giving the content its expressive power, I tried to stay as
  close as possible to the images in the poem, which communicate by being direct and
  precise, and letting the sound follow.</p>\r\n"
abio: "<p>Anna Akhmatova (1889–1966) was an acclaimed Russian poet of the “Silver
  Age” of Russian poetry, the first half of the twentieth century. After moving to
  St. Petersburg, Akhmatova became a part of the Acmeists, a literary group of six
  people who attempted to write poetry in traditional form that focused on the objects
  and incidents of everyday life, in contrast with the highly experimental poetry
  in fashion at the time. During the war years, Akhmatova’s former husband Nikolai
  Gumilev was shot, her son Lev was imprisoned and exiled to Siberia, and her close
  friend Osip Mandelstam was arrested, exiled, and shot. <em>Requiem</em>, along with
  many other poems, was a response to those times. Beginning in 1925, Akhmatova’s
  poetry was banned by the Soviet government; even when the official ban was lifted,
  the implicit ban remained. Still, her poetry circulated orally and on scraps of
  paper that were burned upon being read. Akhmatova is known as the mother of the
  modern female Russian voice, freeing it to speak about complex topics including
  and other than love. She is also known as one of the only well-known poets to outlive
  the Stalinist era, stay in Russia, and chronicle those times.</p>\r\n"
tbio: "<p>Yehudith Dashevsky is a junior studying English, Russian, and Hebrew literature.
  She has also dabbled in Arabic and Old English. Her fascination with translation
  stems from her mental blocks in the world of words, and she is repeatedly amazed
  at how the space in the imagination before language is bridged when the right words
  (for a given time and place) are found. One word she recently encountered and was
  surprised exists is “idiolect,” which according to Wikipedia is “an individual’s
  distinctive and unique use of language.”</p>"
