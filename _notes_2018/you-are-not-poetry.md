pid: you-are-not-poetry
title: Poesía no eres tú
transtitle: You Are Not Poetry
author: Rosario Castellanos
translator: Stephanie Diaz
poem: "Porque si tú existieras\r\ntendría que existir yo también. Y eso es mentira.\r\n\r\nNada
  hay más que nosotros: la pareja,\r\nlos sexos conciliados en un hijo,\r\nlas dos
  cabezas juntas, pero no contemplándose\r\n(para no convertir a nadie en un espejo)\r\nsino
  mirando frente a sí, hacia el otro.\r\n\r\nEl otro: mediador, juez, equilibrio\r\nentre
  opuestos, testigo,\r\nnudo en el que se anuda lo que se había roto.\r\n\r\nEl otro,
  la mudez que pide voz\r\nal que tiene la voz\r\ny reclama el oído del que escucha.\r\n\r\nEl
  otro. Con el otro\r\nla humanidad, el diálogo, la poesía, comienzan."
transpoem: "Because if you existed,\r\nI would also have to, and that is wrong.\r\n\r\nNothing
  but us: the couple, \r\nsexes reconciled in a child,\r\nheads together, neither
  studying the other\r\n(to avoid turning into a mirror)\r\ninstead looking ahead
  towards each other.\r\n\r\nThe other: mediator, judge, balance\r\nbetween opposites.
  Witness, knot\r\nin which the broken is tied.\r\n\r\nThe other: muteness that asks\r\na
  voice of he who has one\r\nand demands the ear of he who listens\r\n\r\nThe other.
  With whom\r\nhumanity, dialogue, and poetry begin."
note: "<p>Above all, this poem seemed both intensely personal and yet widely universal.
  In this poem Castellanos addresses her quarrels with the concept of what a relationship
  is and what this means to her existence as an individual. I think that it’s particularly
  important to consider the time and place in which “Poesía no eres tú” was created,
  as the role of women at this point in time was often very restrictive.</p>\r\n<p>In
  translating this poem, I stumbled on the first stanza because of the line “Y eso
  es mentira.” First of all, the line begins with the word “and,” a conjunction which
  every elementary teacher clearly told me should never start a sentence. In the original
  version I found that <em>y</em> has a more disruptive quality because the sharp
  sound of its pronunciation does not allow you to rest after the end of the first
  sentence, but instead pushes you into Castellanos’ next definitive line. Secondly,
  the sentence itself is a bit tricky since it does not use an article. Literally,
  the line reads “And that is lie.” To clear up this issue, I first tried to simply
  insert the article and say, “And that is a lie.” However, I found that this version
  did not quite pack the same punch that Castellano’s did. I then realized that what
  made her version so impactful was that I could imagine the lines being spoken in
  an argument, so my translation of “and that is <em>wrong</em>” was my effort to
  replicate this effect.</p>\r\n"
abio: "<p>Rosario Castellanos, born in 1925, was a Mexican writer and diplomat who
  is considered one of Mexico’s most important authors and poets. Castellanos wrote
  on topics including Mexican culture and gender, often focusing on the intersection
  and implications of being a Mexican woman. Another subject which Castellanos highlighted
  in her works was the indigenous population of her native Chiapas. In addition to
  addressing injustices committed against this population, Castellanos also worked
  with the National Indigenous Institute to improve literacy in this region. In her
  later years Castellano served as the Mexican ambassador to Israel.</p>"
