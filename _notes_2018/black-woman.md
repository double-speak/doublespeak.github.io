poem: "Femme nue, femme noire\r\nVêtue de ta couleur qui est vie, de ta forme qui
  est beauté!\r\nJ’ai grandi à ton ombre ; la douceur de tes mains bandait\r\nmes
  yeux.\r\nEt voilà qu’au coeur de l’Eté et de Midi, je te découvre,\r\nTerre promise,
  du haut d’un haut col calciné\r\nEt ta beauté me foudroie en plein coeur, comme
  l’éclair\r\nd’un aigle.\r\nFemme nue, femme obscure\r\nFruit mûr à la chair ferme,
  sombres extases du vin noir,\r\nbouche qui fais lyrique ma bouche\r\nSavane aux
  horizons purs, savane qui frémis aux caresses\r\nferventes du Vent d’Est\r\nTamtam
  sculpté, tamtam tendu qui grondes sous les doigts\r\ndu vainqueur\r\nTa voix grave
  de contralto est le chant spirituel de l’Aimée.\r\nFemme nue, femme obscure\r\nHuile
  que ne ride nul souffle, huile calme aux flancs de\r\nl’athlète, aux flancs des
  princes du Mali\r\nGazelle aux attaches célestes, les perles sont étoiles sur\r\nla
  nuit de ta peau\r\nDélices des jeux de l’esprit, les reflets de l’or rouge sur ta\r\npeau
  qui se moire\r\nA l’ombre de ta chevelure, s’éclaire mon angoisse aux\r\nsoleils
  prochains de tes yeux.\r\nFemme nue, femme noire\r\nJe chante ta beauté qui passe,
  forme que je fixe dans l’Eternel\r\nAvant que le Destin jaloux ne te réduise en
  cendres pour\r\nnourrir les racines de la vie"
transpoem: "Bare Woman, Black Woman \r\n\r\nWrapped in your color which is life, in
  your shape which is beauty\r\nI grew up in your shadow; your hands covered my eyes
  gently\r\nAnd now, at the height of summer and at midday, \r\nI find you, the Promised
  Land, at the summit of a high, scorched mountain pass\r\nAnd as lightning strikes
  an eagle, your beauty strikes my heart. \r\n\r\nBare Woman, Black Woman \r\n\r\nRipe
  fruit with firm flesh, the dark rapture of black wine, lips that my mouth makes
  songs about\r\nTo the pure horizons of the Savannah, the Savannah that trembles
  with the reverent caresses of the East Wind\r\nSculpted rhythm, tense rhythm that
  rumbles under the fingers of the victorious\r\nYour deep, contralto voice is the
  spiritual chant of the Loved \r\n\r\nBare Woman, Black Woman\r\n\r\nOil that no
  breeze can ripple, oil that soothes the sides of an athlete and the sides of Mali’s
  princes. \r\n\r\nA gazelle with celestial ties, pearls are stars on the night of
  your skin\r\nThe sparkle of gold that consumes your iridescent skin, is a delight
  to the Soul\r\nIn the shadow of your hair, my anxieties are lightened by the sunlight
  coming from your eyes. \r\n\r\nBare Woman, Black Woman\r\n\r\nI sing of your passing
  beauty, a form that I fix among the Eternal\r\nBefore jealous fate reduces you to
  ashes that will nourish the roots of life. "
note: "<p>This poem is deeply rooted in the principles of Négritude that Senghor helped
  establish in France in the 1930s. The idea of celebrating and finding pride in blackness
  is evident in the way this poem conceptualizes a “Black Woman” as an almost otherworldly
  being, one that demands respect for simply her way of existing. As American society
  today is at a crossroads in terms of representations of Black women in media and
  in literature, I decided to translate this poem as a way to bring attention to the
  way poetry discusses Black women and to the fact that Black women are often absent
  in mainstream poetry.</p>"
abio: "<p>Léopald Sédar Senghor was born in Joal, Senegal in 1906 and died in 2001
  in Verson, France. At the age of eight, Senghor began his studies at a Christian
  boarding school. He later went onto to attend seminary but decided to leave the
  religious life behind to attend a secular university. After he completed his Baccalaureate,
  he continued his studies in France where formed a group with other intellectuals
  from the African diaspora. This group would eventually begin the Négritude movement
  in response to the racism present in France. This movement became a strong foundation
  for the rest of his literary work. The majority of his poetry addresses his opinions
  on Blackness and the complex relationship between France and its former colonies.
  The idea of Négritude also served as the basis for his political thought as he later
  advocated for Senegal’s independence from France. After the separation, he became
  the first president of Senegal. When he took his leave from politics he retired
  to France to publish more poetry and he was inducted into the French Academy as
  their first African member. He remains well-known as one of the most important twentieth-century
  African intellectuals.</p>\r\n"
