pid: repose
title: Giacere
transtitle: Repose
author: Antonia Pozzi
translator: Stephanie Diaz
poem: "Ora l’annientamento blando\r\ndi nuotare riversa,\r\ncol sole in viso\r\n—
  il cervello penetrato di rosso\r\ntraverso le palpebre chiuse —.\r\nStasera, sopra
  il letto, nella stessa postura,\r\nil candore trasognato\r\ndi bere,\r\ncon le pupille
  larghe,\r\nl’anima bianca della notte."
transpoem: "Now the languid annihilation\r\nof swimming backstroke,\r\nthe sun in
  your face\r\n\tbrain interrupted by red \r\nacross eyes shut tight.\r\nTonight,
  on the sheets, in the same shape,\r\nthe moony candor\r\nof drinking,\r\nwith wide
  eyes,\r\nnight’s white life.\r\n"
note: "<p>I do not speak Italian, so this creating this translation was quite a trip!
  With the assistance of native speakers as well as Professor Silverman (who teaches
  a course on poetry translation at Penn), I was able to get a better feeling of the
  poem. In “Repose,” I focused on highlighting the intense physical sensations that
  Pozzi invokes in her version. In the line “– il cervello penetrato di rosso / traverso
  le palpebre chiuse –” Pozzi makes use of dashes to distinguish the sensation described
  from the rest of the piece. In my translation, I felt that, given the nature of
  the physicality of this line, it would be interesting to manifest this distinction
  in a more physical form. For this reason, I chose to indent the lines “brain interrupted
  by red / across eyes shut tight.”</p>\r\n<p>“Tonight, on the sheets, in the same
  shape,” was perhaps the hardest part of the poem to translate, as I really loved
  the repetition of <em>s</em> sounds in Pozzi’s version. While I didn’t manage to
  find an equivalent for “tonight” that had a similar sound, I worked to maintain
  the <em>s</em> and <em>sh</em> sounds in the rest of the sentence.</p>\r\n"
abio: "<p>Antonia Pozzi was an Italian poet born in 1912 and died at the age of 26
  in 1938. After her death her father collected poems and letters written by Pozzi
  and assembled them in a book which he heavily censored. Most notably, Pozzi’s father
  made efforts to exclude mentions of Pozzi’s longtime lover and former teacher. Newer
  publications and translations of her work have made efforts to reduce these “edits”
  and present a version which is more in line with Pozzi’s poems.</p>"
