poem: "Warte\r\nbis die Buchstaben heimgekehrt sind\r\naus der lodernden Wüste \r\nund
  gegessen von heiligen Mündern\r\nwarte\r\nbis du die Geistergeologie der Liebe\r\naufgerissen
  \r\nund ihre Zeitalter durchglüht\r\nund leuchtend von seligen Fingerziegen \r\nwieder
  ihr Schöpfungswort fand: \r\nda auf dem Papier \r\ndas sterbend singt: \r\n\r\nEs
  war\r\nam Anfang\r\n        Es war\r\n                Geliebter\r\n                        Es

transpoem: "Wait, dear \r\nuntil the letters and words have come home\r\nfrom the
  blazing desert \r\nwhere they were swallowed by sacred mouths.\r\nWait, dear\r\nuntil
  love’s ghost-geology \r\nripped itself open,\r\nglowing through years of the universe\r\nand
  gleaming from the tips of holy fingers,  \r\nand found, again, “Let there be…”\r\n\r\nThere,
  on the page, \r\ndying as it sings, \r\n\r\n        There was, in the Beginning,
  \r\n                my beloved. \r\n                        There was —"
note: "<p>This poem takes place in a wonderful knot, where letters and words pulse
  and push through a world that is beginning and ending at the same time. It is appropriate
  for Nelly Sachs, who, like her friend, penpal, and fellow Holocaust survivor Paul
  Celan, believed certain things to be inexpressible. “Warte” takes place in the future,
  the present, and the past, sometimes using conflicting or confusing tenses. It simultaneously
  speaks to the Bible and the Big Bang. In the process of translation, I tried to
  bring all those elements through.</p>"
abio: "<p>Nelly Sachs (December 10, 1891–May 12, 1970) was a Jewish poet, playwright,
  and translator. She grew up in Germany but fled to Sweden in 1940 after she found
  out she was to be imprisoned in a labor camp. Though she escaped the Holocaust,
  she later had several nervous breakdowns driven by her fear of the Nazis. Many of
  her poems center on Jewish suffering: when she won the Nobel Prize for Literature
  in 1966, she said, “I represent the tragedy of the Jewish people.”</p>"
