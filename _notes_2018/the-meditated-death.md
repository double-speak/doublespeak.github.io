poem: "<h1>Canto primo</h1>\r\nO sorella dell’ombra,\r\nNotturna quanto più la luce
  ha forza,\r\nM’insegui, morte.\r\nIn un giardino puro\r\nAlla luce ti diè l’ingenua
  brama\r\nE la pace fu persa,\r\nPensosa morte,\r\nSulla tua bocca.\r\nDa quel momento\r\nTi
  odo nel fluire della mente\r\nApprofondite lontananze,\r\nEmula sofferente dell’eterno.\r\nMadre
  velenosa degli evi\r\nNella paura del palpito\r\nE della solitudine,\r\nBellezza
  punita e ridente,\r\nNell’assopirsi della carne\r\nSognatrice fuggente,\r\nAtleta
  senza sonno\r\nDella nostra grandezza,\r\nQuando m’avrai domato, dimmi:\r\nNella
  malinconia dei vivi\r\nVolerà a lungo la mia ombra?\r\n<h1>Canto secondo</h1>\r\nScava
  le intime vite\r\nDella nostra infelice maschera\r\n(clausura d’infinito)\r\nCon
  blandizia fanatica\r\nLa buia veglia dei padri.\r\nMorte, muta parola,\r\nSabbia
  deposta come un letto\r\nDal sangue,\r\nTi odo cantare come una cicala\r\nNella
  rosa abbrunata dei riflessi.\r\n<h1>Canto terzo</h1>\r\nIncide le rughe segrete\r\nDella
  nostra infelice maschera\r\nLa beffa infinita dei padri.\r\nTu, nella luce fonda,\r\nO
  confuso silenzio,\r\nInsisti come le cicale irose.\r\n<h1>Canto quarto</h1>\r\nMi
  presero per mano nuvole.\r\nBrucio sul colle spazio e tempo,\r\nCome un tuo messaggero,\r\nCome
  il sogno, divina morte.\r\n<h1>Canto quinto</h1>\r\nHai chiuso gli occhi.\r\nNasce
  una morte\r\nPiena di finte buche,\r\nDi suoni morti,\r\nCome di sugheri\r\nDi reti
  calate nell’acqua.\r\nLe tue mani si fanno come un soffio\r\nD’inviolabili lontananze,\r\nInafferrabili
  come le idee,\r\nE l’equivoco della luna\r\nE il dondolio, dolcissimi,\r\nSe vuoi
  posarmele sugli occhi,\r\nToccano l’anima.\r\nSei la donna che passa\r\nCome una
  foglia\r\nE lasci agli alberi un fuoco d’autunno.\r\n<h1>Canto sesto</h1>\r\nO bella
  preda,\r\nVoce notturna,\r\nLe tue movenze\r\nFomentano la febbre.\r\nSolo tu, memoria
  demente,\r\nLa libertà potevi catturare.\r\nSulla tua carne inafferrabile\r\nE vacillante
  dentro specchi torbidi,\r\nQuali delitti, sogno,\r\nNon m’insegnasti a consumare?\r\nCon
  voi, fantasmi, non ho mai ritegno,\r\nE dei vostri rimorsi ho pieno il cuore\r\nQuando
  fa giorno.\r\n"
transpoem: "<h1>First Canto</h1>\r\nO sister of shadow,\r\ndarker in the brightest
  of lights,\r\nyou chase me, death.\r\nIn an untouched garden\r\nnaive craving bore
  you,\r\nand peace,\r\npensive death,\r\nwas lost on your mouth.\r\nSince that moment\r\nI
  have heard you in the flows of my mind\r\ndeepening distances,\r\naching imitator
  of the eternity.\r\nVenomous mother of ages,\r\nin the fear of throb\r\nand loneliness,\r\npunished
  and laughing Beauty,\r\nin the slumber of flesh,\r\nfugitive dreamer,\r\nsleepless
  athlete\r\nof our greatness,\r\nonce you have tamed me, tell me:\r\nWill my shadow
  fly long\r\nin the melancholy of the living?\r\n<h1>Second Canto</h1>\r\nThe dark
  vigil of our fathers\r\nwith its crazy blandishments\r\nhollows out the intimate
  lives\r\nof our unhappy mask\r\n(enclosure of the infinite).\r\nDeath, still word,\r\nsand
  laid as a bed\r\nby blood,\r\nI hear you singing like a locust\r\nin the darkened
  rose of reflections.\r\n<h1>Third Canto</h1>\r\nThe eternal deception of our fathers\r\nEngraves
  secret wrinkles\r\nOn our unhappy masks.\r\nIn the broad light,\r\nyou, confused
  silence,\r\ninsist like tense locusts.\r\n<h1>Fourth Canto</h1>\r\nClouds took me
  by the hand.\r\nUpon the hill, I consume space and time\r\nlike your harbinger,\r\nlike
  a dream, divine death.\r\n<h1>Fifth canto</h1>\r\nYou have closed your eyes.\r\nA
  night is born,\r\na night full of false holes,\r\nof dead sounds,\r\nlike corks\r\nof
  nets dropped into the water.\r\nYour hands become a breath\r\nof inviolable distances,\r\nas
  unreachable as ideas,\r\nand the moon’s ambiguity\r\nand its swinging — so tender
  —\r\nif you want to lay them on my eyes,\r\nthey touch my soul.\r\nYou are the woman\r\nwho
  goes by like a leaf\r\nand you leave the trees like a fire during fall.\r\n<h1>Sixth
  canto</h1>\r\nO beautiful prey,\r\nnocturnal voice,\r\nthe way you move\r\nraises
  my fever.\r\nOnly you, demented memory,\r\ncould capture freedom.\r\nOn your flesh,
  unreachable\r\nand wavering in turbid mirrors,\r\nwhat crimes, dream,\r\ndidn’t
  you lead me to commit?\r\nWith you, ghosts, I have no restraint\r\nand my heart
  is filled with your remorse\r\nwhen a new day rises.\r\n"
note: "<p>As usually happens when translating poetry, the title is the first challenge
  presented\r\nto the translator, and “La morte meditata” is no exception. First of
  all, one wonders what\r\n“la morte meditata” actually means. I believe the meaning
  of the title is closely connected\r\nto the act of reflecting on something, to meditate
  on what on what all human beings have\r\nin common — mortality. At some point of
  their lives, all people question themselves about\r\ndeath. This why I decided to
  translate the title as “The Meditated Death.” It does not\r\nrefer to death per
  se, but, more precisely, it refers to that meditated death that inevitably\r\nbecomes
  part of people’s thoughts.</p>\r\n<p>The poem is divided into six <em>canti</em>,
  which I decided to keep as “canto.” The most\r\nobvious and literal translation
  would be “song,” but I do not think it gives justice to\r\nUngaretti’s word choice.
  Furthermore, the word “canto” echoes the one hundred cantos of\r\nDante’s <em>Divine
  Comedy</em> — at least to the ears of an Italian speaker — and I think it is a fair\r\ntribute
  to the Italian literary tradition. One of the lines I liked the most is the fifth
  line of\r\nthe second canto, where death is defined as <em>muta parola</em> — “mute
  word.” It is an\r\nexceptionally powerful and paradoxical image, full of tension:
  How can a word be mute? It\r\ncan be so before it is spoken, when a word is still
  an idea, but it is nonetheless striking to\r\nthe reader. Instead of opting for
  “mute,” the most straightforward equivalent, I preferred\r\nusing “still.” It is
  such an interesting word in English, because it conveys both the meaning\r\nrelated
  to the sound, but also the idea of steadiness. And of course, nothing can be as\r\nsteady
  and motionless as death.</p>"
abio: "<p>Giuseppe Ungaretti was born on February 10, 1888, in Alexandria, Egypt,
  from an Italian family originating from Lucca (Tuscany). The multicultural and cosmopolitan
  city of Alexandria had a considerable influence both on his life and on his work.
  Ungaretti is mostly known in Italy as “Il poeta Ssldato,” that is, “the soldier
  poet.” In 1915, in fact, when Italy joined World War I, he decided to volunteer.
  World War I left a mark on his life. He got to know both the suffering of war, but
  also the true meaning of brotherhood.</p>\r\n<p>Giuseppe Ungaretti is certainly
  one of the most appreciated Italian poets of the twentieth century. Students remember
  him for writing very short and incisive poems, but what makes him so great is his
  experience of war that gave a very introspective cut to his poetry.</p>"
tbio: "<p>My name is Carla Rossi, I’m twenty-five, and I’m from Italy. Last year I
  spent the spring semester at Penn, and I fell in love with it. I’ve just graduated
  from the University of Bologna in conference interpreting, with a concentration
  in English and Spanish — so I mostly translate speeches from English and Spanish
  into Italian (but also the other way around). In my free time I like playing with
  words, talking to my friends, and planning my next travel.</p>"
