transtitle: I want to live with you
author: Marina Tsvetaeva
translator: Wenhan Zhang
poem: |-
  …Я бы хотела жить с Вами
  В маленьком городе,
  Где вечные сумерки
  И вечные колокола.
  И в маленькой деревенской гостинице —
  Тонкий звон
  Старинных часов — как капельки времени.
  И иногда, по вечерам, из какой-нибудь мансарды —
  Флейта,
  И сам флейтист в окне.
  И большие тюльпаны на окнах.
  И может быть, Вы бы даже меня любили…

  Посреди комнаты — огромная изразцовая печка,
  На каждом изразце — картинка:
  Роза — сердце — корабль. —
  А в единственном окне —
  Снег, снег, снег.

  Вы бы лежали — каким я Вас люблю: ленивый,
  Равнодушный, беспечный.
  Изредка резкий треск
  Спички.

  Папироса горит и гаснет,
  И долго-долго дрожит на ее краю
  Серым коротким столбиком — пепел.
  Вам даже лень его стряхивать —
  И вся папироса летит в огонь.
transpoem: "I want to live with you\nIn a small town where the sun sets endlessly\nand
  the bells chime endlessly.\nIn a little village inn,\nan ancient clock counts delicately,\nthe
  droplets of time. \nAnd on some evenings, the sound of flute drifts down from the
  attic.\nThe flutist leans by the window,\nwhere full tulips bloom.\nIn that moment,
  I wouldn’t mind if you didn’t love me. \n\nIn the middle of the room, there is a
  stove made of large tiles.\nOn each tile there is a painting:\nA rose, a heart,
  a ship. \nFrom our only window there is\nsnow, snow, snow. \n\nYou lie just as how
  I love you: nonchalantly, indifferently, carelessly. \nA match scratches the silence
  now and then. \n\nThe embers of your cigarette glow and then dim,\nAnd for a long,
  long time the cigarette trembles at its edge, trembling. \nShort, gray, white ashes,\nthat
  you’re too lazy to flick.\nAnd then the cigarette flies, dancing into the fire."

  <p>This translation is in fact a translation of the Chinese translation of the original Russian poem. I innovate as such because through the brief and delicate Chinese language, a kind of powerful yet wistful voice emerges from Tsvetaeva’s poems that I did not discern in the English versions. Like I wrote in the essay “The New Flowers of Language,” meanings are often consummated in other languages that the poet did not even know about. Through Chinese, I saw how powerfully and distinctly Tsvetaeva loved and I fell in love with that.</p>

  <p>In “I want to live with you,” the speaker’s love is filled with power and agency, as well as vulnerability and longing. She is not a devoted Petrarchan lover who withers in unrequited love, but a brave warrior who aspires to love. She loves him because she loves life, she loves love and she loves herself. “In that moment, I wouldn’t mind if you didn’t love me.“ is so wonderfully transient, nonchalant, and wistful.</p>

  <p>In translating the first line, I debated between a few choices including “I’d like to live with you,” “I want to spend my life with you” and “I want to live with you.” I chose the last for a childlike yet noncommittal insistence. The first line is the essence and the premise of the whole poem. The speaker loves him and makes a life out of this love, but ultimately, her love rests on her choice and not on his choice. She wants to live in that small town with love, instead of live anywhere else with him.</p>

  <p>I took inspiration from Chinese when translating the last line. There is a phrase in Chinese that translates as “flying moth dashes into the fire,” describing the dogged and death-seeking pursuit of an ideal. In my translation, I added the “dancing” imagery in “the cigarette flies, dancing into the fire,” imbuing the cigarette with life and agency. The cigarette is also a metaphor for the speaker, who knocks her fragile self against life and love, passionately and nonchalantly. Love means everything in the world, or nothing at all.</p>

  <p>I would like to thank Ryan Hardy in the <em>DoubleSpeak</em> team for illuminating features of Russian that really helped in my revision of the translation.</p>
abio: "<p>Marina Tsvetaeva (1892–1941) was born in Moscow and was one of the best
  twentieth-century poets in Russia and in the world. Extremely endowed, she published
  her first collection of poems, <em>Evening Album</em>, in 1910 when she was just
  eighteen, studying at the Sorbonne. Tsvetaeva lived in a most turbulent time in
  Russian history. In 1922, Tsvetaeva followed her husband, Sergey Efron, and emigrated
  to Paris, where they were socially marginalized. They returned to Russia in 1937
  in the midst of the Great Terror, where tragic fates awaited them. Her husband was
  arrested and shot; her sister was arrested and imprisoned; her daughter was arrested,
  fated to spend nineteen years in labor camps. Tsvetaeva was evacuated during World
  War II to Yelabuga on the Kama River near Kazan, where she hanged herself in 1941.
  Throughout her turbulent and troubled life, Tsvetaeva’s poems remained passionate,
  choleric, and muscular, yet musical. Poetry and correspondence with other poets
  sustained her. Tsvetaeva’s poems illuminated the grief, the intense inner life and
  the strength of a woman battered by an unspeakable fate. It is painful to read a
  wistful line like:</p> \n<pre>“I want to live with you\nIn a small town where the
  sun sets endlessly\nand the bells chime endlessly.”</pre>\n<p>She hums a tender
  song to a life that almost existed, but was never possible.</p>\n"
tbio: "<p>My name is Wenhan Zhang. I come from Singapore and China. I studied philosophy
  and computer science at Penn and now I am doing a Masters in computational science
  at Harvard. Studying and translating poetry in ENGL 120 with Professor Taije Silverman
  opened up the whole meaning of poetry to me. I knew then that writing, reading and
  translating poetry will forever be a big part of my life. Other than poetry, I love
  social entrepreneurship. I am interested in the intersection of technology, business
  and social change. Unexpectedly, I find language increasingly coming to the center
  of everything I hope to achieve. Language moves hearts, inspires changes, connects
  resources, and consummates meaning. It helps me find myself. It creates a performance
  out of life that makes it worth living, for myself and all others.</p>"
