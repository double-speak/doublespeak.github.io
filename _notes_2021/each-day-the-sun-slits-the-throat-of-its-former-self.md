transpoem: "each day the sun slits \nthe throat of its former self\nand rises in its
  blood\n\neach beginning \nrepresents a circle\na memory leads \nto a sea of possibilities\na
  pier is made of rock \na tree of exile\ni yearn for the horizon\n\non a thread of
  light\ni proceed towards \nthis place that is you\nand what was begins again\n\na
  star dances on the sky \nthat is my forehead\nthe bird within us is reborn \nfrom
  the nest of our soul\nyour word is yours mine is my own\n\nyou return to the place
  that I am\nand the poem begins to write itself\n\ni see your face and \nthe shadow
  on your face\nlike a poem your suffering is shared\nwe share the grief of a withering
  tree\ntoo brief and at the mercy of the seasons\nof the smiles and of the rifts
  of the earth\nof men’s misfortunes of women’s prayers\n\nwith our wishes a moment
  takes \nits dazzled form\ntime fades like a landscape\nwe live the two halves of
  our lives\nas if on a journey we perhaps remember\nthe name of islands of birds
  of ports\nof the white wake of boats of cities of beings\nof the cycle of arrivals
  and of departures\n\nand we fall in love with the night\nbecause each night celebrates
  \na dream’s wedding\nand we fall in love with the day\nbecause life begins with
  each day\n"

  <p>I have loved the poems of Amina Saïd since I discovered her during my first year of college three years ago. Her rawness and directness comfort me; she employs common language and a lack of punctuation, which enable the reader to grapple directly with each word on the page. This poem is one of my absolute favorites, for it is easy to fall in love with the first line; the evocative imagery jumps out at the reader, forcing her to come to terms with a violent, self-destructive sun and its rebirth after tragedy each day. This concept forces us to consider the essence of life, of our own regeneration with the coming and going of each day. I chose to translate <i>égorge son spectre</i> as “slits the throat of its former self” instead of “slits the throat of its ghost” in order to convey a sense of rebirth and  regeneration of the sun as its own entity or “former self.” I wanted to delineate the poem’s first line, which also serves as its title, as evocative of the essence of a phoenix being reborn from ashes, and therefore believe the indication of “former self” is necessary in order to distinguish between a sense of the past and of the present.</p>
  <p> With the line “each beginning represents a circle,” I chose to translate the French <em>dessine</em> (“to draw”) in a more symbolic manner in order to underscore the symbolism of a circle as representative of a beginning or of this feeling of rebirth that the first line of the poem conveys. In this manner, I chose the word “possibilities” in lieu of “beginnings” for the French <em>commencements</em> in the following line to emphasize the sense of possibility that is enabled through rebirth, which inherently constitutes a new beginning.</p>
  <p> Saïd shirks off any usage of punctuation or capitalization; it seems that in some portions of the poem, particularly “and what was begins again,” might be better clarified by punctuation. However, I find the beauty in Saïd’s poetry to underscore an ephemerality rooted within words and a constancy lodged within uncertainty. Saïd seems to be telling us that poetry and therefore life cannot be fully understood through generic formulas of punctuation, but rather through endeavoring to unravel the deeper meaning within a collection of words themselves.</p>
  <p>I felt calm when reading the second to last stanza, for I find solace in the repetition of the French word <em>de</em> (“of”) for this repetition suggests the struggle of remembrance, of attempting to uncover past memories which are so inextricably tied to the present and the future that the lines of distinction are blurred. This repetition also mimics Saïd’s signature rambling style, forcing the reader to consider the poem as a stream of consciousness that can apply to any person’s experience of life and of the trials and tribulations involved with love, darkness, and light.</p>
  <p>Saïd juxtaposes notions of “you” with “me” in order to more fully arrive at the idea of an intertwining of souls, yet I believe that the beauty of this poem is more so discovered by ascertaining the connection of the individual self (or selves) with nature. By noting that “we fall in love with the night” and “we fall in love with the day,” she avails us to the beauty of life and the evocations of lightness and darkness imbued within it.</p>
abio: "<p>Born in Tunis in 1953, Amina Saïd was raised bilingual, learning both Arabic
  and French in school and speaking Arabic, the language of her parents, at home.
  After being encouraged by her teacher, she began to write poetry in middle school
  and soon became enamored with the power of the written word to relate essential
  truths of being. She studied English in college and started to publish poetry soon
  after graduation. Saïd made a living as a journalist in France but continued to
  write throughout her life, ultimately publishing her work in numerous poetry collections
  and being considered as a unique voice based on her Tunisian heritage and experimentation
  with form.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Ashley Sniffen is a junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying art
  history and French and Francophone studies. Passionate about art, language, and
  education, she enjoys staring at the paintings hanging on white walls of museums
  and creating events that support artists and cultural institutions. In her spare
  time, she enjoys reading, basking in nature, and watching college basketball games.</p>"
