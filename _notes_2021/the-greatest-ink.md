poem: "Me lo han quitado todo\nlas plumas\nlos lápices\nla tinta\nporque ellos no
  quieren\nque yo escriba\ny me han hundido\nen esta celda de castigo\npero ni así
  ahogarán mi rebeldía.\nMe lo han quitado todo\n— bueno, casi todo —\nporque me queda
  la sonrisa\nel orgullo de sentirme un hombre libre\ny en el alma un jardín\nde eterna
  florecitas.\nMe lo han quitado todo\nlas plumas\nlos lápices\npero me queda la tinta
  de la vida\n— mi propia sangre —\ny con ella escribo versos todavía.\n\n*Original
  escrito con mi sangre y una astillita \nde madera en abril de 1981 en las celdas\nde
  castigo de la Cárcel Combinado del Este, \nen La Habana."
transpoem: "They’ve taken everything from me,\nthe pens, \nthe pencils, \nthe ink,\nbecause
  they don’t want\nme to write,\nand they’ve sunk me down \ndeep in this cell,\nbut
  my rebellion will not drown.\nThey’ve taken everything from me —\nwell, almost everything
  —\nbut here is my smile,\nthe pride of a man set free,\nand in my soul a garden,\nflowering
  eternally.\nThey’ve taken everything from me,\nthe pens, \nthe pencils,\nbut here
  is the ink of life —\nmy own blood —\nand thus I write my verses still.\n\n*Original
  written with my blood and a splinter of wood in April 1981 \nin the cells of the
  East Combined Prison in Havana."
note: "<p>The most striking part of this poem to me is the ending, when we find out
  that the central metaphor is no metaphor at all. Our author takes the well-used
  living-through-writing idea and writes with his actual blood, the only means available
  to him at the time. The second thing that drew me to this poem many years ago when
  I read it in a Spanish class was the beat — of blood? — that moves it along. I attempted
  to match this musicality by adding some rhymes which are not present in the original.
  I also utilized a double meaning in English not present in Spanish: “still” as both
  “even now” and “not moving,” while the original carries only the first connotation.
  This change, I believe, reflects both the message of the poem that imprisonment
  will not defeat the poet and that the act of writing solidifies his resolve and
  preserves it for the future.</p>"
abio: "<p>What little information exists about Armando Valladares on the internet
  is full of contradictions and differing accounts. The facts? He was born in Cuba
  in 1937. He was imprisoned in 1960. He smuggled his poetry that would become the
  1974 collection <em>From My Wheelchair</em> out of jail. He was released from prison
  in 1982 and published a book, <em>Against All Hope</em>, which detailed torture
  at the hands of his guards. He served as the US ambassador to the UN Commission
  on Human Rights from 1988 to 1990. The less-straightforward? I won’t comment on
  the details because they are too numerous and I am not a qualified historian, but
  suffice it to say that some claims made by the Cuban government, the U.S. government,
  and Valladares himself could not be substantiated. All sides have tales they wish
  to tell, whether in good faith or bad, so it’s hard to know what exactly to believe.
  However, I believe Valladares when he said, “Poetry is a weapon.”</p>"
