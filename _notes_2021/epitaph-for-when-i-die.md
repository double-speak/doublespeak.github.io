transtitle: Epitaph For When I Die
title: Epitaphe Quand Je Mourrai
author: Mariama Ndiaye
translator: Donnisa Edmonds
poem: "Quand je mourrai,\nNe pleurez pas\nIl faudra blanchir vos dents\nIl faudra
  prier pour que je vous quitte!\n \nQuand je mourrai,\nJe vous confierai mes enfants,\nApprenez
  leur à lire et à écrire,\nTraduisez leur les chants d'initiés,\nQu’ils se nourrissent
  de rêves et d’idéal,\nQu’ils prennent ma plume que j’ai prise\nLe soin de ne pas
  cacher.\n \nQuand je mourrai,\nPermettez à cette terre de Foundiougne\nDe couver
  mon sommeil éternel\nPriez pour que je demeure la nourrice\nDe ses entrailles.\n
  \nQuand je mourrai\nLisez mes écrits\nNe m’oubliez jamais.\n \nQuand je mourrai,\nVenez
  visiter ma tombe les vendredi, samedi et dimanche\nJe vous demanderai de fêter cet
  anniversaire,\nCe jour où la poétesse a embrassé\nLa fraîcheur de ces ombres éternelles.\n
  \nQuand je mourrai\nNe m’oubliez jamais,\nJe vous dédierai d’autres poèmes dans
  ma tombe\nCar au royaume des cieux je continuerai\nA écrire pour vous."
transpoem: "When I die,\nYou must whiten your teeth,\nYou must pray so that I leave!\n
  \nWhen I die,\nI will entrust to you my children,\nTeach them to read and write,\nShow
  them the songs of the enlightened, \nSo that they nourish themselves with dream
  and goals,\nSo that they take my quill that I prize\nThe care not to hide.\n \nWhen
  I die,\nAllow this earth of Foundiougne\nTo swathe my eternal slumber\nPray so that
  I remain the caretaker\nOf its depths.\n \nWhen I die\nRead my writings\nNever forget
  me.\n \nWhen I die,\nCome to visit my tomb on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays\nI
  will ask you to celebrate this anniversary,\nThis day where the poetess embraced\nThe
  coolness of these eternal shadows.\n \nWhen I die\nNever forget me,\nI will dedicate
  to you the other poems in my tomb\nBecause in the kingdom of heaven I will continue\nTo
  write for you."
note: "<p>Of the few poems I’ve translated in my life, this was definitely the most
  challenging. Ndiaye utilizes a lot of great imagery throughout the poem related
  to being the nurse or caretaker of someone that was difficult to translate directly.
  For example, <em>de couver</em> in the line “de couver mon sommeil éternel” translates
  most directly to “to wrap a child in cotton wool.” I tried to preserve this notion
  through the use of the word “swathe,” which similarly refers to the idea of wrapping
  a baby in fabric. I also struggled with the line “to care not to hide.” This translation
  originally did not make much sense to me within the context of the poem, so I tried
  many different versions and arrangements. However, I continued to come back to this
  most direct translation of Ndiaye’s words. I feel like it allows the most room for
  interpretation of her meaning without my own personal inputs. I maintain her punctuation,
  line breaks, and structure throughout the entire poem, along with the repetition
  of “When I Die.”</p>"
