poem: "戴宽边草帽的瞭望者\n他的可疑的行程    在夏天的北方\n走向高潮    他的忽而被群峰突出\n忽而又被幽暗的峡谷藏匿的行程\n在渐渐靠近沙漠时\n明显地慢下来了
  \       \n\n一边是草原    一边是沙地的情景\n令他迷惑    他看见\n一条河流摇摆着尾巴\n和一条受惊的慌不择路的蜥蜴\n他们结伴而行    消失般地奔赴远处\n\n我是在一辆比河流跑得更快的卡车\n一晃而过时看到瞭望者的
  \   我看到了宽边草帽下\n他的阴影都掩饰不住的迷惑\n和他的在高潮中夹杂着些许落魄\n而忽然停下来的旅程"
transpoem: "The suspicious odyssey of an onlooker \nWearing a broad-brimmed straw
  hat in the northern summer\nIs reaching its climax — sometimes punctuated by peaks\nOtherwise
  concealed by a gloomy canyon —\nAnd is obviously slowing down\nWhile gradually approaching
  a desert\n\nA prairie on one side and a sandy land on the other\nThe views bewilder
  him who also witnesses\nA river wagging its tail and a startled lizard \nToo desperate
  to choose its path\nTravel together, hurriedly vanishing into the distance\n\nIt
  is when a truck faster than a river rushes by\nThat I behold the onlooker, his bewilderment\nUnconcealable
  by the shadow under his broad-brimmed straw hat\nAnd his abruptly stopped journey\nWith
  an apex mingled with slight abjection"

  <p>Yan An’s poems are highly experimental, unconventional, and unique according to the standards and traditions of Chinese culture, considering their aesthetic value, contents, philosophical denotations and meanings. As a pioneer in modern Westernized Chinese poetry, Yan An has completely transformed Chinese readers’ concepts and understanding of poetry through his unique views about the universe, life, society, and people. His way of thinking is unusual and unconventional. His poems do not contain any of the Chinese elements traditionally and commonly depicted by other Chinese poets and even if they do, they are addressed from unique perspectives. Therefore, they can transcend the boundaries between nations and cultures, reaching for a wider audience across the world. In each of his poems, behind his boundless imagination, there lies a story and Yan An’s sentiments and understandings of life, people, society, and the universe.</p>
  <p>His language is intense and abstract. Just like his other poems, these poems are rich in imagery and literary devices, such as metaphor, personification, and parallelism. These literary devices have well served their purpose in the Chinese versions. Nevertheless, in their English versions, some transcreation techniques have to be exploited to retain the same or similar effect.</p>
  <p>For example, the omission and restructuring techniques are combined together in translating the first two lines of the first stanza of the poem “Onlooker.” In particular, “his” is omitted, “wearing a broad-brimmed straw hat” is restructured from the first line to the second line, and “the suspicious odyssey” is restructured from the second line to the third line. Also, the spaces are switched to English conventions to make the translation more elegant. In order to delete some of the spaces, conjunctions are used as in the case of “and” and “who” in the first and second line of the second stanza, respectively.</p>
  <p>All in all, we have attempted to bring something new and foreign into English to enrich it, by helping English poets and readers unleash their creativity, imagination, inspiration, and by bridging or integrating American and Chinese culture and ways of thinking. Also, we have endeavored to create some novel transcreation techniques to help with any future translation of Yan An’s poems.</p>
