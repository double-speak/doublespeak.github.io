author: Carlos de Assumpção
translator: Pedro Lino
poem: "Olho no espelho \nE não me vejo\nNão sou eu \nQuem está la\n\nSenhores\nOnde
  estão meu tambores\nOnde estão meu orixás\nOnde Olórum\nOnde o meu modo de viver\nOnde
  as minhas asas negras e belas\nCom que costuma voar\n\nOlho no espelho\nE não me
  vejo\nNão sou eu \nQuem está lá\n\nSenhores\nQuero de volta\nOs meus tambores\nQuero
  de volta\nOs meus orixás\n\nQuero de volta\nMeu pai Olórum\nEm seu esplendor sem
  par\nQuero de volta\nO meu modo de viver\nQuero de volta\nAs minhas asas negras
  e belas\nCom que costuma voar\n\nOlho no espelho\nE não me vejo\nNão sou eu\nQuem
  está lá\n\nSéculos de destruição\nSob meus ombros cansados\nEstou eu a carregar\nConfuso
  sem norte sem rumo\nPerdido em mim mesmo\nAqui neste lado do mar\n\nUm dia no entanto
  senhores\nEu hei de me reencontrar\n"
transpoem: "I look in the mirror\nAnd I do not see myself\nThat’s not me\nWho’s out
  there\n\nGentlemen, \nWhere are my tambors?\nWhere are my orishas?\nWhere, Olórum?\nWhere
  is my own way of living?\nWhere are my lovely black wings,\nthe ones I used to fly
  with?\n\nI look at the mirror\nAnd I do not see myself \nThat’s not me\nWho’s out
  there?\n\nGentlemen, \nI want it back\nThe tambors of mine\nI want it back\n\nAll
  of my orishas\nI want it all back\nMy father, Olórum\nAnd your unparalleled splendor
  \nI want it back\nMy own way of living\nI want it back\nMy lovely black wings,\nthe
  ones I used to fly with\n\nI look in the mirror\nAnd I do not see myself\nThat’s
  not me\nWho’s out there\n\nCenturies of destruction\nAbove my very weary shoulders\nHere
  am I, disorientated, aimless,\nlost within my own self\nat the seaside\n\nGentlemen!
  Someday, however,\nI hope to find myself once again\n"

  <p>Once Black Lives Matter movements occurred in 2020, I realized I hadn’t yet done anything for the movement itself. As a Black poet myself, I knew I had to make a difference. Thus, this poem seemed to be the ideal way for me to make a personal contribution, given all that was happening in the world.</p>
  <p>“Eclipse” has no punctuation marks at all, mostly due to the fact that Portuguese is a fairly fluid language. Since it is virtually impossible to understand the poem without punctuation marks in English, I did have to include certain commas, exclamation points and question marks to maintain its consistency and create a balance.</p>
  <p>The poem talks about a man who was brought to the Americas as a slave and sought to rediscover his own personality and cultural dignity which was lost to the new way of life imposed upon him. Therefore, it was crucial to retain a questioning tone that reflects his identity, and so I found it important to write down question marks when needed.</p>
  <p>The notions of both hope and despair occur throughout the poem, so adding commas was necessary for the English version, because this juxtaposition is inherent to the message the author wishes to convey.</p>
abio: "<p>Carlos de Assumpção (1927–) is a Brazilian author who mainly writes anti-racist
  poetry that promotes a greater inclusion of Black literature. A grandson of former
  slaves, he has employed literature as a form of activism for nearly seven decades,
  and his words of protest proclaiming racial equality have achieved national recognition.
  Assumpção’s writings evoke a colloquial, yet concrete, vernacular form of speech.</p>"

  <p>Pedro Lino is a senior majoring in history at São Paulo State University, Brazil. He is a true “logophile” (someone who loves words) and a polyglot who doesn’t talk all that often, but sure does translate a lot. Although he occasionally tries to stop writing, he just can’t seem to do so.</p>
  <p>You can find some of Pedro’s poems at <em>eMerge</em>, the magazine of the Writers Colony House at Dairy Hollow.</p>
