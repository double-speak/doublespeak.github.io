poem: |
  Послушайте!
  Ведь, если звезды зажигают —
  значит — это кому-нибудь нужно?
  Значит — кто-то хочет, чтобы они были?
  Значит — кто-то называет эти плевочки
  жемчужиной?
  И, надрываясь
  в метелях полуденной пыли,
  врывается к богу,
  боится, что опоздал,
  плачет,
  целует ему жилистую руку,
  просит —
  чтоб обязательно была звезда! —
  клянется —
  не перенесет эту беззвездную муку!
  А после
  ходит тревожный,
  но спокойный наружно.
  Говорит кому-то:
  “Ведь теперь тебе ничего?
  Не страшно?
  Да?!”
  Послушайте!
  Ведь, если звезды
  зажигают —
  значит — это кому-нибудь нужно?
  Значит — это необходимо,
  чтобы каждый вечер
  над крышами
  загоралась хоть одна звезда?!
  (1914)
transpoem: "Listen!\nAfter all, if the stars are set alight,\ndoes it mean anyone
  needs it?\nDoes it mean someone wants them to be?\nDoes it mean someone is calling
  these spitlets pearls?\nAnd, toiling away\nin the torrents of midday dust,\nhe bursts
  in on God,\nfears that he was late,\ncries,\nkisses his veiny hand,\nasks \nthat
  there must be stars! -\nswears \nhe will not bear this starless torment!\nAnd after,\nhe
  walks about, restless,\nbut outwardly calm.\nSaying to someone:\n‘You don’t have
  anything now, do you?\nYou aren’t scared?\nRight?!’\nListen!\nAfter all, if the
  stars\nare set alight,\ndoes it mean anyone needs it?\nDoes it mean it’s necessary\nthat
  every night,\nabove the roofs,\nat least one star is set ablaze?!\n(1914)\n"

  <li class="note"><span lang= "ru"><em>плевочки</em></span> — A plural, diminutive form of <span lang= "ru"><em>плевок</em></span>, meaning “spit.” Originally, I translated the word as “spittles,” but felt that it was out of place. While somewhat contrived, “spitlets” offered a more robust alternative that could more easily be imagined in individual units.</li>
  <li class="note"><span lang= "ru"><em>жемчужиной</em></span> — In my rough translation, I translated this word as “pearl-like,” but found that it slowed the meter’s momentum. The shift to “pearls” as a subject complement to the direct object, improved fluidity while adding a luster to the otherwise gross imagery of bits of spit. I felt that this was closer to Mayakovsky’s poetic intentions for the phrase.</li>
abio: "<p>Vladimir Mayakovsky — poet, playwright, satirist, revolutionary, and futurist—was
  born in present-day Georgia to a Cossack father of noble descent and a Ukrainian
  mother. Moving to Moscow as a teenager, Mayakovsky was radicalized and joined local
  socialist groups. Following a brief prison sentence, Vladimir distanced himself
  from the Party, focusing instead on his independent socialist education. Mayakovsky
  discovered his literary voice as he became more involved in the Moscow artists’
  circles of the 1910s. He made his name in Futurist literary magazines with early
  poems like “Night” and “Take That!” Mayakovsky played a key role in early Bolshevik
  literature following the October Revolution, supporting socialist ideology not only
  in his writing but also through plays, film, and agitational propaganda. Mayakovsky’s
  <em>Vladimir Ilyich Lenin</em>, a poetic epic in tribute to the vanguard of the
  revolution, was applauded by both the Party and Soviet citizens. After the release
  of two satire pieces in the late 1920s, Vladimir’s relationship with the Party began
  to deteriorate and Soviet media targeted him in media campaigns. Following an argument
  with a romantic partner in 1930, Mayakovsky died of suicide. Mayakovsky’s pioneered
  Futurist and Socialist Realist genres, gaining revered status in the Soviet canon.</p>\n"
