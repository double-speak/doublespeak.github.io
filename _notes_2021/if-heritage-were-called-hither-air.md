title: Wenn Die Herkunft Herluft Hiesse
transtitle: If Heritage Were Called Hither-Air
author: Marica Bodrožić
translator: Qingyang Zhou
poem: "Wenn die Herkunft Herluft hiesse,\nkönnte ich sagen,\nich sei ein Mensch aus
  Wolken, könnte ich sagen,\nich sei ein Gebiet des Wetters und niemand störte\nsich
  an meiner jugoslawischen Geburt, auch ich\nselbst nicht. Mein Wetter wäre jeder
  Tag, wäre\nein Sonnentausch das Einfachste auf der Welt.\nMit den Lungen ginge
  ich auf Andromeda spazieren,\nfüllte die Venus aus mit einem katzengleichen Sprung.\nHer
  Luft!, könnte ich dann sagen und lachen dabei,\nweil das Ernsthafte alt in mir
  geworden ist, ein Zuspieler\nder Wartenden, der da Hockenden, der auf die Grenzöffnungen
  \nHoffenden. Menschen sind mir dabei vertraut geworden, \nimmerhin. Eine ganze Zeit
  lang dachte ich, Menschen\nseien wohl das Letzte, an das ich mich hier auf Erden\ngewöhnen
  könnte. Dabei das Maß der Bäume, immer,\nvor Augen, wie sie Fähige sind, Fähige,
  den Regen \nEmpfangende. An einem Sonntag, es war in der Stadt\nBerlin, es war ein
  Regentag, es war eine eigene Stunde,\nda sah ich den einen Turm von dreizehn volljährigen
  Türmen.\nIch wuchs so aus der Erde heraus und bekam\ndie Gelegenheit zu einer Rede.
  Ich sagte mir selbst,\nwäre ein jeder der Türme aus Licht, ginge die Herkunft\nmich
  wirklich nichts mehr an. Da ich das dachte,\ntönte die solare Quelle sich in meiner
  Küche ein,\nder dreizehnte Turm gab sich zu erkennen. Ich hörte\ndeutlich, wie
  sein Name Wahrheit wurde, meine\nWahrheit, ich übte Verzicht, ich ließ los das
  Gewesene,\nam liebsten hätte ich auch meinen Namen an die\nWache abgegeben, so
  übermütig und froh war ich.\nDer Mann sagte aber, behalte ihn, er wird dir helfen,\ndich
  hier und dort, mit Schuhen oder ohne, mit deinen\nFüßen und der Queste der Seele
  fortzubewegen."
transpoem: "If Heritage were called Hither-Air,\nI could say,\nI was a person of clouds.
  I could say,\nI was a turf of weather and no one was disturbed\nBy my Yugoslavian
  birth, not even \nMyself. Each day would be my weather.\nA change of sunlight would
  be the simplest thing on this world.\nWith the lungs I’d stroll on Andromeda,\nFill
  up Venus with a catlike leap.\nHither, Air! I could then say while laughing,\nSince
  the most serious part of me aged, a playmate\nOf the ones waiting, of the ones crouching,
  of the ones hoping \nFor the borders to open. People became familiar to me,\nAfter
  all. For quite some time, I thought people\nWere perhaps the last thing I would
  be accustomed to\nHere on Earth. While the magnitude of the trees is always\nIn
  my mind, how capable they are, capable, \nOf receiving the rain. On a Sunday, it
  was in the city of \nBerlin, it was a rainy day, it was an hour of its own,\nWhen
  I saw one tower among thirteen full-fledged towers.\nI thus grew out of the Earth
  and received\nThe opportunity for a speech. I said to myself,\nIf each of the towers
  were made of light, the heritage\nWould no longer concern me. As I thought so,\nThe
  sunbeams tinted my kitchen,\nThe thirteenth tower revealed itself. I heard\nClearly,
  how its name became truth, my\nTruth. I relinquish, I let go of what had been.\nPreferably
  I would have given my name\nTo the guard, so jaunty and joyful was I.\nBut the man
  said, keep it, it will help you,\nMove here and there, with shoes or without, with
  your\nFeet and the quest of the soul."
note: |
  <p>Bodrožić’s poem contains plenty of neologisms, which encourage the translator to experiment with the target language and actively interpret the meaning of the poem in order to find the best translation. For instance, the word “Herluft” in the title is entirely the poet’s original creation. I chose to translate it as “Hither-Air” in order to evoke a poetic tone and to create an alliteration with the preceding word, “heritage,” (<em>Herkunft</em>). The word <em>Gebiet</em> in the fourth line can be translated as area, territory, region, zone, domain, or sphere. I initially decided to use “territory,” since the narrator appears to be quite possessive of her heritage. However, in English, “territory” triggers associations with the animal world, which is perhaps not the original intention of the poet. I eventually chose “turf,” since it can be defined as “an area or sphere of activity regarded as someone’s personal territory,” which transitions well into the discussion of the narrator’s Yugoslavian birth in the following line. Bodrožić also describes towers (<em>Türme</em>) as <em>volljährig</em>, which means “full-aged,” “mature,” or “adult,” bestowing human qualities on inanimate objects. The adjective that I chose in the translation, “full-fledged,” can be used to describe both people and objects. This word might sound less strange to English speakers, without deviating too much from the original text.</p>

  <p>Though difficult decisions had to be made in the translation process, the linguistic affinities of English and German can sometimes allow for the transmission of similar tones, feelings, and sensations. One of the most striking features of the poem is the use of the subjunctive mode. My English translation preserves this feature, thus conveying the narrator’s unbounded imaginations and intense longing for the realization of fictional situations. The original German segment of “ein Zuspieler / der Wartenden, der da Hockenden, der auf die Grenzöffnungen / Hoffenden” has a rhythmic flow, since all the short phrases end with <em>en</em>. To create a similar auditory experience in English, I chose to terminate each clause of the translation with <em>ing</em>, even though in German grammar <em>Wartenden</em>, <em>Hockendedn</em>, and <em>Hoffenden</em> all function as adjectives, rather than as verbs.</p>
abio: "<p>Marica Bodrožić is a German writer of Croatian descent. She was born in
  1973 in Svib in former Yugoslavia and immigrated to Hessen, Germany, at age ten.
  Bodrožić began publishing novels and essays in German in 2002, while also working
  as a translator of English literature into Croatian. As a former guest professor
  at Dartmouth College, she taught German poetry from the twentieth century to the
  present. One of her best-known literary works is the novel <em>Kirschholz und alte
  Gefühle</em> (<em>A Cherrywood Table</em>), which received the EU Prize for Literature
  in 2013. Her writing often reminisces her childhood in a socialist country and discusses
  the possibility of personal empowerment through language. Regarding German as her
  “second mother tongue,” Bodrožić frequently strives to transcend linguistic limitations
  through neologism in her poems and novels. In 2007, she co-directed a documentary
  with Katja Gasser, titled <em>Herzgemälde der Erinnerung – Eine Reise durch mein
  Kroatien</em> (<em>Heart Painting of Memory: A Journey through My Croatia</em>).
  Dedicated to eliminating linguistic barriers between member states of the former
  Yugoslavia, Bodrožić signed the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats,
  Serbs, Bosniaks, and Montenegrins in 2017. She currently lives in Berlin.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Qingyang Zhou (Freya) is a PhD candidate in German at UC Berkeley. She graduated
  from Penn in 2020 with a BA in German, comparative literature, and cinema and media
  studies. Originally from Shenzhen, China, Freya is interested in the intersections
  of German-Asian cultures, particularly as they pertain to the collaborations between
  East/West Germany, China/Taiwan, and North/South Korea during the Cold War and beyond.
  She has published academic articles on queer cinema, German and Israeli literature,
  interactions between Jewish refugees and the Chinese in Shanghai during World War
  II, and East German portrayals of China in literary and filmic travelogues.</p>"
