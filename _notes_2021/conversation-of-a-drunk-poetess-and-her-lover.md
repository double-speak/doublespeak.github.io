  <span lang="ru">Разговор
  пьяной поэтессы и ее нового любовника</span>
transtitle: Conversation of a drunk poetess and her lover
author: Yaroslav (Slava) Mogutin
translator: Ryan Hardy
poem: |-
  — деревья вокруг растут,
  а я голая, пьяная, здоровая корова, поэтесса,
  ну что тут поделаешь?!
  сказать тебе мое имя?
  — нет, лучше не надо.
  — захожу в дома, знаешь, благодать такая…
  кругом красные круги, ничего не видно…


  от меня лучи во все стороны…
  я, наверное, святая какая-нибудь?!
  — конечно, ты святая, о чем речь!
  между прочим, тебе телефон из-за меня отключили,
  хотя я никогда его не видел…
  ты в курсе, что телефон твой пиздец совсем, е.т.м.!
  — я святая, святая я!
  — да, да, святая ты...

  Выпавший утром снег
  был первой страницей
  еще не написанных мемуаров
            о больших телах
  заключенных в ограниченные пространства


  Трением ли, теплоизоляцией
  или ощущением потерянности
            и неопределенности
  вызываются приливы крови к вискам?


  Когда теряется элемент выбора
            укладываешься в систему
            и забываешь думать
  наступает Смена Времен Года

  - trees grow all around,
  but I’m a naked, drunken, healthy cow, a poetess,
  well, what are you gonna do?!
  should I tell you my name?
  - no, you better not.
  - i’ll swing by houses, you know, to sort of grace them…
  red circles are all around, can’t see anything at all…

  beams of light come from me, going in all directions…
  maybe i’m some sort of saint?!
  - of course, you’re a saint, without a doubt!
  by the way, your phone line was cut off ’cause of me,
  even though i’d never even seen it…
  you know, your phone is a total piece of shit, you motherfucker!
  - i’m a saint, a saint!
  - yes, yes, a saint you are…

  Snow, having fallen in the morning,
  was the first page
  of memoirs yet to be written
            about big bodies
  imprisoned in a confined space

  Is it through friction, insulation,
  or a feeling of being adrift,
            of uncertainty
  that rushes of blood are driven to the temples?

  When the element of choice is lost,
            you fit into the system
            and forget to think
  the season’s change is coming.
note: |-
  <p>I began with a literal translation of the poem, ignoring word order and providing several translations of the same words to choose from later. Next, I formatted lines to match the original poem. Before moving onto polishing, I also identified turns of phrase that would need more time and thought to accurately incorporate into a final product. In polishing my rough translation of Mogutin’s poem, I began by adjusting word order to best match the point of syllabic emphasis in each clause, while with Mayakovsky’s I focused more on the emotions behind the poem. I then moved to honing in on word choices, leaving notes that indicated desired sentiment where I was still unsure of what I wanted to highlight. Next, I read through, thoughtfully evaluating and altering verb choices based on verbal aspect and active-passive voice within the clause. Lastly, I reviewed capitalization, punctuation, and line breaks to best match the original. A series of more detailed notes regarding stylistic choices in my translation are listed below:</p>
  <ul class="note"><strong>“Conversation of a drunk poetess and her new lover”:</strong></ul>
  <li class="note"><span lang= "ru"><em>захожу в дома</em></span> — To maintain the poetess’ conversational tone, I translated the prefix <span lang= "ru"><em>за-</em></span> as indicative of fleeting entrances, in which “I swing by” felt more appropriate.</li>
  <li class="note"><span lang= "ru"><em>благодать такая</em></span> —  <span lang= "ru"><em>Такая</em></span> indicates a conversational ellipsis and buffer around the verb. I added “sort of” to add a brief pause to the line and slightly dampen the verb’s delivery.</li>
  <li class="note"><span lang= "ru"><em>от меня лучи во все стороны</em></span> — “Beams” highlighted the emanating light of a saintly glow. I added “of light” to ensure readers wouldn’t picture large beams of wood protruding from the poetess. I inserted “going” into my translation of <span lang= "ru"><em>во все стороны</em></span> to highlight the outward movement indicated by the accusative case while maintaining a similar meter.</li>
  <li class="note"><span lang= "ru"><em>между прочим, тебе телефон из-за меня отключили</em></span> — I originally translated this section as “it was cause of me that your phone line / was cut off.” I moved “cause of me” to the second line to improve the flow of the first. I also shortened “because" to “cause,” to soften the point of emphasis on “me” in the sentence.</li>
  <li class="note"><span lang= "ru"><em>телефон твой пиздец совсем, е.т.м.!</em></span> — I was struck by the sudden heatedness of this line and hoped to highlight it. I considered “your phone is totally fucked up,” but didn’t want the line sounding redundant when paired with the <span lang= "ru"><em>е.т.м.!</em></span> (“fuck your mother”). Given the wide range of meanings for <span lang= "ru"><em>пиздец</em></span>, “your phone is a total piece of shit, you motherfucker” fit the build and tone of the line best.</li>

  <p>Slava Mogutin, born in Kemerovo, Siberia, in 1974, is a New York-based artist, writer, and social activist. Slava’s career began with writing for independent newspapers and media outlets in Moscow. Son of Soviet poet and novelist Yuri Mogutin, Slava’s background in writing proved useful as he forged his career in journalism. His 1994 staged registry for a same-sex marraige liscence with his partner Robert Filipinni drew media attention as the first of its kind in the Russian Federation, but was rejected following a failed referendum of a 1969 Soviet law defining marriage as “a voluntary union between a man and woman.” Ensuing police harassment and another charge for “inflaming national, social, and religious division” motivated his subsequent immigration to New York.</p>
          <p>Mogutin’s writing centers themes of queerness and masculinity, and is heavily influenced by his experiences as an immigrant and dissident. His poems confront societal norms unabashedly. In New York, Slava continues to publish his work. His publications include titles in Russian, translations of Allen Ginsberg, monographs, essays, poems, and prose. Mogutin is the winner of the Andrey Bely Prize, and his writing and photography have been featured in publications worldwide, including the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Stern</i>, <i>Flash Art</i>, <i>Libération</i>, and the <i>Calvert Journal</i>.</p>
  <p>Vladimir Mayakovsky—poet, playwright, satirist, revolutionary, and futurist — was born in present-day Georgia to a Cossack father of noble descent and a Ukrainian mother. Moving to Moscow as a teenager, Mayakovsky was radicalized and joined local socialist groups. Following a brief prison sentence, Vladimir distanced himself from the Party, focusing instead on his independent socialist education. Mayakovsky discovered his literary voice as he became more involved in the Moscow artists’ circles of the 1910s. He made his name in Futurist literary magazines with early poems like “Night” and “Take That!” Mayakovsky played a key role in early Bolshevik literature following the October Revolution, supporting socialist ideology not only in his writing but also through plays, film, and agitational propaganda. Mayakovsky’s <em>Vladimir Ilyich Lenin</em>, a poetic epic in tribute to the vanguard of the revolution, was applauded by both the Party and Soviet citizens. After the release of two satire pieces in the late 1920s, Vladimir’s relationship with the Party began to deteriorate and Soviet media targeted him in media campaigns. Following an argument with a romantic partner in 1930, Mayakovsky died of suicide. Mayakovsky’s pioneered Futurist and Socialist Realist genres, gaining revered status in the Soviet canon.</p>
