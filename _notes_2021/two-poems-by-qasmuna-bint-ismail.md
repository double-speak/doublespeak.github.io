title: Two Poems by Qasmūna bint Ismāʿil
author: Qasmūna bint Ismāʿil
translator: 'Maria Dahvana Headley '
poem: "I.\nYā ẓabyatan tarʿa bi-rawdin dāʾiman\ninnī ḥakaitu-ki fi-ttawaḥḥushi wa-l-ḥawari.\nAmsâ
  kilā-nā mufradan ʿan ṣāḥibin\nfa-ʿitābu-nā abadan ʿalâ ḥukmi-l-qadari\n\nII. \nAyā

  asafī yamdī-shshabābu mudayyaʿan\nwa-yabqâ-lladhī mā lanʾusammī-hi mufradā"
transpoem: "I. \nO gazelle, tasting leaves,\nhere in the green of my garden.\nLook
  at my eyes. Dark and lonely,\njust as yours are. \nHow distant we are from our beloveds,
  and how forgotten\nStanding in the night,\nWaiting for fate to find us.\n\nII.\nThe
  garden is filled with fruit on the vines, but the gardener\r\nrefuses to brush a
  finger over the skin of even one piece.\r\nHow sad it is! The season of splendor
  passes,\r\nand the fruit that ripens only in darkness\r\nRemains lonely. "
note: <span lang= "{{ item.lang }}" dir="ltr"><p>These two poems were written by the
  eleventh-century Iberian Jewish poet Qasmūna bint Ismāʿil. Very little is known
  about her, and only a few poems survive, written in Arabic. For these translations,
  which were included in my 2017 story “The Orange Tree” about a female wooden golem
  and the poet who commissions her to be built, I did literal translations and then
  played with them. The story was in the <em>Best American Fantasy and Science Fiction</em>
  volume edited by N.K. Jemisin.</p></span>
