transpoem: "I. \nO gazelle, tasting leaves,\nhere in the green of my garden.\nLook
  at my eyes. Dark and lonely,\njust as yours are. \nHow distant we are from our beloveds,
  and how forgotten\nStanding in the night,\nWaiting for fate to find us.\n\nII.\nThe
  garden is filled with fruit on the vines, but the gardener\nrefuses to brush a finger
  over the skin of even one piece.\nHow sad it is! The season of splendor passes,\nand
  the fruit that ripens only in darkness\nRemains lonely. "
note: "<p>These two poems were written by the eleventh-century Iberian Jewish poet
  Qasmūna bint Ismā‘il. Very little is known about her, and only a few poems survive,
  written in Arabic. For these translations, which were included in my 2017 story,
  “The Orange Tree,” about a female wooden golem and the poet who commissions her
  to be built, I did literal translations and then played with them. The story was
  in the Best American Fantasy and Science Fiction volume edited by N.K. Jemisin.</p>"
abio: "<p>Qasmūna bint Ismāʿil sometimes called Xemone, was an Iberian Jewish poet.
  She is the only female Arabic-language Jewish poet attested from medieval Andalusia,
  and, along with Sarah of Yemen and the anonymous wife of Dunash ben Labrat, one
  of few known female Jewish poets throughout the Middle Ages.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Maria Dahvana Headley is an American novelist, memoirist, editor, translator,
  poet, and playwright. Her work includes Magonia, a young-adult space-fantasy novel,
  Queen of Kings, an alternate-history fantasy novel about Cleopatra, and The Mere
  Wife, a retelling of Beowulf.</p>"
