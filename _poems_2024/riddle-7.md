transpoem: "Days like this they leave me for dead,\nmother and father both. \nWhat
  life was in me yet? \n\t— What spirit within?\n\nAt some point, some woman\nroused
  my life in her aprons,\nsuch a gracious step-mother,\nkeeping me and preserving
  me,\nsnarled up in sweet snares —\njust like her own children.\n\nUntil my nature
  was known\nunder her swaddling \nwhile I swelled with life \namongst my unsiblings,\nmy
  sheltering step-mom \nschooling me all the while,\nuntil I waxed into fullness,\nable
  to rove my riddling \nalong these wider ways.\n\nPoor her, the more \nshe lavished
  her love,\nthe fewer she had — her dear ones,\nsons and daughters both."
note: |-
  <p>Nowhere else in the extant Old English corpus is the need for non-conforming, deviant, and Queer translation more urgently felt than in the “Exeter Book Riddles”. These voices repeatedly insist that they are “amazing” (<em>wundorlīcu</em>) and “fascinating” (<em>wrætlīc</em>), yet it is quite easy to fail to clock their extravagance in how they are usually rendered. My translations endeavor to re-estrange these poems, breaking down critical complacencies regarding them. I work to vibe with their voices — to follow the weird wendings of their language, to stay awake to their glitches and hiccups, and most of all to listen to their expressive capacities. Nonconforming identities, desires, and experiences are often awkward to state aloud and therefore are easily spoken over, and so the riddles often give voice to the voiceless, not only to objects or animals but also to those otherwise invisible socially.</p>
  <p>The question of stranger and kinsfolk is central to “Riddle 7,” usually solved as “Cuckoo” — a macabre story of nature sometimes used as a warning against fostering another’s children (this is a sub-plot of <em>Beowulf</em>, for instance). Yet the text of this poem resists that interpretation: the manuscript reading <em>snārlīce swā</em> [literally “like a snare”; here perhaps, “deviously”] is conventionally emended to <em>swā ārlīce swā</em> [“as graciously as”], which casts the step-mother as noble victim of this interloper. My translation opens up further possibilities of interpretation by refusing to take sides and suggests other motivations for taking in children: hostage-taking; enslavement; even placement in a monastery.</p>
  <p>Just above “Riddle 15” in the <em>Exeter Book</em>, the runic characters “Beorc” and “Lagu” can be found, possibly pointing to a solution containing the letters “B” and “L”. It was frequent to assume this poem was solved by “ballista” or “fortified town” — those letters, however, may be more convincingly read as <em>bēo-loca</em>: a “bees’ horde” or beehive. For this translation I chose a style derived from hip-hop verse, four beats per line, with an internal rhyme. In doing this, I open the possibility of a new voice in the poem: a poet grappling with their own potential for violence. Filled with sweetness, defended by the points of spears, this speaker bears a striking resemblance to the narrators created by Biggie Smalls or the Geto Boys.</p>
  <p>The proximity of a riddle to its solution is often found reassuring, but what if there is none apparent? What if there’s no need for one? “Riddle 26” is one of just a few poems like this in the collection; its dazzle of rhyming, chiming sound-play has eluded scholars since the nineteenth century. Previous solutions seek to harness this aural profligacy to the process of craft — making beer or a manuscript book. But what if this wallowing in the fun actually goes nowhere? What if these pleasures are non-productive, self-contained, private — unnecessary to interpret?</p>
abio: "<p>The “Exeter Book Riddles” are found in an Old English miscellany produced
  between 950–1000 CE, now housed at Exeter Cathedral Library. Few of these riddles,
  if any, were produced by the same hand, and the idea of an “author” may not even
  be particularly relevant to its immediate audiences, making these crafty jewels
  difficult to contextualize in ways that modern scholarship finds reassuring. Unlike
  extant Anglo-Latin riddles, these poems do not include solutions, and many of the
  answers suggested by scholars are highly speculative and much-debated. Most likely
  the <em>Exeter Book</em> was produced in a monastery and many of its contents are
  religious in nature, making these determinedly material and quotidian expressions
  stand out even more. Other than that, it’s tough to tell what purpose they served
  or how they were meant to be used or enjoyed.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Ophelia Eryn Hostetter (they/them) is an Associate Professor at Rutgers
  University-Camden, specializing in Old and Middle English Literature. They are the
  host and translator of the <em>Old English Poetry Project</em>, which contains verse
  translations of about 29,000 lines of OE poetry (out of ~32,000 extant). Their latest
  project, <em>Old English Translation Beyond the Horizon</em>, explores how cultural
  and academic nostalgia in early English studies has throttled innovation and inclusivity
  in early English studies. Dr. Hostetter offers a way past this inertia by mobilizing
  Queer Translation tactics that open new possibilities for discovery in this archive
  by way of digital media studies, New Materialisms and affect theory, Queer, feminist
  and Trans studies, hip-hop poetics, and translation theory, as well as manuscript
  studies and linguistic study.</p>"
