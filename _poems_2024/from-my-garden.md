poem: "Me pides sampaguitas... No te envío, \nporque, al ir a cortarlas de la rama,
  \nsentí temblar mis manos y mi pecho \nprensado por la lástima. \n\nNo quiero que
  padezcan esas flores, \ncomo padece, lejos de tí, mi alma, \nno quiero que al contacto
  de mis manos \nperezcan marchitadas. \n\n¡Qué caigan ellas solas! Yo, que siento
  \nmás que nunca mortíferas nostalgias, \nno quiero que por mí tengan las flores
  \nnostalgia de las ramas. \n\nEs crueldad separarlas de sus tallos \nantes que lo
  haga el soplo de las áuras \n¡quién sabe si en las horas más de vida \nque se irán
  al troncharlas, \n\nellas esparcirán en el ambiente \nla esencia más sabrosa y delicada
  \nque formada con mieles de rocío \nen sus corolas guardan! \n\nDeja que vivan.
  A nosotros mismos, \na pesar de seguir nuestra jornada, \nmarchando sobre espinas
  y entre sombras \nla vida nos es grata. \n\nNada tememos más sino la muerte... \n¿Y
  si tuvieran esas flores alma? \n¡Quién sabe si sintieran asimismo \ntemor de verse
  lacias!\n\nNo; déjalas vivir. Que vivan siempre \nen su palacio de hojas y de ramas;
  \nque las encuentre allí la mariposa, \nsu eterna enamorada; \n\nque saluden los
  ocres de la tarde, \nque esplendan con las púrpuras del alba, \nque beban del rocío
  de las noches \ny halaguen las miradas. \n\nLas pobres sampaguitas se resienten
  \ncuando alguien de su tallo las separa; \nal hallarse en el pecho o en las trenzas,
  \nsufren; se tornan pálidas. \n\nY cuando están así ¿qué hombre puede \ncontener
  de los ojos una lágrima? \n¿Quién no se acuerda de los tristes seres \nque mueren
  de nostalgia? "
transpoem: "You ask me for sampaguitas… I will not surrender them to you\nbecause,
  in trying to cut them from the branch, \nI felt my hands tremble \nand my chest
  tighten from shame. \n\nI do not want these flowers to suffer as my soul, \nfar
  away from you, suffers.\nI do not want them \nto wither and perish at the touch
  of my hands. \n\nHow they might die alone! I, who feel relentless nostalgia \nnow
  more than ever, \ndo not want these flowers to feel nostalgia \nfor their branches
  because of me. \n\nIt is cruel to sever them from their stems \nbefore the spirits
  of the wind deem it time. \nWho knows if in the last hours of life,\nthey will put
  an end to them, \n\nThey will scatter into the atmosphere \ntheir sweetest and most
  delicate essence \nformed with dewdrops of honey \nthat their petals earnestly protect!
  \n\nLet them live. For us, \nin spite of following our day’s journey, \nmarching
  on thorns and between shadows, \nlife is pleasant to us. \n\nNothing frightens us
  more than death… \nAnd if these flowers were to have a soul? \nWho knows if they
  might feel the same \nfear of seeing themselves wilted. \n\nNo; let them live. May
  they live always \nin their palace of leaves and branches; \nmay a butterfly, their
  eternal lover, \nfind them there; \n\nmay they greet the ochers of autumn, \nmay
  they shine with the purple hues of daybreak, \nmay they drink from the nighttime
  dew \nand flatter the eyes. \n\nThe poor sampaguitas ache \nwhen someone plucks
  them from their stem; \nupon discovering their chest or tresses, \nthey suffer;
  they lose their brilliance. \n\nAnd when they are like this, what man can \ncontain
  a single tear? \nWho does not remember the sorrowful beings \nwho die of nostalgia? "

  <p>At first glance, Palma’s work is a lyrical ode to the humble and beautiful sampaguita flower, which is a national symbol of the Philippines. The sampaguita, derived from the Filipino phrase <em>sumpa kita</em> or “I promise you,” symbolizes innocence, loyalty, and hope. Bearing this symbolism in mind, I also focused on Palma’s political views during the movement for Philippine independence. Knowing Filipinos’ struggle for autonomy largely shaped how I chose to translate this poem. Just as the author spoke about nostalgia for one’s homeland, I used my memories from my grandparents’ home in the Philippines to determine the word choice and tone of my translation.</p>
  <p>It is crucial to recognize that Palma wrote this poem in 1900, two years after the United States began its occupation of the country, following the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Revolution. Considering his political motives and occupation as a soldier, I was very deliberate about how I wanted to translate the introductory line of the first stanza: “me pides sampaguitas…no te envío”. In Spanish <em>enviar</em> elicits a passive image of sending the flowers without a fight. However, I took <em>enviar</em> to mean “surrender.” Placing more value on the flowers and their agency, I translated the line as: “You ask me for sampaguita flowers…I will not surrender them to you.” This word choice highlights the struggle for land ownership and portrays Filipinos as strong, moral, and heroic like Palma might have intended.</p>
  <p>The image of the sampaguita guided me in prioritizing Palma’s loving and protective tone over any particular rhyme scheme. To conserve the poem’s emotion, I adapted some of the descriptions in English. I translated <em>sabrosa</em> in the fifth stanza as “sweet” and “se tornan pálida” in the tenth stanza as “they lose their brilliance” to signify that the white flowers lose their vividness once they are picked from the branches. Throughout my translation process, the connection between sampaguitas and Filipinos became increasingly clearer. After many drafts of attempting to see the flowers as an extension of humanity (beyond personification), I chose my diction based on how I would write an obituary for a human being. The flowers are not simply plucked from their stem but violently stolen and killed by imperial powers: “que se irán al troncharlas” – “they will put an end to them.”</p>

  <p>José Palma y Velásquez was an author of hispanofilipino literature born in Manila, Philippines in 1876 under Spanish colonial rule. He was the younger brother of acclaimed senator, journalist, and scholar Rafael Palma. The two brothers collaborated extensively in Philippine revolutionary journalism. In fact, it was in journalism where José Palma’s work began. As a staff writer for <em>La Independencia</em>, one of the most notable newspapers published at the time of the Philippine Revolution, he debuted his poem “Filipinas” which are the lyrics to the country’s national anthem. This work has been translated into various Filipino languages and English.</p>
  <p>A dedicated revolutionary, he fought for Filipino political and cultural autonomy during the Spanish-American War. As a soldier of the Katipunan (a group of Filipino nationalists who advocated for armed resistance against the Spanish government), he advocated for independence against the Americans. Inspired by the natural beauty of the Philippine landscape, particularly flora, he wrote poems and music to raise morale and bring awareness to the resilience of Filipino people. Under pseudonyms, he shared these works in publications like <em>El Renacimiento, La Patria</em>, and <em>La Moda Filipina</em>. He died tragically young in 1903, at the age of twenty-six.</p>
