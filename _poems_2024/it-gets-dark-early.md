transtitle: It Gets Dark Early
author: Francesco Tomada
translator: Anna Aresi
poem: |-
  Il tavolo con i piatti sporchi della cena
  una bottiglia di vino bevuta a metà
  e io penso a quando giuravamo
  di restare insieme per sempre
                             abbiamo mentito
                             l’eternità non esiste
  amare è un verbo che ha senso soltanto al presente
  così prima che tu possa sparecchiare
  allungo la mano per stringere la tua
  come i bambini che non vogliono dormire
                             perché hanno paura
                             di non svegliarsi più
transpoem: "Dinner’s dirty dishes on the table\na half-drunk bottle of wine\nand I
  think of when we used to swear\nto stay together forever\n                          we
  lied\n                          eternity does not exist\nthe verb “to love” makes
  sense only in the present \nand so before you can clean up\nI reach my hand out
  to yours\nlike children who don’t want to sleep\n                          for fear\n
  \                         of never waking up"
note: |-
  <p><em>Affrontare la gioia da soli (Facing Joy Alone)</em> is Francesco Tomada’s latest collection. This book, I believe, is meant to be enjoyed as a whole. Each poem is like a star in a constellation: you can look at one star and enjoy its beauty, but the bigger picture can be seen only when taking in the whole constellation. Each poem captures a moment, often seemingly insignificant, and together with all the other moments they make up a life and the search for meaning in it. Many texts also contain a revelation, a moment that illuminates the situation and propels further reflection and/or action. For these reasons, it was difficult to make a selection from the book. I feared that by plucking a few texts out of the whole, they would not be as meaningful and enjoyable. Eventually, I settled for these two, which well exemplify the spirit of <em>Facing Joy Alone</em>.</p>
  <p>In “That Original Marines T-Shirt”, the poet sees himself mirrored in another: a refugee, an illegal outcast, is wearing the shirt that the poet donated to the Catholic charity Caritas. This person is in a group of people and looks happy, laughing and joking with his friends. He looks like the poet — wearing the poet’s old clothes — but is at the same time very different because of his happiness: “another me / but happy.” The poem closes, however, on an optimistic note, with the realization that this refugee is showing the poet who he can become.</p>
  <p>“It Gets Dark Early” depicts a domestic scene that feels tired from the outset: what is left of dinner — dirty dishes and half-drunk bottles — represent what is left of the couple’s love, a lie compared to the promises they used to make to each other. A revelation (“we lied”) propels a realization (“the verb to love makes sense only in the present (tense)”) and an action that contains a seed of hope (“I reach my hand out”).</p>
