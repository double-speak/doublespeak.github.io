author: Alejandra Pizarnik
translator: Mariana Martinez
poem: "Señor \nLa jaula se ha vuelto pájaro \ny se ha volado \ny mi corazón está loco
  \nporque aúlla a la muerte \ny sonríe detrás del viento \na mis delirios \n\nQué
  haré con el miedo \nQué haré con el miedo \n\nYa no baila la luz en mi sonrisa \nni
  las estaciones queman palomas en mis ideas \nMis manos se han desnudado \ny se han
  ido donde la muerte \nenseña a vivir a los muertos \n\nSeñor \nEl aire me castiga
  el ser \nDetrás del aire hay monstruos \nque beben de mi sangre \n\nEs el desastre
  \nEs la hora del vacío no vacío \nEs el instante de poner cerrojo a los labios \noír
  a los condenados gritar \ncontemplar a cada uno de mis nombres \nahorcados en la
  nada. \n\nSeñor \nTengo veinte años \nTambién mis ojos tienen veinte años \ny sin
  embargo no dicen nada \n\nSeñor \nHe consumado mi vida en un instante \nLa última
  inocencia estalló \nAhora es nunca o jamás \no simplemente fue \n\n¿Cómo no me suicido
  frente a un espejo \ny desaparezco para reaparecer en el mar \ndonde un gran barco
  me esperaría \ncon las luces encendidas? \n\n¿Cómo no me extraigo las venas \ny
  hago con ellas una escala \npara huir al otro lado de la noche?\nEl principio ha
  dado a luz el final \nTodo continuará igual \nLas sonrisas gastadas \nEl interés
  interesado \nLas preguntas de piedra en piedra \nLas gesticulaciones que remedan
  amor Todo continuará igual \n\nPero mis brazos insisten en abrazar al mundo porque
  aún no les enseñaron \nque ya es demasiado tarde \n\nSeñor \nArroja los féretros
  de mi sangre \n\nRecuerdo mi niñez \ncuando yo era una anciana \nLas flores morían
  en mis manos \nporque la danza salvaje de la alegría les destruía el corazón \n\nRecuerdo
  las negras mañanas de sol cuando era niña \nes decir ayer \nes decir hace siglos
  \n\nSeñor \nLa jaula se ha vuelto pájaro \ny ha devorado mis esperanzas \n\nSeñor
  \nLa jaula se ha vuelto pájaro \nQué haré con el miedo"
transpoem: "Lord \nThe cage has ripened into a bird \nand it has fled \nand my heart
  has gone mad \nbecause it howls at death \nand smiles behind the wind \nto my ravings
  \n\nWhat shall I do with this fear? \nWhat shall I do with this fear? \n\nLight
  doesn’t dance upon my smile anymore \nand the seasons no longer burn doves into
  my thoughts My hands have been undressed \nand they have gone to where death \nteaches
  the dead how to live \n\nLord \nAir punishes my being \nBehind the air there are
  monsters \ndrinking from my blood \n\nIt’s a disaster \nIt’s time of the emptiness
  not void \nIt’s time to lock the lips \nlisten to the doomed scream \nmuse on each
  one of my names \nhung in oblivion \n\nLord \nI am twenty years old \nAnd so are
  my eyes \nand yet, they say nothing \n\nLord \nI have accomplished my life in but
  an instant \nThe last of my innocence has shattered\nNow it’s never or nevermore
  \nor maybe it just was \n\nHow do I not kill myself in front of a mirror and vanish
  only to resurface in the sea where a vessel waits for me \nwith the lights on? \n\nHow
  do I not dig out my veins \nand craft them into a ladder \nto flee to the other
  side of the night? \n\nThe beginning has given birth to the end Everything will
  stay the same \nThe worn out smiles \nThe interested interest \nQuestions cobblestone
  after cobblestone\nThe gestures that mimic love \nEverything will stay the same
  \n\nBut my arms insist on embracing the world because still no one has taught them\nthat
  it’s now too late \n\nLord \nHurl the coffins of my blood \n\nI remember my childhood
  \nwhen I was an old woman \nThe flowers would die in my hands because the wild dance
  of joy \nwould shatter their hearts \n\nI remember the black mornings of sun when
  I was a little girl \nthat is yesterday \nthat is centuries ago \n\nLord \nThe cage
  ripened into a bird \nand devoured my hopes\nLord \nThe cage ripened into a bird
  What shall I do with this fear"

  <p>Moving into college meant I was forced to leave my Pizarnik anthology behind. Surprisingly scarce, Pizarnik translations in the States excluded most of her earlier gems. My translation stemmed from the desire to share Pizarnik's early brilliance with the English-speaking world.</p>
  <p>I started by doing a literal translation using my knowledge as a native Spanish speaker. However, to achieve my goal I felt the need to take some liberties to evoke the irreversible nature of maturing, a central theme of the poem. Unlike some unofficial translations that used the words “Sir” or “Master” for the repeating verse, I chose the word “Lord” because I wanted the poem to read like a prayer. I also went for a bolder choice in the verse(s) “la jaula se ha vuelto pájaro,” as I didn’t choose “turn” or “twist” for the verb but “ripen” which emphasizes the idea of maturing.</p>
  <p>Wanting to make this translation all about maturing, I manipulated verb tenses to evoke an awakening throughout the poem. I prioritized the use of the past perfect in the first half of the poem to create the nostalgic sense of something once vibrant and existing, now gone. The climatic stanzas eight and nine maintain instead a blunt simple present to show the shift from reminiscing and nostalgia to acceptance and action taking.</p>
  <p>After the climax, once again the poem seems to change and the speaker remembers the past, but without yearning, which is why for this last part I chose to use the past simple. I used this most vigorously in the last two stanzas where I used “ripe” in the past simple. I loved compromising with the idea that indeed the bird ripened into a cage, but it no longer matters that it was a bird once, because all there is now is a cage.</p>
  <p>All in all, my choices in this translation not only aimed for linguistic accuracy but to create an emotional weight, so the English readers would feel Pizarnik’s prayer as intensely as I did in Spanish.</p>
abio: "<p>Alejandra Pizarnik (1936–1972) was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina to the
  tumultuous life of an exiled Jewish family during WW2. Constantly grappling with
  a sense of alienation and comparisons with her sister, she turned to the works of
  Joyce, Rimbaud, Baudelaire, and other surrealists for comfort. Her fascination with
  psychoanalysis, existentialism, and death infused her poetry with a visceral voice,
  delving into themes such as childhood, nostalgia, exile, and the impossibility of
  language to accurately express reality, madness, and fear.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Mariana Martinez is a Penn English and Classical Studies student. She has
  loved reading for as long as she can remember. Like many of her favorite authors,
  she is concerned about the use of language as a resource to give and take away power.
  Translating has recently become a new passion, as she sees it as an arena to explore
  and push against the limitations and extents of language. In her free time Mariana
  loves to write poetry, go out for food, and listen to music.</p>\n"
