title: Le forme della polvere
transtitle: The Shapes of Dust
author: Sebastiano Addamo
translator: Alex Hoffmann
poem: "Tutto ormai noto: l'amore\r\ne lo scempio, le ferite, il pane\r\ne i vermi
  sinuosi come rimorsi,\r\ni treni senza meta volubili per la \r\ncollina come lunatici,
  come soldati\r\nperduti dietro il loro pallore.\r\nSu e giù per corsie d'ospedali\r\nfendere
  lo spazioso tempio\r\ndel crepuscolo senza luce\r\ni paradigmi ossuti e l'oscura\r\nmestizia
  della speranza.\r\nDal treno scendono gai cadaveri\r\ncon grida e bandiere ne cercano\r\naltri
  sotto il cielo\r\nrosso di rose rosse\r\nnella festa di rose rosse\r\nnella festa
  di tempie arrossate.\r\nSotto il vento rose tempie e bandiere\r\nsi tuffano tra
  l'erba bassa.\r\nSi sognano genesi e parabole\r\nin muti colloqui come preghiere.\r\n\r\nE
  io per me.\r\nPer me lascio i miei dèi inetti e testardi\r\nbrucio vecchie (e nuove)
  domande\r\nmi ristendo sotto l'opaca quercia\r\ndella terra nella luna furiosa,\r\nper
  ritrovar soltanto (ma è tutto)\r\nun cane oscuro in cerca d'altri occhi."
transpoem: "All well known by now: love\r\nand ruin, the wounds, the bread\r\nand
  the sinuous worms like regrets,\r\nthe trains without destinations inconstant through
  \r\nthe hill like lunatics, like soldiers\r\nlost behind their pallor.\r\nUp and
  down through hospital wards\r\nto rend the spacious temple\r\nof the lightless crepuscule
  \r\nthe ossified paradigms and the dark\r\nforlornness of hope.\r\nFrom the train
  descend gay cadavers\r\nWith screams and flags they search\r\nfor more under the
  sky\r\nred with rosy roses\r\nin the fête of rosy roses\r\nin the fête of rosied
  temples.\r\nIn the wind roses temples and flags\r\nplunge into the low grass.\r\nThey
  dream of genesis and parables\r\nin mute colloquies like prayers.\r\n\r\nAnd I on
  my own. \r\nOn my own I leave my inept and stubborn gods\r\nburn old (and new) requests\r\nI
  lie down under the dark oak\r\nof the earth in the furious moon\r\nto refind merely
  (but it’s everything)\r\na lowly dog in search of other eyes."
note: "<p>It is my preference when translating poetry to stray as little as possible
  from the original text. I prefer to use a word like “crepuscule” instead of the
  more common “twilight,” for example, in order to remain in closer proximity to the
  Italian <em>crepusculo</em>. This task is made more difficult by a poet like Addamo,
  however, who often uses word play to evoke double meanings. The poet uses the adjective
  <em>oscuro</em> to describe the dog, for example, a word that contains many meanings
  — unknown or dark or even humble (one synonym for <em>oscuro</em> being <em>umile</em>,
  as in “humble origins”). I chose “lowly” because it has the potential to evoke a
  plurality of meanings, while also retaining a more tragic tenor and avoiding the
  comic effect of the alliterative “dark dog.” A more evasive double meaning occurs
  when Addamo uses the phrase <em>mestizia speranza</em>. This could be translated
  as “sad hope”, or “melancholy hope”, but “forlorn hope” turns out to be a phrase
  (originally Dutch) that refers to a group of soldiers deployed on a dangerous mission.
  I chose “forlorn” in order both to retain a potential second meaning and also to
  mirror the earlier image of the pale soldiers, an echo that seemed to fit well in
  this poem, which I read as a reflection of the poet’s own lost illusions in contrast
  with the mindless enthusiasm of the collective.</p>"
abio: "<p>Addamo was a twentieth-century Sicilian writer and poet. The Italian playwright
  and critic Massimiliano Perrota once summed it up well: “Lover of synthesis and
  short forms, in his verses [Addamo] sang the bad mood, the bitterness, the fury
  of those who yearn for some kind of clarity, and end up finding only negative truths…”</p>"
tbio: "<p>Alexander Hoffman is a PhD candidate in comparative literature (with a specialization
  in Italian) at the Graduate Center in New York interested in the poetics of pessimism.</p>"
