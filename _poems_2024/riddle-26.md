author: 'The Exeter Book Riddles '
translator: Ophelia Eryn Hostetter
poem: "Biþ foldan dǣl fægre gegierwed\r\nmid þȳ heardestan ond mid þȳ scearpestan\r\nond
  mid þȳ grymmestan gumena gestrēona,\r\ncorfen, sworfen, cyrred, þyrred,\r\nbunden,
  wunden, blǣced, wǣced,\r\nfrætwed, geatwed, feorran lǣded\r\ntō dūrum dryhta. Drēam
  bið in innan\r\ncwicra wihta, clengeð, lengeð,\r\nþāra þe ǣr lifgende longe hwīle\r\nwilna
  brūceð ond nō wið-spriceð,\r\nond þonne æfter dēaþe  dēman onginneð,\r\nmeldan mislīce.
  Micel is tō hycganne\r\nwīs-fæstum menn, hwæt sēo wiht sȳ."
transpoem: "Are certain folds of field\r\nonly to be furnished\r\nto their fairness\r\nby
  the most calloused\r\nand by the coarsest\r\nand by the cruelest\r\nemployments
  men may endeavor?\r\n \r\nMay she be ferried so far away\r\nto the doors of majesty—\r\nRiven,
  thriven, ruffled,\r\nshuffled, bluffed, buffed to dry,\r\nbundled, wreathed, sheathed,\r\nwoven,
  cloven, fluttering, shuddering —\r\nall polished up and finished up.\r\n           \r\nRapturous
  ecstasy ever\r\nlies captured inside\r\nfor whatever breathes,\r\nadhering and inhering,\r\nfor
  those enduring longest,\r\nenjoying one’s pleasures —\r\nno need to speak ill of
  it —\r\nand after her death,\r\nshe reckons their account,\r\nchattering a thousand
  ways.\r\n \r\nIt’s a lot to take in\r\nfor the wisdom-thick\r\nwhat creature she
  might be."
note: "<p>Nowhere else in the extant Old English corpus is the need for non-conforming,
  deviant, and Queer translation more urgently felt than in the “Exeter Book Riddles”.
  These voices repeatedly insist that they are “amazing” (<em>wundorlīcu</em>) and
  “fascinating” (<em>wrætlīc</em>), yet it is quite easy to fail to clock their extravagance
  in how they are usually rendered. My translations endeavor to re-estrange these
  poems, breaking down critical complacencies regarding them. I work to vibe with
  their voices — to follow the weird wendings of their language, to stay awake to
  their glitches and hiccups, and most of all to listen to their expressive capacities.
  Nonconforming identities, desires, and experiences are often awkward to state aloud
  and therefore are easily spoken over, and so the riddles often give voice to the
  voiceless, not only to objects or animals but also to those otherwise invisible
  socially.</p>\r\n<p>The question of stranger and kinsfolk is central to “Riddle
  7,” usually solved as “Cuckoo” — a macabre story of nature sometimes used as a warning
  against fostering another’s children (this is a sub-plot of <em>Beowulf</em>, for
  instance). Yet the text of this poem resists that interpretation: the manuscript
  reading <em>snārlīce swā</em> [literally “like a snare”; here perhaps, “deviously”]
  is conventionally emended to <em>swā ārlīce swā</em> [“as graciously as”], which
  casts the step-mother as noble victim of this interloper. My translation opens up
  further possibilities of interpretation by refusing to take sides and suggests other
  motivations for taking in children: hostage-taking; enslavement; even placement
  in a monastery.</p>\r\n<p>Just above “Riddle 15” in the <em>Exeter Book</em>, the
  runic characters “Beorc” and “Lagu” can be found, possibly pointing to a solution
  containing the letters “B” and “L”. It was frequent to assume this poem was solved
  by “ballista” or “fortified town” — those letters, however, may be more convincingly
  read as <em>bēo-loca</em>: a “bees’ horde” or beehive. For this translation I chose
  a style derived from hip-hop verse, four beats per line, with an internal rhyme.
  In doing this, I open the possibility of a new voice in the poem: a poet grappling
  with their own potential for violence. Filled with sweetness, defended by the points
  of spears, this speaker bears a striking resemblance to the narrators created by
  Biggie Smalls or the Geto Boys.</p>\r\n<p>The proximity of a riddle to its solution
  is often found reassuring, but what if there is none apparent? What if there’s no
  need for one? “Riddle 26” is one of just a few poems like this in the collection;
  its dazzle of rhyming, chiming sound-play has eluded scholars since the nineteenth
  century. Previous solutions seek to harness this aural profligacy to the process
  of craft — making beer or a manuscript book. But what if this wallowing in the fun
  actually goes nowhere? What if these pleasures are non-productive, self-contained,
  private — unnecessary to interpret?</p>"
abio: "<p>The “Exeter Book Riddles” are found in an Old English miscellany produced
  between 950–1000 CE, now housed at Exeter Cathedral Library. Few of these riddles,
  if any, were produced by the same hand, and the idea of an “author” may not even
  be particularly relevant to its immediate audiences, making these crafty jewels
  difficult to contextualize in ways that modern scholarship finds reassuring. Unlike
  extant Anglo-Latin riddles, these poems do not include solutions, and many of the
  answers suggested by scholars are highly speculative and much-debated. Most likely
  the <em>Exeter Book</em> was produced in a monastery and many of its contents are
  religious in nature, making these determinedly material and quotidian expressions
  stand out even more. Other than that, it’s tough to tell what purpose they served
  or how they were meant to be used or enjoyed.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Ophelia Eryn Hostetter (they/them) is an Associate Professor at Rutgers
  University-Camden, specializing in Old and Middle English Literature. They are the
  host and translator of the <em>Old English Poetry Project</em>, which contains verse
  translations of about 29,000 lines of OE poetry (out of ~32,000 extant). Their latest
  project, <em>Old English Translation Beyond the Horizon</em>, explores how cultural
  and academic nostalgia in early English studies has throttled innovation and inclusivity
  in early English studies. Dr. Hostetter offers a way past this inertia by mobilizing
  Queer Translation tactics that open new possibilities for discovery in this archive
  by way of digital media studies, New Materialisms and affect theory, Queer, feminist
  and Trans studies, hip-hop poetics, and translation theory, as well as manuscript
  studies and linguistic study.</p>"
