  руины дыхания отстраивают город
  в отладках архитектуры языка длящегося в темпоральности
  наземных, серединных и подземных лесов

  <h1></h1>

  луковицы волос на головах гор

  множество {вершина1, вершина2, вершина3… вершинаN} с полутонами кожи и веснушками зарослей

  горизонт разделяет витрувианское дерево
  /_180° на каждую сторону

  тень дрожания веток растёт по экспоненте отдаления эха

  [отрицательное дерево
  описывает квадрат]

  <p>Our practice involved group collaboration between the five translators and the poet Kateryna Derysheva. We each chose initial translations to draft for the poems and then met to collectively finalize them alongside Kateryna. This process involved having Kateryna read the original poems in Russian and providing invaluable commentary on her word choice and intended images. Translators are listed in alphabetical order to reflect the collective nature of our work.</p>
  <p>Kateryna Derisheva’s current poetic work is a form of research practice, oriented at once towards the poet’s own position in language, and towards the languages that surround her: everyday, technical, professional, etc. One may take, for example, her poem “[lake icing over]” (“[<span lang="ru">замерзающее озеро</span>]). In Kateryna’s account of work on this poem, it began with contemplation of “a metaphor that was chasing me— the image of a lake as the cornea of an eye” as well as the image of “a tree growing out of the pupil.” She proceeded with consultation of specialized writing on biology and of dictionaries. Associations with surveillance cameras and retractable lenses followed. Work continued through a series of additional ruminations on what the lake-cornea sees or does not see—snow, or a peculiar negative, reversed snow. Finally, work on the poem led to an additional set of associations relating to the process of recording an image on a bitmap. The end result is a chain of signification, linked together by grammar and a logic that is less that of a dream and closer to that of a poetic “dictionary of collocation”—an experimental exploration of the linguistically possible at the intersection of polyvocal linguistic practices.</p>
