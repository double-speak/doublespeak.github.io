poem: "руины дыхания отстраивают город\r\nв отладках архитектуры языка длящегося в
  темпоральности\r\nназемных, серединных и подземных лесов\r\n\r\n2023\r\n\r\n<h1></h1>\r\n\r\nлуковицы

  полутонами кожи и веснушками зарослей\r\n\r\nгоризонт разделяет витрувианское дерево\r\n/_180°
  на каждую сторону\r\n\r\nтень дрожания веток растёт по экспоненте отдаления эха\r\n\r\n[отрицательное

  реки\r\n\r\nпотоки воды считывают файлы камней\r\n\r\nмерцающие курсоры деревьев
  воспроизводят движение природы\r\n\r\nинтерфейс ручья существует в момент обращения
  к данным\r\n\r\n{в файлах камней – отпечатки появления света}\r\n\r\nданные отображаются

  extended in temporality\r\nfrom surface, median, and subterranean wood\r\n\r\n2023\r\n\r\n<h1></h1>\r\n\r\nfollicles

note: "<p>Our practice involved group collaboration between the five translators and
  the poet Kateryna Derysheva. We each chose initial translations to draft for the
  poems and then met to collectively finalize them alongside Kateryna. This process
  involved having Kateryna read the original poems in Russian and providing invaluable
  commentary on her word choice and intended images. Translators are listed in alphabetical
  order to reflect the collective nature of our work.</p>\r\n<p>Kateryna Derisheva’s
  current poetic work is a form of research practice, oriented at once towards the
  poet’s own position in language, and towards the languages that surround her: everyday,
  technical, professional, etc. One may take, for example, her poem “[lake icing over]”
  (“[<span lang=\"ru\">замерзающее озеро</span>]). In Kateryna’s account of work on
  this poem, it began with contemplation of “a metaphor that was chasing me— the image
  of a lake as the cornea of an eye” as well as the image of “a tree growing out of
  the pupil.” She proceeded with consultation of specialized writing on biology and
  of dictionaries. Associations with surveillance cameras and retractable lenses followed.
  Work continued through a series of additional ruminations on what the lake-cornea
  sees or does not see—snow, or a peculiar negative, reversed snow. Finally, work
  on the poem led to an additional set of associations relating to the process of
  recording an image on a bitmap. The end result is a chain of signification, linked
  together by grammar and a logic that is less that of a dream and closer to that
  of a poetic “dictionary of collocation”—an experimental exploration of the linguistically
  possible at the intersection of polyvocal linguistic practices.</p>"
