poem: "e como eu palmilhasse vagamente\r\numa estrada de Minas, pedregosa,\r\ne no
  fecho da tarde um sino rouco\r\n\r\nse misturasse ao som de meus sapatos\r\nque
  era pausado e seco; e aves pairassem\r\nno céu de chumbo, e suas formas pretas\r\n\r\nlentamente
  se fossem diluindo\r\nna escuridão maior, vinda dos montes\r\ne de meu próprio ser
  desenganado,\r\n\r\na máquina do mundo se entreabriu\r\npara quem de a romper já
  se esquivava\r\ne só de o ter pensado se carpia.\r\n\r\nAbriu-se majestosa e circunspecta,\r\nsem
  emitir um som que fosse impuro\r\nnem um clarão maior que o tolerável\r\n\r\npelas
  pupilas gastas na inspeção\r\ncontínua e dolorosa do deserto,\r\ne pela mente exausta
  de mentar\r\n\r\ntoda uma realidade que transcende\r\na própria imagem sua debuxada\r\nno
  rosto do mistério, nos abismos.\r\n\r\nAbriu-se em calma pura, e convidando\r\nquantos
  sentidos e intuições restavam\r\na quem de os ter usado os já perdera\r\n\r\ne nem
  desejaria recobrá-los,\r\nse em vão e para sempre repetimos\r\nos mesmos sem roteiro
  tristes périplos,\r\n\r\nconvidando-os a todos, em coorte,\r\na se aplicarem sobre
  o pasto inédito\r\nda natureza mítica das coisas,\r\n\r\nassim me disse, embora
  voz alguma\r\nou sopro ou eco ou simples percussão\r\natestasse que alguém, sobre
  a montanha,\r\n\r\na outro alguém, noturno e miserável,\r\nem colóquio se estava
  dirigindo:\r\n“O que procuraste em ti ou fora de\r\n\r\nteu ser restrito e nunca
  se mostrou,\r\nmesmo afetando dar-se ou se rendendo,\r\ne a cada instante mais se
  retraindo,\r\n\r\nolha, repara, ausculta: essa riqueza\r\nsobrante a toda pérola,
  essa ciência\r\nsublime e formidável, mas hermética,\r\n\r\nessa total explicação
  da vida,\r\nesse nexo primeiro e singular,\r\nque nem concebes mais, pois tão esquivo\r\n\r\nse
  revelou ante a pesquisa ardente\r\nem que te consumiste… vê, contempla,\r\nabre
  teu peito para agasalhá-lo.”\r\n\r\nAs mais soberbas pontes e edifícios,\r\no que
  nas oficinas se elabora,\r\no que pensado foi e logo atinge\r\n\r\ndistância superior
  ao pensamento,\r\nos recursos da terra dominados\r\ne as paixões e os impulsos e
  os tormentos\r\n\r\ne tudo o que define o ser terrestre\r\nou se prolonga até nos
  animais\r\ne chega às plantas para se embeber\r\n\r\nno sono rancoroso dos minérios,\r\ndá
  volta ao mundo e torna a se engolfar\r\nna estranha ordem geométrica de tudo,\r\n\r\ne
  o absurdo original e seus enigmas,\r\nsuas verdades altas mais que tantos\r\nmonumentos
  erguidos à verdade;\r\n\r\né a memória dos deuses, e o solene\r\nsentimento da morte,
  que floresce\r\nno caule da existência mais gloriosa,\r\n\r\ntudo se apresentou
  nesse relance\r\ne me chamou para seu reino augusto,\r\nafinal submetido à vista
  humana.\r\n\r\nMas, como eu relutasse em responder\r\na tal apelo assim maravilhoso,\r\npois
  a fé se abrandara, e mesmo o anseio,\r\n\r\na esperança mais mínima — esse anelo\r\nde
  ver desvanecida a treva espessa\r\nque entre os raios do sol inda se filtra;\r\n\r\ncomo
  defuntas crenças convocadas\r\npresto e fremente não se produzissem\r\na de novo
  tingir a neutra face\r\n\r\nque vou pelos caminhos demonstrando,\r\ne como se outro
  ser, não mais aquele\r\nhabitante de mim há tantos anos,\r\n\r\npassasse a comandar
  minha vontade\r\nque, já de si volúvel, se cerrava\r\nsemelhante a essas flores
  reticentes\r\n\r\nem si mesmas abertas e fechadas;\r\ncomo se um dom tardio já não
  fora\r\napetecível, antes despiciendo,\r\n\r\nbaixei os olhos, incurioso, lasso,\r\ndesdenhando
  colher a coisa oferta\r\nque se abria gratuita a meu engenho.\r\n\r\nA treva mais
  estrita já pousara\r\nsobre a estrada de Minas, pedregosa,\r\ne a máquina do mundo,
  repelida,\r\n\r\nse foi miudamente recompondo,\r\nenquanto eu, avaliando o que perdera,\r\nseguia
  vagaroso, de mãos pensas."
transpoem: "And as I came wandering, ponderously,\r\ndown some rough old Minas road,
  rocky, potholed, \r\nand at evening-fall the rusted peal of a bell\r\n\r\nmixed
  its bronze moan with my crunching footsteps,\r\npaced and crisp on the stones; and
  in the leaden sky\r\nbirds were hovering, their charcoal, corvid forms\r\n\r\nslowly
  dissolving, as if swallowed back\r\ninto the greater darkness coming off the mountains\r\nand
  from my ownmost, disabused self,  \r\n\r\nthe machine of the world unveiled itself
  \r\nto me, who would sooner have recoiled on sight,\r\njust turned and ran at the
  very prospect of it.\r\n\r\nIt gaped before me, majestic and circumspect,\r\nand
  none but the purest of sounds met my ears\r\nand a brilliant light unburdened my
  glare-worn eyes, \r\n\r\nsoothing pupils baked by constant, painful\r\ninspection
  of searing wastes and deserts,\r\nand mind exhausted by contemplations\r\n\r\nof
  a reality beyond the reflections\r\nwatching from the pool over which it leans,\r\nlost
  in the face of mystery, in the abyss.\r\n\r\nIt opened to me calm and pure, inviting\r\nwhat
  meanings and intuitions there remained\r\nto one who had used up a life’s-worth
  already\r\n\r\nand had no inclination to recover them\r\nif only to retread, forever
  and in vain,\r\nthe same sad unscripted peregrinations,\r\n\r\nbut here it beckoned
  to them, one by one in train,\r\nto ruminate upon this virgin pasture\r\nof the
  mythical nature of all things.\r\n\r\nOr so I was told, though no voice was heard,\r\nor
  wind rush, or echo, or simple percussion\r\nto testify that one, up on the mountainside,\r\n\r\naddressed,
  in colloquy, this listening other \r\n—nocturnal, miserable—, with these uttered
  words:\r\n“That which you seek within yourself, or beyond\r\n\r\nyour own restricted
  being, and has never\r\nrevealed itself, or feigned revealing, but coyly\r\nwithdraws
  further and further from perception,\r\n\r\nMark it now, watch and listen: this
  abundance\r\nvastly richer than any pearl, this science,\r\nsublime and formidable,
  yet hermetic,\r\n\r\nthis total explanation of all life,\r\nthis nexus, primordial
  and singular,\r\nso elusive it forever slipped your grasp,\r\n\r\nimpenetrable to
  the ardent inquiries\r\nthat long consumed your mind…see, contemplate,\r\nopen your
  bosom and let it come in.”\r\n\r\nThe most superb of bridges and high-rise towers,\r\nall
  that the workshops of men conspire to design,\r\nand once so drawn take form and
  far outstrip\r\n\r\nin distance even the widest striding thoughts,\r\nthe resources
  of the earth harnessed to our will,\r\nand the passions, and the impulses, the endless
  torments,\r\n\r\neverything that defines terrestrial being,\r\ncreaturely being,
  down to the animals, \r\nto all organic life, and beyond that still,\r\n\r\nto the
  rancorous slumber of minerals and ores,\r\nit swirls around the globe and is swallowed
  back\r\ninto the strange geometry of the whole,\r\n\r\nand the primal absurdity,
  its mysteries,\r\nand towering truths, taller than so many \r\nmonuments erected
  in the name of truth;\r\n\r\nand to the memory of the gods, and the solemn\r\nsentiment
  of death, which flowers on the stem\r\nof even the most glorious existence,\r\n\r\nit
  all presented itself in that same flash\r\nbeckoning me to its august kingdom,\r\nfinally
  bared for human eyes to see.\r\n\r\nBut as I hesitated, balking before\r\nthat miraculous
  and startling appeal,\r\nfor my faith had waned, and even my desire,\r\n\r\nthe
  most minimal of hopes—the yearning\r\nto see dispelled those folds of blackened
  cloud\r\nthat still encroached upon the sun's bright rays;\r\n\r\nbut as moribund
  beliefs scrambled to the front,\r\nsummoned from retirement, could not muster\r\nsufficient
  verve to reanimate that neutral face\r\n\r\nwhich I along these roads have shown
  the world, \r\nas if some other man, no more the tenant\r\nwho had occupied this
  body decades long, \r\n\r\nhad seized the reins and stirrups of my will,\r\nwhich,
  fickle as was its wont, curled itself shut,\r\nafter those shy, ungenerous flowers\r\n\r\nthat
  are, in themselves, both open and closed;\r\nbut just as \"late\" is often worse
  than \"never,\"\r\nand the belated gift is greeted with disdain,\r\n\r\nI lowered
  my gaze, listless, uncurious, \r\ndeclining to claim what was freely given,\r\nthere
  for me to do with as I pleased. \r\n \r\nThe most peerless darkness fast descended\r\nupon
  that rough old Minas road, rocky, potholed,\r\nand the machine of the world, its
  invite rebuffed,\r\n\r\nrecomposed in a shrinking whorl and then withdrew,\r\nas
  I, trying to measure what I’d spurned,\r\ncontinued on my way, hands wrung empty.\r\n"
note: "<p>“A Máquina do Mundo” is widely considered the best Brazilian poem ever written,
  but I have yet to find an English translation that captures both its style and content
  with equal fidelity. Some take far too many liberties (one even imposes a non-existent
  rhyme scheme), while others are excessively literal in their approach. None, to
  my ear at least, really sounds like Drummond. So I wanted to produce a translation
  that was true to his original in content and style.</p>\r\n<p>The key to the pace
  and flow of this ninety-six-line poem is the fact that it is only six sentences
  long in Portuguese. While it wasn’t possible to match that exactly, I was able to
  keep it to only seven sentences.</p>\r\n<p>The poem was largely written in dodecasyllabic
  lines, with slight variations (many lines drop to eleven syllables or overshoot
  to thirteen). The basic pattern was three to four long stresses per line. To capture
  that stress pattern in English, I oscillated between decasyllable and dodecasyllable
  lines, to compensate for the reductions of unstressed syllables in Portuguese. 
  As English words tend to be shorter than Portuguese, I sometimes found that lines
  needed some padding so as not to break the pattern. However, this was always done
  without departing from Drummond’s basic intentions. For example, the line “passasse
  a comandar a minha vontade…” (thirteen syllables) would usually translate as “had
  begun to command my will…” (eight syllables), so I fleshed this out with a horse-riding
  image that spoke to the verb “command”—‘had seized the reins and stirrups of my
  will” (10 syllables). This allowed me to keep pattern with the preceding and following
  lines without altering the sense in any way.</p>\r\n<p>There is no rhyme in the
  poem, but there is frequent assonance, and I tried to mirror that where possible.
  Portuguese words are heavy in gender-specific “a” and “o” noun, adjective and participle
  endings, and a lot of the assonance is based on these (“uma estrada de Minas, pedregosa”).
  As English word endings are far more varied than in Portuguese, I often had to opt
  for alliteration and other forms of consonance (“rough old Minas road, rocky, potholed”)
  instead.</p>"
abio: "<p>Carlos Drummond de Andrade was born in the mining town of Itabira, Minas
  Gerais, in 1902. He studied pharmacy, worked for a time as a journalist, and finally
  settled into a career in the civil service.  He is considered one of Brazil’s most
  important poets, and left an extensive oeuvre behind him upon his death in Rio de
  Janeiro, in 1987. Though he was part of the generation of modernists that transformed
  Brazilian literature and art, he was only ever modernist on his own terms, and he
  would be bound to no manifesto. Early on, he was mentored by both Oswald de Andrade
  and Mario de Andrade, but his own firmly held beliefs about poetry and the directions
  he wanted to take it put constant strains on these relationships. Original, mischievous,
  and critical, Drummond’s poetry probed Brazil’s sociopolitical reality and the often
  stark contrast between industrialized, urban modernity and the simplicity of the
  rural heartlands. There’s also a strong existentialist quality to his work, with
  his exploration of the themes of mortality, memory, regret and his own awkwardness
  in the world. As Mauro Villar points out, some critics see “three Drummonds”: the
  early humorous poet, the mid-career “social poet,” and, finally, the “semiclassical
  pessimist.” “A Máquina do Mundo” is perhaps best described in terms of the latter.
  It belongs to the volume <em>Claro Enigma</em>, published in 1951. </p>"
