title: Au maître d'un jardin
transtitle: To the master of a garden
author: Antoine-Vincent Arnault
translator: Gabrielle Wang
poem: "De ce chaume heureux possesseur, \r\nDe bon cœur, hélas ! que j'envie \r\nTes
  travaux, ta philosophie, \r\nTa solitude et ton bonheur ! \r\n\r\nPour prix des
  soins que tu leur donnes,\r\nTes arbustes reconnaissants\r\nEt des printemps et
  des automnes\r\nTe prodiguent les doux présents.\r\n\r\nÔ trop heureux qui peut
  connaître\r\nLa jouissance de cueillir\r\nLe fruit que ses soins font mûrir,\r\nLa
  fleur que ses soins ont fait naître !\r\n\r\nToujours la terre envers nos bras \r\nS'est
  acquittée avec usure. \r\nQui veut s'éloigner des ingrats \r\nSe rapproche de la
  nature. \r\n\r\nNe craindre et ne désirer rien, \r\nEtre aimé de l'objet qu'on aime,
  \r\nC'est bien là le bonheur suprême;\r\nC'est le sort des dieux, c'est le tien. "
transpoem: "Of this grass content possessor,\r\nOf  good heart, alas! How I fancy\r\nYour
  labor, your philosophy,\r\nYour solitude and your comfort!\r\n\r\nFor cost of care
  you give to them,\r\nYour shrubbery appreciative\r\nAnd with some springs and some
  autumns\r\nLavish you the pleasant donatives.\r\n\r\nO too content who comprehends\r\nThe
  joy which harvest can breed\r\nThe fruit which his care has ripened,\r\nThe flower
  which his care conceived !\r\n\r\nAlways the earth beneath our arms\r\nWhich has
  with our use unfettered.\r\nThose who wish to avoid ingrates\r\nBecome ever close
  with nature.\r\n\r\nApprehend and desire not,\r\nBeing loved by that which we love,\r\nIs
  utter happiness–above;\r\nIs the sort of gods, what you’ve got."
note: "<p>Translating this poem was a delicate process. I often faced frustrations
  about how to best interpret and reflect decisions made by the author that were only
  grammatically correct in the French way–the way the words were intended. Quite literally
  mirroring meanings was necessary, for the subject-description order of words in
  French could be considered the direct opposite of English grammar. As a result,
  this mirroring often resulted in a loss of context and, consequently, accuracy of
  comprehension. A sense of suspense that could only be established in the original
  placement of phrases was also impossible to mimic with English while maintaining
  the laws of grammar. Thus, I intermittently broke various rules in my best efforts
  to preserve meaning, which may have resulted in a cacophony of mismatched grammar
  interpretations. I sincerely hope that my efforts to preserve meaning did not disturb
  the peaceful constancy in the parallel structures artfully posed by Antoine-Vincent
  Arnault at his time of writing. Reversing these phrases felt like upending all of
  Arnault’s careful deliberation, for poetry is inherently an art of precision and
  intention. As a migrated teenage admirer of French poetry, I often doubted that
  it was my place to take this beloved artist’s work into my young hands. Unqualified
  and equipped with the level of grammar enabled by a lifetime of geographical isolation,
  I frequently cringed at my elementary attempts to match the beauty of the original
  words. Furthermore, prioritizing meaning and intention meant rewriting the poem
  through the eyes of the original poet, thus sacrificing my own preferences in the
  process. In the end, this poem, line by line, is a series of one-sided compromises
  between the poet and myself, the translator.</p>\r\n"
abio: "<p>Born in Paris in 1766, Antoine-Vincent Arnault was a French poet and fabulist
  who specialized in Republican tragedies. He established his reputation with his
  first work: Marius d Minturnes, a tragedy play first performed on May 19, 1791 on
  le Theatre Francais in Paris.</p>\r\n<p>As a sympathizer of the political group
  opposing the government during the Reign of Terror, Antoine-Vincent Arnault was
  forced to flee France until the political environment became less hostile. Regardless,
  he was arrested upon his return due to this allegiance. A lack of historical records
  makes it unclear how he evaded prison, but it is believed that fellow dramatists
  and changes in political climate likely assisted his liberation.</p>\r\n<p>Arnault
  re-established his reputation after commission from Napoleon Bonaparte and nomination
  as secretary general of L’Institut Francais. He was a member of the Légion D'Honneur:
  the highest order of merit established by Napoleon in 1802 to restore honor after
  the Revolution. As a poet and playwright, Arnault capsulated difficult periods of
  the French Revolution with works that reflected French ideals of fraternity and
  liberty.</p>\r\n<p>Although his arrest demonstrates ambiguity of his reception in
  France, Arnault made significant contributions to nationalism, greatly impacting
  the political landscape during his lifetime.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Gabrielle Wang os currently a junior in high school. As a daughter of Chinese
  and Canadian immigrants and a member of a French-speaking household, poetry and
  literature has consistently been her method of embracing and connecting her heritage
  to her new American culture. Growing up in a relatively small town, the library
  was her favorite weekly adventure. After moving multiple times, reading has unfailingly
  remained along with passions for science, cooking, hiking, and meeting new people!</p>"
