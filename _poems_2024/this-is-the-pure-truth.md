transtitle: This Is the Pure Truth
author: Robert Bolaño
translator: Naomi Bernstein
poem: "Me he criado al lado de puritanos revolucionarios\r\nHe sido criticado ayudado
  empujado por héroes\r\nde la poesía lírica\r\ny del balancín de la muerte.\r\nQuiero
  decir que mi lirismo es DIFERENTE\r\n(ya está todo expresado pero permitidme\r\nañadir
  algo más). \r\nNadar en los pantanos de la cursilería\r\nes para mí como un Acapulco
  de sangre de pescado\r\nuna Disneylandia submarina\r\nEn donde soy en paz conmigo.
  \r\n\r\nRaro oficio gratuito          Ir perdiendo el pelo\r\ny los dientes           Las
  antiguas maneras de ser educado\r\nExtraña complacencia           (El poeta no desea
  ser más\r\nque los otros)           Ni riqueza ni fama ni tan sólo\r\npoesía           Tai
  vez ésta sea la única forma\r\nde no tener miedo           Instalarse en el miedo\r\ncomo
  quien vive dentro de la lentitud\r\nFantasmas que todos poseemos           Simplemente\r\naguardando
  a alguien o algo sobre las ruinas"
transpoem: "I was raised alongside revolutionary puritans \r\nI have been criticized
  saved and shoved by heroes \r\nof lyric poetry \r\nand the rocking chair of death.
  \r\nI want to say that my lyricism is DIFFERENT \r\n(everything has been expressed
  already but permit me \r\nto add one more thing). \r\nTo swim in the swamps of vulgarity
  \r\nis for me like an Acapulco of mercury \r\nan Acapulco of fish blood \r\nan underwater
  Disneyland \r\nwhere I am at peace with myself. \r\nStrange gratuitous trade           To
  go losing one’s hair\r\nand one’s teeth           The old ways of becoming educated
  \r\nStrange complacency           (The poet does not desire to be more \r\nthan
  others)           Neither in riches nor fame nor in poetry \r\nitself           Maybe
  this is the only form \r\nof not being afraid           To install oneself in the
  fear \r\nlike those who live within slowness \r\nGhosts that we all possess           Simply
  \r\nwaiting for someone or something among the ruins\r\n"
note: "<p>Aside from a few ambiguous words, the most difficult part about translating
  this poem was deciding whether it was one poem, or two. In his <em>Poesía Reunida</em>,
  the two sections sit on two consecutive pages, mirroring each other, and the second
  part has no title. The two parts have different spacing and punctuation patterns.
  They may very well be separate, but to me they seem inextricable, almost dialectical.
  I see them as a call and response — between the poet’s egoic inflation (a result
  perhaps of what Bolaño called “the shadow of ecstasy,” which according to him, even
  the worst and most “false” writers have glimpsed) and the “existential mediocrity”
  of his daily life.</p>"
abio: "<p>Roberto Bolaño was a virtuosic writer who rose to prominence in the English
  speaking world only after his death in 2003. Through postmodern structures and flourishes,
  he often takes anonymous, aspiring writers as his subjects, elevating their quotidian
  struggles to the level of an epic. He was known to admire the life of the poet,
  “so excessive, so risky,” he once said. He described poetry as the gesture of an
  adolescent who bets what little he has on a mysterious and little known form, and
  “who generally loses the bet.”</p>"
tbio: "<p>Naomi Bernstein is a rootless cosmopolitan currently living and writing
  in New York.</p>"
