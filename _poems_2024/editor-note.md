note: "<p class=\"ednote\">Dear readers,</p><p class=\"ednote\">\r\nThis year’s issue
  of <em>DoubleSpeak</em> moves from displacement and longing to rootedness and renewal
  — all through the unifying prism of translation. Many poems in this issue are not
  so much fixed texts as they are questions: open, echoing, sometimes unanswerable.</p>\r\n
  \   <p class=\"ednote\">I continue to think of a passage from Mariana Martinez’s
  translation of the Argentine poet Alejandra Pizarnik’s “El despertar,” or as Martinez
  titles it, “The Awakening.” Pizarnik, the biographical note tells us, “was born
  … to the tumultuous life of an exiled Jewish family during World War II,” and her
  sense of history’s tendrils is more visceral than most. Martinez translates Pizarnik’s
  poem here in bold, intuitive ways (“ripen” for “volver,” for example, and “lord”
  for “señor”), but it’s the refrain that, midway through, breaks the narrative open
  with a particularly, continually resonant question:</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ednote\">\"What
  shall I do with this fear?</p>\r\n<p class=\"ednote\">What shall I do with this
  fear?\"</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ednote\">This issue of <em>DoubleSpeak</em> offers
  a wealth and a refusal of answers—maybe most pressingly in Michael Karam’s translation
  of the Palestinian poet Khaled Juma’s “A Little of What Gaza Will Say in a Little.”
  Juma, who is the Director of the Cultural Department for the Palestine News and
  Information Agency, wrote this prose poem in 2011, but as Karam reflects in his
  translator’s note, the poem “feels as if it were written yesterday, or tomorrow,
  or the day after.” </p>\r\n    <p class=\"ednote\">Time blurs; the present becomes
  an unnerving echo of the past and a premonition of what’s to come. “This is my blood,”
  writes Juma: “it begins where the anthem goes quiet.” Here, fear is not declared
  but submerged, living in the silence between lines.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ednote\">Throughout
  this issue of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>, translation is not only a method of transmission
  but a kind of shared root system, hiding beneath the surface and allowing meaning
  to travel between languages. In “Living in Translation,” a musing on the way Chinese
  and English have both shaped and resisted her identity, Jenny Fu highlights this
  metaphor of tree roots in her citation of contemporary poet Shu Ting’s iconic poem
  “To the Oak”:</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ednote\">\"Our roots\r\nhold tightly beneath
  the ground;\r\nour leaves brush and blend in the clouds.\"</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ednote\">Fu’s
  musing acknowledges the side of this ecosystem which is permeated by uncertainty.
  She writes: “I live in these jagged convergences, breaking, and reforming as the
  trees encounter and grow. I sing the notes, confused and babbling, jigsaws that
  don't fit together but complement each other to create a whole. <em>Do you think
  you are Canadian or Chinese?</em> I can't respond because the notes of the leaves
  that brush and blend have no name.” This inability to respond is not a failure of
  what poems, speech, and language are capable of, but rather an acknowledgement of
  their rootedness in physicality — especially when meaning is shaped by more than
  one language.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ednote\">Likewise, the pressure of choosing
  how to speak, or who to be, within language, becomes a fruitful refusal. Fu’s question
  of whether to write as a “Chinese” or “Canadian” writer is left unresolved: not
  avoided, but proven to be porous. \r\nThe poems translated here mean to resist singular
  identity; they lean instead into a fluid, unbordered self, ​​one in which fear and
  doubts don’t vanish, but find a shape through which to speak.</p>\r\n    <p class=\"ednote\">This
  issue of <em>DoubleSpeak</em> does not seek to pin down the identities of its poems,
  or to reduce their questions to one-dimensional answers. (What shall I do with this
  fear?) Rather, it dwells in the poems — allowing language to carry their weight
  across borders and time.</p>                                                                                               <p
  <p class=\"ednote\">With this, I welcome you to our Spring 2024 issue, and I invite
  you to explore the many routes, turns, and questions that inhabit it.</p>\r\n<p>Sincerely,<br>Daria
  Knurenko<br>Staff Editor</p>\r\n    <p> . </p>\r\n    <p> . </p>"
