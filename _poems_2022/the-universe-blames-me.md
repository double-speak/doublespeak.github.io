title: تلومني الدنيا
transtitle: The universe blames me
author: Nizar Qabbani
translator: Michael Karam
poem: |-
  تلومني الدنيا إذا أحببته
  كأنني.. أنا خلقت الحب واخترعته
  كأنني أنا على خدود الورد قد رسمته
  كأنني أنا التي..
  للطير في السماء قد علمته
  وفي حقول القمح قد زرعته
  وفي مياه البحر قد ذوبته..
  كأنني.. أنا التي
  كالقمر الجميل في السماء..
  قد علقته..
  تلومني الدنيا إذا..
  سميت من أحب.. أو ذكرته..
  كأنني أنا الهوى..
  وأمه.. وأخته..
  هذا الهوى الذي أتى..
  من حيث ما انتظرته
  مختلفٌ عن كل ما عرفته
  مختلفٌ عن كل ما قرأته
  وكل ما سمعته
  لو كنت أدري أنه..
  نوعٌ من الإدمان.. ما أدمنته
  لو كنت أدري أنه..
  بابٌ كثير الريح.. ما فتحته
  لو كنت أدري أنه..
  عودٌ من الكبريت.. ما أشعلته
  هذا الهوى.. أعنف حبٍ عشته
  فليتني حين أتاني فاتحاً
  يديه لي.. رددته
  وليتني من قبل أن يقتلني.. قتلته..
  هذا الهوى الذي أراه في الليل..
  على ستائري..
  أراه.. في ثوبي..
  وفي عطري.. وفي أساوري
  أراه.. مرسوماً على وجه يدي..
  أراه منقوشاً على مشاعري
  لو أخبروني أنه
  طفلٌ كثير اللهو والضوضاء ما أدخلته
  وأنه سيكسر الزجاج في قلبي لما تركته
  لو أخبروني أنه..
  سيضرم النيران في دقائقٍ
  ويقلب الأشياء في دقائقٍ
  ويصبغ الجدران بالأحمر والأزرق في دقائقٍ
  لكنت قد طردته..
  يا أيها الغالي الذي..
  أرضيت عني الله.. إذ أحببته
  هذا الهوى أجمل حبٍ عشته
  أروع حبٍ عشته
  فليتني حين أتاني زائراً
  بالورد قد طوقته..
  وليتني حين أتاني باكياً
  فتحت أبوابي له.. وبسته
transpoem: "the universe blames me if I love him \nas if I created love and invented
  it \nas if I had drawn it on the cheeks of roses \nas if I were the one who \nhad
  taught it to the birds in the sky \nand planted it in wheat fields \nand stirred
  it in seawater \nas if I am the one who\nhad hung it \nlike the moon in the sky
  \nthe universe blames me if \nI name who I love or mention him \nas if I were passion
  \nand its mother and its sister \nthis passion that arrived \nfrom where I hadn’t
  been expecting \ndifferent than all I had known \ndifferent than all I had read
  \nand all I had heard \nhad I known that it was a \ntype of addiction I wouldn’t
  have taken it \nhad I known that it was \na windy door I wouldn’t have opened it
  \nhad I known that it was \na matchstick I wouldn’t have lit it \nthis passion is
  the most violent love I’ve lived \nI wish when he came to me\narms wide open I had
  turned him away \nI wish that before he killed me I had killed him \nthis passion
  I see in the dark \non my curtains\nI see it in my dress \nand in my perfume and
  in my bracelets \nI see it drawn on the faces of my palms\nI see it carved on my
  feelings \nhad they told me that he was\na loud and playful child I wouldn’t have
  let him in \nhad they told me he would break my glass heart I wouldn’t have let
  him \nhad they told me \nhe’d set a fire in minutes \nand he’d make a mess in minutes
  \nand he’d dye the walls red and blue in minutes\nI would have expelled him \ndearest
  precious who \ngot god to pardon me if I loved him \nthis passion is the most beautiful
  love I’ve lived\nthe greatest love I’ve lived \nI wish when he came to me visiting\nI
  had surrounded him with roses \nAnd I wish when he came to me crying\nI had opened
  my doors and kissed him "

  <p>I chose to translate a Qabbani poem because of how much his name and works remind me of my early schooling in Lebanon. While he is not as famous in America, I hope this is a step toward a growing fascinated audience. Because Arabic is a gendered language, it is clear that the speaker is a woman, a fact which gets lost in English. Because the word “passion” (<span lang="ar">الهوى</span>) and the speaker’s lover both use the same set of masculine pronouns, a reader of the original cannot properly identify to whom or to what the speaker is referring. In English, these two nouns use different pronouns (“it” and “he,” respectively), requiring the translator to decide when “passion” was the antecedent and when it was the lover. The original, like most modern poems in Arabic, uses ellipses heavily, which I don’t enjoy as much in an English poem; I opted for longer spaces instead.

  <p>Nizar Qabbani (1923–1998) is a timeless Arab poet known for his sensual and romantic verse. A lawyer by training, he spent more than twenty years working as a diplomat. In addition to his two dozen volumes of poetry and his contributions to the Lebanese newspaper <em>Al Hayat</em>, his poetry has been sung in lyrics by Lebanese and Syrian vocalists, popularizing his work. People, young and old, in Lebanon — he lived in Beirut for a while — and Syria, his home country, sing along to these familiar tunes. Qabbani writes of romantic and political despair and advocates for Arab nationalism and social freedoms for women.
