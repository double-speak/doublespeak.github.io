title: Manteniéndome firme
transtitle: Unwavering
author: Zoraida Armengol
translator: Pablo Abrante
poem: |-
  Para que no se enojen
  las musas de las avenidas,
  escribo en mis tiempos libres;
  para mantenerme viva.

  Para que no se aleje
  el salitre con alas vistiendo,
  escribo sobre el hermoso encanto;
  para seguir existiendo.

  Para que no se arrepientan
  las luces tenues encendidas,
  escribo cuando nadie sabe;
  para continuar de pie, erguida.

  Para que no se espanten
  el ir y venir del quehacer,
  escribo con más ganas de antes;
  para vivir un poco más que ayer.

  Para que ambas a mí acudan,
  las lágrimas y la maravilla,
  escribo en fracciones de segundos;
  para saberme realmente viva.
transpoem: |-
  So as not to anger the avenue
  muses, I write
  in my free time;
  so to keep myself alive.

  So the saltpeter wearing wings
  doesn’t fly away drifting,
  I write of beautiful delight;
  so to keep existing.

  So the dim lights don’t
  regret turning on at all,
  I write when no one knows;
  so to keep afoot, standing tall.

  So as not to scare off the
  come and go of work and play,
  I write more earnestly than before;
  so to live a bit more than yesterday.

  So tears and wonder
  both might arrive,
  I write in fractions of seconds;
  so to know myself truly alive.

  <p>i adore formal poetry.</p>
  <p>this poem was tough to translate without sacrificing the rhyme — i’m very thankful for my friend Olive’s help here! i like to say that, when translating, <em>something has to go</em>, be it tone, literalness, or rhyme. i think that translation means composing a poem like a native speaker of another language, but if you keep the form, you usually sacrifice literal meaning.</p>
  <p>take <em>alas vistiendo</em>: a native speaker might compose that flourish as “dressed in wings,” but then how do we rhyme that with “existing”?
  <em>arrepientan</em> doesn’t have an object in the Spanish… <i>what exactly would the dim lights regret?</i></p>
  <p><em>de pie, erguida</em> means “on my feet, standing straight,” but that’s so many words and the tone is all formal. the expression is physical, but the poet clearly uses it symbolically as well.</p>
  <p>i took advantage of those ambiguous moments and a little enjambment to preserve the rhyme. the rhythm is light in spanish, whereas my translation stretches and crunches back and forth. something had to go, i think.</p>
  <p>the repetition of <em>para</em> was another obstacle, since most literally that’s “for” or at least “in order to.” even my choice to go with “so” is more formal than the relatively neutral register <em>para</em>, but it keeps the motif without taking up too much space. i knew i wanted to translate this poem as soon as i read it. the more i sat with this piece, the more it grew on me. hopefully it’s a reminder to keep <em>me</em> writing; i, too, am keeping alive.</p>
  <p>but who are these <em>avenue muses</em>?</p>

tbio: "<p>howdy, i am Pablo (he/him)! i am Spanish and Cuban and Miamian! i do science,
  translation, and tabletop things. i really enjoy translating poems about striking
  out on one’s own. an urban fantasy novel — about tropical diaspora best friend assassins,
  spilling cafecito for the cafecito god, and queer spanglish passenger seat conversations
  — may or may not be forthcoming.</p>"
