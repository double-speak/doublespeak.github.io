poem: |-
  我无数次地看见过麻雀
  有时在枝丫间
  跳跃。有时掠过我的眼睛
  但这一回
  它躺在我的手心里
  不挣扎，甚至不颤抖
  小小的翅膀，淌着
  血。它不懂
  架网捕鸟的人
  多喜欢它们
  它怎么会懂
  人间的杀戮，占有
  和出卖 ，是喜欢的
  另一种表现方式
  就像他们
  喜欢树木，砍光
  喜欢花朵，掐掉
  喜欢天空，就剪去翅膀
  喜欢人民，就让他们
  一辈子，光荣地奋斗
transpoem: "countless times, I have encountered a finch\nsometimes between the branches\nhopping.
  sometimes flashing past my vision\nbut on this particular day\nit lies still in
  my palms\nnot struggling, not even trembling\nonly tiny wings, a trickle of \nblood.
  it does not understand\nhow much the humans setting up the bird nets\nadore them\nhow
  can it comprehend that\nin the human world, bloodshed, possession\nand betrayal,
  are a whole different way\nto express one’s love \nit’s just like them:\nlove the
  trees, fell them all\nlove the blooms, rip the buds\nlove the sky, so cut the wings\nlove
  the people, so let them\nspend their whole lives struggling like heroes"

  This is my second time translating Zhang; (the first translation, “Grave News at Dawn, Great Tidings at Dusk,” can be found in the Spring 2020 <em>Doublespeak</em> issue). Over the past two years, I have accumulated more experience translating contemporary Chinese prose. As a result, I now find myself a little more comfortable with translating Zhang’s prose-like, conversational verse. The biggest challenges in this translation process concern flow and the clarification of conceptual ideas. The final line of the original poem evokes terms often used in Chinese communist propaganda — <span lang= "zh">光荣</span>, to evoke honor and glory, and <span lang= "zh">奋斗</span>, to evoke ceaseless hard work in pursuit of a brighter future. The poet, in referencing this sentiment, is being deliberately sardonic: just like the trees and flowers are ostensibly being destroyed out of love, the people are being guided towards grueling cog-in-the-machine lives that have no regard for their free will or well-being. There are few words with similar connotations in English — “honor,” “glory,” “hard work,” and “gallantry” are all more positive words in English. I chose the word “struggle” to reflect the hard work (with a wink towards Marxist uses of the term in English!) and “heroes” so that readers can (hopefully!) draw connections with similar English discourses and literary works on the hypocritical “celebration” of exploited and underappreciated groups (perhaps healthcare workers during COVID, or soldiers who marched during marching into World War I).

abio: "<p>\nZhang Ergun (lit. “Zhang second stick/rod”) is a Chinese poet from Shanxi
  province. Born in 1982 into a family of modest means, Zhang attended vocational
  school for a year after graduating middle school. Working as a member of a provincial
  geologic surveying team, Zhang spent decades of his life traveling to remote areas
  and living among impoverished individuals. His poems are known for their simplicity,
  sincerity, social criticism, and compassion for the powerless and the poor. He has
  published one collection of poems, 《<span lang= \"zh\">旷野</span>》(lit. <em>Open
  Wilderness</em>) and was honored with a Mao Dun Literary Newcomer Award in the late
  winter of 2021.\n</p>\n<p>\nCritic and fellow poet Liu Nian (<span lang= \"zh\">刘年</span>)
  noted that Zhang’s poetry is representative of what he considers to be the “Chinese
  school” of contemporary Chinese poetry. According to Liu, the school – and Zhang’s
  works – follow the literary tradition of classical Chinese poetry while drawing
  inspiration from Western philosophy. Poems from the school feature simple prose,
  grounded realism, and compassion for all. \n</p>"
tbio: "<p>\nKejia Wang graduated from Penn in 2016 with a BSE in bioengineering and
  a minor in English. She has since also received an MA degree in English Literature
  with a concentration in Science and Technology Studies from the University of British
  Columbia, Vancouver. She currently resides in Vancouver, where she splits her time
  between working as an analyst in the Canadian public health sector and as a remote
  English localization specialist for a Chinese video game studio. Her poem \"Disorientation\"
  was published in the <em>Penn Review</em> in 2015, and she has contributed translations
  of Chinese poems to <em>Doublespeak</em> since 2014. \n</p>"
