author: Stella N’Djoku
translator: Julia Pelosi-Thorpe
poem: "Se io e tu \nnon fossimo io e tu \nchi saremmo esattamente e cosa \ndirebbero
  di noi le mani, questi \ncorpi. Saremmo  \nlo stesso incastro? Potremmo, \nio e
  tu, riconoscerci tra mille, \nsarebbero dello stesso blu il cielo e \nle correnti,
  \nse io non fossi io e tu non fossi tu? \nNon lo so, ma che ci importa? In \nfondo
  \nio sono io e tu sei tu.\n\n\nÈ per sempre \nl’eterna carezza \nluce, grattacieli
  \ncome spighe di grano.  \nOggi non basta nulla  \nle ali le stelle \nl’agosto di
  fuochi  \nmagnetici al cielo.\n\n\nNon ti hanno visto \nche nelle foto a colori
  \nnelle storie \nche racconti modificate di volta in volta \nper non dimenticare.
  \nMa avremmo detto tutto di te \nle stesse linee degli occhi \nla certezza di esistere."
transpoem: "If you and I \nweren’t you and I \nwho’d we be exactly and what would\nour
  hands say about us, these \nbodies. Would we be \nthe same seam? Could we, \nyou
  and I, recognize ourselves in a thousand, \nwould the sky and streams be the  \nsame
  blue, \nif I weren’t I and you weren’t you?\nI don’t know, and what is it to us?
  At \nheart \nI’m I and you’re you.\n\n\nAn unending caress\nis forever \nlight,
  skyscrapers \nlike wheat stalks. \nToday nothing’s enough \nwings, stars,\nan August
  of fires\nmagnetized skyward.\n\n\nThey haven’t seen you \nexcept in color photos
  \nin stories \nthat change each time they’re told\nso as not to forget. \nBut we’d
  have articulated all of you \nthe same lines near the eyes \nthe certainty of existing."

  <p>The second two of these three poems by Stella N’Djoku can be found in her debut collection <em>Il tempo di una cometa</em> (Edizioni Ensemble, 2019). The first poem forms part of the new book she is assembling.</p>
  <p>N’Djoku’s modern elegies traverse cycles of intergenerational grief and rebirth. In these three texts, her poetic speakers question their relationships with other humans as well as with the ever-changing seasons of the natural and animal worlds. Here, flux and stasis, memory and forgetfulness, life and death, entwine.</p>
  <p>Caresses can be eternal. Someone only seen in photographs can live on through being articulated. Our organs can be composed of shells and stars.</p>
  <p>From my very first encounter with N’Djoku’s verse — in an anthology of poems responding to the pandemic (<em>Dal sottovuoto: poesie assetate d’aria</em>, Samuele Editore, April 2020) — I was enchanted. In interpreting her beautiful, elusive rhythm, I hope to match N’Djoku’s movements as closely as I can while accepting their ultimate untranslatability. It is inspiring to watch my English reach a place of such elegance through correspondence with N’Djoku’s words.</p>
  <p>For me, each translation is an approximation, and I carve out many paths initially. I find it so difficult to then choose some above others. This is one of the reasons I engage in retranslations,  revisiting the same poems with different approaches over the years. I hope to retranslate these poems one day too.</p>
