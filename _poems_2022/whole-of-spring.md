pid: whole-of-spring
title: La primavera entera
transtitle: Whole of Spring
author: Idea Vilariño
translator: Maria Lourdes Riillo
poem: "La primavera entera  \ncon palomas y tallos y huracanes \ncon baldes de agua
  tibia  \ncon una mariposa corpulenta \naleteando afelpada  \ncon un jardín un bosque
  una floresta  \npoblada de humedad y hojas podridas \ny fragancias y vahos y vaharadas
  \ \ny raíces feroces y qué no  \ntodo la primavera se volcaba  \nrespirando sumiéndose
  \nalentando en mi lecho. \n"
transpoem: "The whole of spring \nwith doves and stems and hurricanes \nwith buckets
  of warm water \nwith a plump butterfly  \ncushioned fluttering \nwith a garden a
  forest a grove \noverrun with humidity and dead leaves \nand smells and fog and
  breath \nand feral roots and whatnot\nthe whole of spring would tip over \ngasping,
  plunging  \npulsing in my riverbed."
note: "<p>I decided to translate the title as “The Whole of Spring” rather than just
  “The Whole Spring” because I feel “The Whole Spring” is tied to time, while “the
  whole of” something is the entity of spring. It seems “The Whole of Spring” is against
  the poem’s speaker; something that is supposed to be full of life, full of new beginnings,
  is crushing her. It’s deceiving. One line I had trouble translating was “alentando
  afelpada” because I couldn’t find a suitable word I liked for <em>afelpada</em>,
  and it was difficult to maintain the musicality of both words in Spanish. I went
  with “cushioned fluttering,” because it produced the image I saw of a beautiful
  lush butterfly.  Every part of spring infiltrates her to her core. I love how quickly
  the poem turns, how quickly something so beautiful turns so ugly, and how quickly
  it buries itself deep within us.</p>"
abio: "<p>Idea Vilariño (1920–2009) was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, where she lived
  all her life. She was a poet, essayist, and literary critic who belonged to the
  “Generation of ’45,” an intellectual literary movement in Latin America. She was
  also a translator, namely one of the most celebrated Shakespeare translators into
  Spanish, a high school teacher, and a composer. She was born into a middle-class
  family, and was highly educated both in literature and music. Her published works
  include <em>La suplicante</em>, <em>No</em>, and <em>Pobre mundo</em>, among others.
  She has been recognized locally in Uruguay, regionally in Latin America, and internationally;
  her work has been translated into many languages. Vilarino’s work is marked by intimate
  experiences, intense and distressing, but always very coherent. Her collection,
  <em>Poemas de amor</em>, from which this translated poem originates, was dedicated
  to a contemporary well-known Uruguayan writer, Juan Carlos Onetti. The two had a
  tumultuous, on-and-off relationship. Even though they were never married or officially
  together, she claimed that he was the greatest love of her life. The frustration
  of lost love, of what could have been, resonated with me during this last year.
