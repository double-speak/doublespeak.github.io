poem: "<h2>I</h2>\nЛюбит? не любит? Я руки ломаю\nи пальцы \n \nразбрасываю разломавши
  \n\n\nтак рвут загадав и пускают \n \nпо маю \n\n\nвенчики встречных ромашек\nпускай
  седины обнаруживает стрижка и бритье\nПусть серебро годов вызванивает\nуймою \n\n\n\n\nнадеюсь
  верую вовеки не придет\nко мне позорное благоразумие\n\n<h2>II</h2>\nУже второй\n
  \         должно быть ты легла\nА может быть\nи у тебя такое\nЯ не \nспешу\n          И
  молниями телеграмм\nмне незачем\nтебя\nбудить и беспокоить\n\n<h2>III</h2>\nморе
  уходит вспять\nморе уходит спать\nКак говорят инцидент исперчен\nлюбовная лодка
  разбилась о быт\nС тобой мы в расчете\nИ не к чему перечень\nвзаимных болей бед
  и обид\n\n<h2>IV</h2>\nУже второй должно быть ты легла\nВ ночи Млечпуть серебряной
  Окою\nЯ не спешу и молниями телеграмм\nМне незачем тебя будить и беспокоить\nкак
  говорят инцидент исперчен\nлюбовная лодка разбилась о быт\nС тобой мы в расчете
  и не к чему перечень\nвзаимных болей бед и обид\nТы посмотри какая в мире тишь\nНочь
  обложила небо звездной данью \nв такие вот часы встаешь и говоришь\nвекам истории
  и мирозданию\n\n<h2>V</h2>\nЯ знаю силу слов я знаю слов набат\nОни не те которым
  рукоплещут ложи\nОт слов таких срываются гроба\nшагать четверкою своих дубовых ножек\nБывает
  выбросят не напечатав не издав\nНо слово мчится подтянув подпруги\nзвенит века и
  подползают поезда\nлизать поэзии мозолистые руки\nЯ знаю силу слов Глядится пустяком\nОпавшим
  лепестком под каблуками танца\nНо человек душой губами костяком\n\n \n \n\n\n"
transpoem: "<h2>I</h2>\nShe loves me? She loves me not? I break my hands\nand fingers,
  \nscatter \n     and shatter, \nas the others seize \nand release \ntête-à-tête
  petals of daisy\ninto May. \n\nlet a haircut and shave reveal\nthe gray \nlet silver
  ages \nresound \nall \nthe way\nbut without ever bringing me, \nI hope, I believe—\nthe
  shameful prudence. \n\n<h2>II</h2>\nIt’s almost two o’clock  \n                you
  must have gone to sleep\nBut maybe\nlike me, you also—\nAlas, I won’t rush it\nAnd
  with the lightning of a telegram— \nno, I have no reason \nto awake and disturb
  \nyou\n\n<h2>III</h2>\nThe sea goes to sleep\nThe sea goes—freeze\nLike they say,
  the incident is settled—spoiled and soured \nLove’s gondola crashed against the
  mundane \nWith you all accounts have been sealed \nNo point in tallying up mutual
  pain and hurt and grief\n\n<h2>IV</h2>\nit’s almost two o’clock you must’ve gone
  to sleep \nat night the Milkyway looks like a silver river\ni won’t rush it and
  with the lightning of a telegram\ni have no reason to awake and disturb you\nas
  they say the incident is settled and spoiled and soured \nlove’s gondola crashed
  against the mundane \nwith you all accounts have been sealed there’s no point tallying
  up\nmutual pain and hurt and grief \nyou see how in the world reigns silence\nnight
  imposed tribute on the sky in the form of constellation\nat such an hour you rise
  and speak\nto centuries and history and universe creation\n\n<h2>V</h2>\nI know
  the power of words I know the words’ penetrating voice \nThey are not the ones applauded
  by the theater boxes \nFrom such words coffins break free from the earth \nand with
  their four feet of oak stride forth\nThey could be discarded unprinted unpublished
  – it happens, \nBut with tightened reins the word races forward \nand rings for
  centuries and trains crawl up  \nto lick the callused hands of poetry\nI know the
  power of words. A seeming trifle\nlike fallen petals under dancing heels,\nbut with
  lips and a soul – is a man with a backbone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

  <p>Poem III is the most well-known and perhaps also most well-crafted poem within this series. It opens with a rhymed couplet about the sea, which is extremely difficult to translate, because it not only introduces the water imagery that will be elaborated by the metaphor of the love boat after a few lines, but also references a popular Russian children’s game that finds no parallels in Anglophone culture. In this game, a chosen <em>водящий</em> chants: «Море волнуется раз, море волнуется два…морская фигура на месте замри!» Игроки в это время раскачиваются и кружатся, но при слове «замри», они должные замирать в позе, otherwise they would lose. Due to the lack of similar games in English whose name keeps the water imagery, I decide to keep a literal translation for the first half of these lines (<em>море уходит</em> – “the sea goes”), but tweak the second half to create rhymed endings, especially with the use of the word “freeze” at the end to evoke the chant featured in the children’s game. The dash I put between “goes” and “freeze” allows for multiple interpretations: in context of the game, it could emphasize the abruptness of the action, when the game leader suddenly chants “морская фигура на месте замри!”; if we disregard the game reference, “freeze” can be conceived as synonymous as “sleep,” and the dash could suggest a long, dragged-out process during which the relationship, like the freezing sea, becomes cold and stagnant.</p>
  <p>Mayakovsky coins the word <em>исперчен</em> from several similar sounding words: <em>исчерпен</em> (“to settle”), <em>испорчен</em> (“to spoil”), and <em>перчить</em> (“to pepper”). As there is no single English word to capture all these layers of meanings, I decided to use three words to be true to the complexity of Mayakovsky’s diction here. I used alliteration to create a sense of coherence amongst this three adjectives that were bred from the same source word (<em>исперчен</em>), and a dash in between to elucidate the logic: the incident looks like it has been settled, but in fact it has been spoiled and soured. In the ensuing lines, I translated <em>в расчете</em> as “all accounts have been sealed.” I thought about translating it as “we’re even,” which would be more idiomatic, but I decided to reflect the shared <em>че</em> root in <em>исперчен</em> and <em>расчете</em> (as well as in <em>перечень</em> in the next line) by extending the alliteration from “settled/spoiled/soured” to “sealed.” These <em>чень</em>/</em>чет</em> roots establish the motif of counting, which is centralized in this poem, most notably through the ideas of <em>расчет</em> (in my translation, “accounts”) and <em>перечень</em> (in my translation, “tallying up”), but also hinted through the children’s game (the counting in “Море волнуется раз… два… три…”). One finds this motif of counting even in the beginning of the first poem, when the lovers count off flower petals to make guesses about love.</p>
  <p>As for the iconic refrain, at the time of Mayakovsky’s writing, there were few options of entertainment for the youth, and lovers often go on boat rides in the parks. To highlight this particular phenomenon, I translated <em>лодка</em> to not the more intuitive and literal answer – “boat” – but to “gondola,” which is a particular type of boat rented often by lovers to roam around the city of Venice in leisure, to evoke images of idealized romance associated with <em>любовная лодка</em>, as opposed to the harsh realism of the Soviet <em>быт</em>. The word <em>быт</em> itself is almost untranslatable. However, I also do not want to leave it untranslated, since readers without a Russian background would hardly understand what it means; the use of a footnote is possible, but would interrupt the rhythm of the poetry-reading experience. I considered “life,” “existence,” “being,” but all of them seem too broad and nonsensical in the context of this line. I eventually chose “mundane” to sharpen and focalize the contrast with what the <em>любовная лодка</em> represents.</p>
  <p>As I translate these poems, I follow Mayakovsky along his journey of the mind and of the soul, in his frustrations as both a lover and a poet. We would never know why he eventually decided to commit suicide, having written these last lines that suggest optimism and self-respect (as a man with a backbone). Perhaps the pressure from the dancing heels was too much to bear; perhaps the love boat crashing against the mundane was too devastating. I do not know, but from reading Mayakovsky, what I have learned is the power of words to create, to destroy, to persist, and to transform, as his words still – as he himself predicted – race forward and ring in our world today.</p>
abio: "<p>Renowned as one of the most prominent figures of the Russian Futurist movement
  and the Russian Revolution, Vladimir Mayakovsky produced a diverse body of work
  during his career: he wrote poems, directed plays, appeared in films, edited journals,
  and created posters in support of the Communist Party. Though Mayakovsky’s work
  regularly demonstrated ideological and patriotic support for the revolutionary ideology,
  Mayakovsky's relationship with the Soviet state was always complex and often tumultuous.
  In 1930, Mayakovsky died by suicide at the age of thirty-seven in his apartment,
  which shocked the Soviet world. Joseph Stalin described Mayakovsky after his death
  as “the best and the most talented poet of our Soviet epoch.” What I have chosen
  to translate and annotate is Mayakovsky’s incomplete and unpublished poem cycle
  found in his apartment, presumably his last work before suicide.</p>"
