transpoem: "“Let’s die together,”\nWhispered to me on that\nNight of fireflies\n\n„Sollen
  wir sterben?“\nhast du geflüstert, an der\nNacht des Glühwürmchens.\n\n“zullen we
  samen sterven?”\r\nFluisterde je naar me\r\nOp de nacht van glimwormpjes. \r\n\n«Allons-nous
  mourir?»\r\nIl a été chuchoté\r\nLa nuit de luciole\r\n\n«andiamo a morire insieme?»\r\nviene
  sussurrato a me\r\nla notte della lucciola\r\n\n“¿Moriremos juntos?”\r\nMe susurraste
  \r\nLa noche de candelilla\r\n\n“같이 죽을까?”\r\n너는 속삭였었지\r\n반딧불의 밤에.\r\n\n同生共死\r\n悄悄地说\r\n萤火虫之夜\r\n\n"

  <p>Masajo Suzuki’s haiku describes her impossible affair with a married man. As their love is forbidden, they contemplate death in their pursuit of an authentic life in the middle of a meadow lit by fireflies. Our translations, in turn, sought to capture the intense romanticism and desperation imbued in the poem. In the Korean version, for example, the suffix <span lang="ko">였었지</span> was selected as it imparts a sense of strained remembrance, of one looking back at something that will never come back. Similarly, in choosing a word for “whisper,” the Spanish translation landed on <em>susurrar</em> due to its layered meaning of “whisper, murmur, or sigh” — all actions that invoke a sort of longing or want. The first line of the Chinese translation included a Chinese idiom or <em>chengyu</em>, lending a slightly more romantic tone to the poem.</p> <p>Haikus are an aesthetic art form, one predicated on perfect rhythm and capturing moments of intense beauty and pain. It was hence important to translate it in a way that would appeal to the readers’ senses but also convey the whispering and gentle nature of the night and lovers’ conversations. This led to decisions such as the selection of the Italian word <em>insieme</em> (“together”) instead of <em>con me</em> (“with me”) since the former has a nicer sound and echoes the preceding words <em>andare</em> and <em>morire</em>. Such questions of sonority particularly surfaced when translating the word for “firefly.” Both <em>luciole</em> (French) and <em>candelilla</em> (Spanish) were chosen due to their soft mouthfeel and ability to invoke a strong connotation of light. In the Dutch translation, the diminutive <em>glimwormpjes</em> was chosen over <em>glimwormen</em> to ensure that the reader was presented with an image of tiny, sparkling lights instead of a large firefly.</p>
  <p>Haikus are distinguished by their 5-7-5 pattern: five syllables for the first line, seven for the second, and five for the third. Some languages were able to retain this form better than others. The French translation was able to retain the syllable counts by assuming the poem would be read in the traditional French style, where each syllable is enunciated. The English version also maintained the traditional Haiku structure. On the other hand, other translations, such as the Spanish one, decided to forgo the 5-7-5 pattern in order to avoid enjambment and ensure that each line conveyed a separate thought.</p> <p>Furthermore, the poem is imbued with passivity, further heightening the soft despair of the poetic voice. The first line, “<span lang="ja">死なうかと</span>,” is a phonetically archaic version of the Japanese “shall we?” form with the <span lang="ja">と</span> at the end implying that it is being said to another person. Certain versions such as the French and Korean translation retained this passivity by recognizing that the “we” is implied by the <span lang="ko">같이</span> (“together”) in the first line. Other translations, however, decided to write in a more active tone to avoid an abundance of syllables and to emulate the directness of a conversation between two lovers. For example, the Italian version settled on <em>andiamo</em> (“we go”) over <em>vorresti</em> (“would you like to”) or <em>dovremo</em> (“shall we”) because the latter choices are too distant and polite.</p>
  <p>Through specific decisions related to diction and rhythm, we hope that our translations evoke the same painful longing that only forbidden love can bring.</p>
abio: "<p>Masajo Suzuki (1906–2003) is a renowned haiku poet hailing from Kamogawa,
  Japan. In addition to successfully running several business ventures, she formally
  studied haiku under the guidance of masters Hakusuiro, Mantaro Kubota, and Anju
  Atsushi. Suzuki’s work is renowned for its tenderness and swells with originality
  and depth. Often drawing from her personal experiences with divorce and the loss
  of loved ones, her poems wrestle with concepts related to love, nature, and human
  existence. Her work has received critical acclaim, garnering awards such as the
  Poet Association Award for her fourth book <em>Yûboraru</em>, the Yomiuri Literature
  Prize for her sixth book <em>Miyakodori</em>, and the Dakotsushou Prize for her
  seventh book <em>Shimokuren</em>. Although she passed away peacefully at the age
  of ninety-six, the universality and authenticity of her work still resonates with
  her readers who cannot help but become entranced by the evocative imagery of her
  poetry.</p>"

  it does in French, <em>frileuse</em>. For those reasons, here, we use “untranslatable”
  to mean untranslatable into English, as that is a language with which all of our
  staff members are familiar, or without equivalent in other languages that we know.</p>"
