poem: "姐姐，今夜我在德令哈，夜色笼罩\n姐姐，我今夜只有戈壁\n\n草原尽头我两手空空\n悲痛时握不住一颗泪滴\n姐姐，今夜我在德令哈\n这是雨水中一座荒凉的城\n\n除了那些路过的和居住的\n德令哈┄┄今夜\n这是唯一的，最后的，抒情。\n这是唯一的，最后的，草原。\n我把石头还给石头\n让胜利的胜利\n今夜青稞只属于她自己\n一切都在生长\n今夜我只有美丽的戈壁
  空空\n姐姐，今夜我不关心人类，我只想你\n \n1988.7.25 火车经德令哈\n"
transpoem: "Sister, tonight I am in Delingha, enveloped in darkness\nSister, tonight
  I only have the Gobi Desert\n \nAt the edge of the prairie I stand with empty hands\nBarely
  gripping a single tear when sadness strikes\nSister, tonight I am in Delingha\nIt’s
  a desolate city drenched in rain\n\nExcept for those passengers and residents,\nDelingha—tonight,\nThis
  is the only, the last, lyric.\nThis is the only, the last, prairie.\nI give rocks
  back to the rocks\nLet the victory belong to victory\nTonight the highland barley
  only belongs to herself\nEverything is growing\nBut tonight I only have the beautiful
  Gobi Desert, nothing\nelse\nSister, tonight I don’t care about mankind,\nI think
  of nothing but you\n7/25/1988 Train passing by Delingha\n"
note: |-
  <p>I chose this poem by Haizi not only because its depiction of “loneliness” deeply resonated with me, but also because of its imagery and rhythm, both of which I tried to preserve in my translation. <span lang=”zh”>《日记》 </span>(“Diary”) opens with the scene of the poet writing to his sister from the desert in a rainy and lonely night. The imagery of him standing alone facing the vast prairie just struck me when I was reading the poem for the first time. Haizi’s loneliness further develops as he describes that everything else is growing yet he owns nothing. The poem ends with my favorite line as the poet abandons his usual praise of nature and care of creatures. Rather, Haizi shows us a more personal and vulnerable side of him — a younger brother who misses his sister badly in a lonely desert.</p>
  <p>One of my main challenges in translating this poem is knowing what is important and what is not. For the second line in the second stanza, “<span lang=”zh”>悲痛时握不住一颗泪滴</span>,” some translations that I have found were stressing on translating <span lang=”zh”>颗</span>, a measure word for small round objects. But to me, the most important information in the sentence is the verb <span lang=”zh”>握</span>, which means “grip.” “Grip” is not a verb that is typically associated with tears; we normally say “wipe one’s tears.” The phrase “gripping one’s tears” includes the idea of the measure word <span lang=”zh”>颗</span> since it implies the metaphor that his teardrops are like glass balls. This imagery vividly depicts how hard the poet cries since his sadness materializes into something solid that can be grappled. “Grip” also reflects the pain that he is experiencing as he tightens his fingers and makes a fist.</p>
abio: "<p>Haizi (<span lang=”zh”>海子</span>) (1964–1989) was a famous Chinese poet
  known for his Romantic style. He was raised in rural Anhui Province. At the age
  of fifteen, Haizi was enrolled in Peking University and majored in law. When he
  was twenty-three, he became a philosophy lecturer at China University of Political
  Science and Law. He was a prolific poet and completed works of about two million
  words between 1982 and 1989, a lot of them still popular to this day. Some of Haizi’s
  well-known works include “Asian Copper” (<span lang=”zh”>《亚洲铜》</span>), “Motherland,
  or Dream as a Horse” (<span lang=”zh”>《祖国，或以梦为马》</span>), “Facing the Sea, with
  Spring Blooms” (<span lang=”zh”>《面朝大海，春暖花开》</span>). Major themes that appear in
  Haizi’s works include land/village, darkness/light, and death. His poems are expressive,
  emotional and powerful. On March 6, 1989, Haizi committed suicide on a train track,
  eight months after he wrote the poem <span lang=”zh”>《日记》</span>(“Diary”) on a train.</p>"
