  暗蓝之夜
  旧创一起迸发
  床再煎烤这些往事时
  是极有耐心的情人
  台钟滴滴嗒嗒
  将梦蹂躏得体无完肤
  沿墙摸索
  沿墙摸索一根拉线开关
  却无意缠住了
  一绺月色
  鳞鳞银鱼闻味而来缘根而上
  你终于
  柔软一池
  在一个缓慢的转身里
  你看着你
  你看着你
  穿衣镜故作无辜一厢纯情
  暧昧的贴墙纸将花纹模糊着
  被坚硬地框住
  眼看你自己一瓣一瓣地凋落

  你无从逃脱无从逃脱
  即使能倒纵过一堵堵墙
  仍有一个个纵不过的日子堵在身后

  女人不需要哲理
  女人可以摔落月的色斑，如
  狗抖去水
  拉上厚窗帘
  黎明湿漉漉的舌头搭上窗玻璃
  回到枕头的凹痕去
  像一卷曝过光的胶卷
  将你自己散放着
  窗下的核桃树很响地瑟缩了一下
  似乎被一只冰凉的手摸过
transpoem: "Midnight blue\nIndigo hidden wounds \nburst — \nThe bed, simmering the
  past,\nbecame an extremely patient lover.\nThe clock sat; its arms tick-tocked,\nbullying
  the dreams until they crumbled.\nAlong the wall — \nAlong the wall I groped\nfor
  the light cord, but tangled with a wisp\nthe color of the moon\nlike tiny shimmering
  silver fishes\nnibbling their way up to trace the source, and finally— \n\nYou —
  \nsoftness overflows a pool\n\n        In the turning of a body:\n        You watching
  \          you\n        You           watching you\n\nThe dressing mirror feigns
  a lovesick child.\nWallpaper smears the printed flora, flirtingly,\nand solidly
  framed.\nYou watch yourself wither, a petal, another…\nYou don’t get to get out.\n\nYou
  get lucky, break free from several walls,\nbut you cannot break free from the days
  and years\nthat pile up behind you.\n\nYou women need no philosophy.\nYou women
  can shake off the shadows of the moon like\nhow dogs shake off water.\n\nDraw close
  the thick curtain\nThe tongue of the dawn dampens the window\nHead placed back to
  the sunken spot of the pillow\nYou scatter yourself\nlike exposed film.\nOutside
  the window, the shivering walnut tree shrieks\ndisturbed by an ice-cold hand.\n"
note: <p>I took a more experimental approach while working with this poem, and I am
  aware that some of the literal meanings in the Chinese poem do not exactly match
  up with the translation. I took this approach because this poem contains a lot of
  ambiguities, and I wanted to preserve a certain amount of this ambiguity without
  completely disassociating from my own interpretation of the poem. For example, in
  my translation, I formatted “<span lang="zh">你看着你/你看着你</span>” with a series of
  extra spaces, though they were not intended in the original poem. In Chinese, the
  circularity of the line comes not only from the repetition of “you,” but also the
  similarity of form between the characters <span lang="zh">看</span> and <span lang="zh">着</span>.
  Therefore, I emphasize such formal circularity by rendering the spaces in those
  two lines. Another example of a place where I was more experimental in my translation
  is the line “like tiny shimmering silver fishes / nibbling their way up to trace
  the source.” The notion of “nibbling” was not present in the original poem, but
  the poet’s use of <span lang="zh">闻味</span> signified the blindly primal nature
  of the fish’s movements, and I considered “nibbling” to be a good alternative to
  signifying such primal nature.</p>
abio: <p>Shu Ting (<span lang="zh">舒婷</span>) is from Fujian, China. She is usually
  associated with the Misty Poets. She was born in 1952, and during the Cultural Revolution,
  was sent to the Chinese countryside because of her family’s political ideology.
  She returned to Fujian in 1972 and spent time working in factories for her livelihood.
  Her poems gained popularity in the 1980s, and around that time, she did a joint
  collection of poetry with Gu Cheng, another prominent Misty poet. Shu is well known
  in China and the rest of the world for her poems “To the Oak” and “Dear Motherland,”
  in which conflict and pain are present but positivity blooms. “Mirror” is one of
  her less well-known poems, and it gives us a glimpse into the poet’s private life.</p>
tbio: "<p>Shuke Zeng is an undergraduate student at Penn. She majors in English and
  statistics. Chinese is her native language, and she remembers being forced to memorize
  Chinese poems when she was a child. She only gained the tools to decode those poems
  deeply engraved in her memory after taking poetry classes in the English department
  at Penn. Shu Ting has been one of her favorite Chinese poets since childhood, and
  working on the translation of this poem has allowed her to revisit some qualities
  of Shu Ting’s poems and the Chinese language that she has always been drawn to.</p>"
