author: Yi Sang-hwa
translator: Emily Yoon
poem: |-
  물장수가 귓속으로 들어와 내 눈을 열었다.
  보아라!
  까치가 뼈만 남은 나뭇가지에서 울음을 운다.
  왜 이래?
  서리가 덩달아 추녀끝으로 눈물을 흘리는가.
  내야 반가웁기만 하다. 오늘은 따스하겠구나.
transpoem: |-
  The water-seller came through my ears and opened my eyes.
  Look!
  The magpie cries on the branch down to its bone.
  Why?
  The frost follows suit and drops tears through the eaves’ corners.
  Of course I welcome this. It shall be warm today.
note: "<p>I translated these poems a few years ago, in an attempt to “get to know”
  Yi, and thereby the literary atmosphere of the colonial period, better. I was initially
  attracted to the lyricism of his most famous poem, “Ppaeatkin Tŭredo Pomŭn Onŭn’ga”
  (1926; trans. “Does Spring Come Even to Stolen Fields?”), and wanted to read more
  of his work. Translating these poems and spending time with the language helped
  me ask further and more engaged questions about certain imagery and diction, knowing
  the historical context in which the poems were produced.</p>"

  <p>Yi Sang-hwa (<span lang="ko">이상화</span>,1901–1943) was a colonial-era poet. His work is known for its proletarian and resistance spirit, despite censorship and pressure from the Japanese authorities.</p>

  <p>His involvement in the liberation movement began when he was just a teenager. In 1919 in Daegu, the city of his birth, he and his friends started organizing a student uprising as part of the March First Independence Movement. It ultimately failed when the police found out their plans ,and Yi had to go into hiding for some time.</p>

  <p>His literary debut was a few years later in 1922, when his first poetry publications appeared in <em>Paekcho</em>, a short-lived literary magazine known for publishing romanticist poetry with themes of despair, desperation, and death. In 1925, he became one of the first members of the arts organization KAPF (Korea Artista Proletara Federatio), which, as the name suggests, promoted proletarian ideals.</p>

  <p>In 1937, he went to China for three months to visit his brother Yi Sang-chŏng, an independence fighter, and was arrested by the Japanese police upon return. He was released after eight months.</p>

  <p>Afterward, he worked as a teacher as well as an amateur boxer. He quit in 1940 to focus on reading and research. He translated a classic novel <em>The Tale of Chunhyang</em> into English, and began working on other French translation projects, but died before finishing them; he passed away in Daegu, in 1943, after suffering from stomach cancer.</p>
