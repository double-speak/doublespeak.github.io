transtitle: Farewell Violin
author: Émile Nelligan
translator: Aylin Malcolm
poem: |
  Vous jouiez Mendelssohn ce soir-là; les flammèches
  Valsaient dans l’âtre clair, cependant qu’au salon
  Un abat-jour mêlait en ondulement long
  Ses rêves de lumière au châtain de vos mèches.

  Et tristes, comme un bruit frissonnant de fleurs sèches
  Éparses dans le vent vespéral du vallon,
  Les notes sanglotaient sur votre violon
  Et chaque coup d’archet trouait mon cœur de brèches.

  Or, devant qu’il se fût fait tard, je vous quittai.
  Mais jusqu’à l’aube errant, seul, morose, attristé,
  Contant ma jeune peine au lunaire mystère,

  Je sentais remonter comme d’amers parfums
  Ces musiques d’adieu qui scellaient sous la terre
  Et mon rêve d’amour et mes espoirs défunts.
transpoem: |
  You played Mendelssohn that evening; ashes
  Waltzed in the radiant hearth and filled the air;
  The lampshade shed its dappled dreams; flashes
  Flooded the room and limned your chestnut hair.

  Those mournful melodies wept from your violin,
  Trembling like withered flowers torn apart
  And scattered on the evening valley wind;
  Each stroke of the bow carved cracks in my heart.

  And then, as it grew late, I took my leave.
  But until dawn — errant, morose, and grieved,
  Lamenting my foolish pain to the cryptic moon —

  I felt those notes drift back like bitter perfumes:
  That farewell music which left me bereaved
  And sealed my dream of love inside its tomb.
note: "<p>To preserve this poem’s liveliness in the quicker rhythms of the English
  language, I have altered the rhyme scheme and translated Nelligan’s alexandrine
  lines into a more familiar pentameter. Where possible, I have retained or introduced
  alliteration and assonance, devices that were common in Symbolist poetry. Overall,
  I have strived to convey the original poem’s combination of formal regularity with
  irrepressible emotion, as well as the enjambment throughout the poem that highlights
  this tension. Formally and thematically, “Violon D’Adieu” expresses youthful energy
  and feelings exceeding the bounds of propriety, making it an apt introduction to
  Émile Nelligan’s poetry.</p>"
abio: |-
  <p>Although his work is rarely translated or read outside the province, Émile Nelligan (1879–1941) is a major figure in Québécois literature and a representative example of the Symbolist tradition. This late-nineteenth-century art movement, a reaction to the Realist movement’s emphasis on the mundane details of everyday life, privileged imaginative flights of fancy and vivid imagery. Symbolist poets were keenly interested in synaesthetic experiences, exemplified by Nelligan’s conflation of sound and scent in the final lines of “Violon D’Adieu,” and in expressions of extreme emotion (often verging on melodrama), such as Paul Verlaine’s “Il pleure dans mon cœur / Comme il pleut sur la ville” (“It rains in my heart / Like it rains on the city”).</p>

  <p>Like the French Symbolist Arthur Rimbaud, Nelligan was a precocious poet whose career both began and ended early. After publishing his first poems at the age of sixteen, he dropped out of school and joined a group of bohemian writers (the École littéraire de Montréal), often giving recitations at their meetings. His poetry was well received during this period, but in 1899 he began to exhibit erratic behaviour, including hallucinations and suicide attempts. His parents — who had never supported his writing pursuits — arranged for him to be institutionalized at the age of nineteen, bringing a halt to his poetic output. This unfortunate turn of events may clarify some of the distinctive features of Nelligan’s poetry, which stands out as particularly gloomy and pessimistic compared to that of other Symbolists. Yet there are moments of transcendence amid the darkness: strains of music, flashes of gold, and — unsurprisingly for a Montréal poet — the peaceful silence of snow.</p>
