transtitle: a sun did not rise
author: Mansur Al-Hallaj
translator: Michael Karam
poem: |
  والله ما طلعت شمسٌ ولا غربت
  إلا وحبّـك مقـرون بأنفاسـي
  ولا خلوتُ إلى قوم أحدّثهــم
  إلا وأنت حديثي بين جلاســي
  ولا ذكرتك محزوناً ولا فَرِحًا
  إلا وأنت بقلبي بين وسواســـي
  ولا هممت بشرب الماء من عطش
  إلا رَأَيْتُ خيالاً منك في الكـــأس
  ولو قدرتُ على الإتيان جئتـُكم
  سعياً على الوجه أو مشياً على الرأس
  ويا فتى الحيّ إن غّنيت لي طربا
  فغّنـني وأسفا من قلبك القاســـي
  ما لي وللناس كم يلحونني سفها
  ديني لنفسي ودين الناس للنـــاس

  الحسين بن منصور الحلاج
transpoem: "I swear to god, a sun did not rise or set \n        unless your love was
  woven into my breath \nand I could not be myself fully \n        unless I brought
  you up between each sentence \nand I did not mention you, gladly or sadly \n        unless
  you were in my heart among my demons \nand I did not care to quench my thirst \n
  \       unless I saw your reflection in the glass \nand if I could come to you I
  would \n        seeking you headfirst or walking upside down \nand oh! Boy in the
  street, if you sing a ballad for me \n        sing it softly and sorrily from your
  stone heart \nPeople call me an abomination — what do I care? \n        My beliefs
  are my beliefs and theirs are theirs. \n"

  <p>At a time when Iraqis are dying in the streets as they protest for a better life, I wanted to choose a poem that can remind readers of a different Iraq we rarely hear about in the news.</p>
  <p>The verses of the poem are written in pairs, which I tried to mimic in English. While al-Hallaj uses a combination of the past tense and nonverbal sentences to indicate an element of timelessness and permanence in his poem, I resort to writing entirely in the past. English lacks nonverbal sentence structures, so I settled for the past’s intransient nature.</p>
  <p>In more than one way, the translation strips the poem of the connotations that defy religion. While the original starts with “and Allah” and ends with a statement about how “my religion” is different than “the people’s religion,” I have liberally written the poem about an obsessive love, one that defies the people’s <em>beliefs</em>. In the poem’s final verse, the poet uses <span lang=”ar”> دين</span>, which literally means “religion,” but I have interpreted it not as a reference to structured schools of faith but to the purest form of a religion: beliefs.</p>
  <p>Where the translation reads “boy in the street,” the original actually says “boy of the neighborhood.” I wanted to translate that as “boy next door,” a type of character that is young, nosy, and watches over the neighborhood or naturally knows all that’s going on. I felt, however, that it carried a connotation of some type of love affair, and I did not want to overtly imply that the poem is about a man or boy. Simply, the verse addresses the boy in a call for sympathy as he sings the speaker’s ballad.</p>
  <p>This brings me to the topic of gender. Arabic is a gendered language, and the original poem is addressed to a male “you.” Nonetheless, that doesn’t mean the speaker is addressing a man. This is simply a feature of traditional Ghazali poetry. I wanted to maintain this gendered ambiguity in English, giving the listener the chance to imagine who the subject of this obsessive, controversial love is.</p>
abio: <p>Al-Hallaj (Abu el-Mughith al-Husayn bin Mansur al-Hallaj, 858 CE–922 CE)
  was born in modern-day Iran and executed in modern-day Iraq. A Sufi mystic from
  the Abbasid era, al-Hallaj’s widely followed preaching inspired a movement of political
  reform in Baghdad. His poems often decried a different interpretation of Islam and
  a personal and internalized search for Allah. He is most famously known for stating
  “I am the Truth,” the Truth being one of the Ninety-Nine Names of Allah. As a controversial
  figure with radical views, he was imprisoned for nine years in Baghdad until he
  was executed by the Abbasid court. His poems are widely known and many are sung
  on Iraqi maqam today, a particular musical scale. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ve_6m9L-Nk&app=desktop">Here</a>
  is a version of this poem sung on Maqam Nahawand.</p>
