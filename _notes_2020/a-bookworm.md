note: |-
  <p>As a translator and a learned polyglot, Paul Celan’s boggling German title, “Ein Leseast,” combines two unlikely words: <em>Lese</em> + <em>Ast</em>. <em>Lese-</em>: related to reading. <em>Leser</em>: reader. <em>Lesen</em>: to read. <em>Lese</em>: selection; grape harvest. <em>Ast</em>: a branch, a bough; a branch of nerves in the brain. Together, these resonances evoke the way a text branches, grows into your mental space, although in English this portmanteau appears ungainly: “a reading-branch,” or “a reading-bough.” To pun on the idea of a <em>Leseast</em>, of consuming a poet who eats into you, I retitled this: “A bookworm.”</p>

  <p>For those approaching his deep psychological pain, Celan makes an astonishing confession. In 1967, he attempted suicide, stabbing his lung with a letter opener, narrowly missing his heart. His wound is a thick, three-worded <em>Blutklumpenort</em>, a “bloodclumpsite.” Yet, transforming German into English is a healing process: those words need not remain coagulated to keep their meaning. They separate — “blood-clump site” — in the same way a large, healing scab breaks into smaller pieces over time.</p>

  <p>Other important references are technical and autobiographical. To explore what one’s eyes truly “see” as one reads, Celan couples the motifs of <em>space travel</em> and <em>eye</em>. As the socket of the eye is an “orbit,” the reader’s eyes are where the cosmic journey occurs. Our irises, their pocks and craters under the cornea, become the basalt surface of the moon. To dwell in the act of reading, that mental in-between space, is to colonize it. But like programmed rovers, one’s attentiveness can become rote. A metaphor for the Holocaust is concealed here: the moon’s silent, ashen surface is the dwelling for a people whose bodies were turned to ash. As their diaspora did not jettison them beyond Earth’s gravity, they inhabit not the earth (T, Terrestrial), but are still earthly (t, terrestrial). Leaving this sterile lunar environment, Celan voyages inward, finding his people not by reading but through the act of writing, inspired by a postcard sent by the operator of a now silenced political radio station.</p>

  <p>But he must cross through death. The adverb <em>hinüber</em> (“over across”) is an idiom for both “to pass away” and “beyond repair.” Celan parts <em>hin</em> and <em>über</em>, joining them with <em>Jahr</em> (“year”), for <em>jahrhin</em> and <em>jahrüber</em>, to suggest the torturous duration that such crossing takes. I pair “year” with “shutdown.”</p>
abio: "<p>Paul Celan made it his lifelong task to bear witness to the unspeakable.
  He desperately sought a new poetic vocabulary uncontaminated by Nazi appropriation.
  In his quest to confront the tainted spirit of the German language after the Second
  World War, his voracious reading habits spanned virtually every discipline. Born
  Paul Antschel in Romania to Jewish parents, both of his parents were murdered during
  the Holocaust. Reinventing himself as Paul Celan in May 1947 through a play on the
  syllables of his family name (Antschel … Ancel … Celan), he launched to international
  fame with the memorial poem, “Todesfuge” (“Death Fugue”). He also gained renown
  as a German translator of Emily Dickinson, Osip Mandelstam, Shakespeare, and nearly
  two dozen other authors from over six languages. After suffering unfounded accusations
  of plagiarism, he distanced himself from his previous poetic achievements, refining
  a radically abstract new form of poetry in his final years. Chosen from the posthumously
  published volume <em>Schneepart</em> (1971), the poem “Ein Leseast” features a neologism
  about <em>the act of reading</em>. As it has no direct correlate in English, my
  translation puns on the German title: “A bookworm.”</p>"
tbio: "<p>David F. Ting recently completed his pre-medical post-bacc program at the
  University of Pennsylvania. He is currently working as a medical scribe and applying
  to medical school. In his free time, David enjoys cooking, playing the piano, and
  doing pullups. His languages are Chinese, German, and Spanish. This translation
  is a part of his genre-spanning bio-critical fiction on the later poetry of Paul
  Celan, entitled <em>Antschel … Ancel … Celan. Five Acts</em>. David also posts his
  cinema musings on Letterboxd, where you can find him under the name <em>Lichtzwang</em>.</p>"
