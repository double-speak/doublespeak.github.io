poem: "הֱיוּ שָׁלוֹם, תּוֹדָה \nכִּי בָּאתֶם. מַה \nחַיֵּי אָדָם לְבַדָּם \nעִם לִבּוֹ
  הָרַע \nעִם לִבּוֹ הַמַּךְ, עִם עֵינָיו הַסְּתוּרוֹת \nנְשׂוֹחֵחַ קִמְעָה, נִחְיֶה
  \nכְּמוֹ בָּאַגָּדָה, נַחֲלִיף \nמִלִּים סְפוּרוֹת, נֹאמַר \nשָׁלוֹם, שָׁלוֹם \n.הַמַּיִם
  הַפּוֹרְחִים. הַלֶּחֶם הַשָּׁלֵם \nכֵּן. הָיִיתִי. כָּאן. כֻּלָּנוּ. כֵּן \n.תּוֹדָה\n\n<h2>...לְפָנֶיךָ
  הַגֶּשֶׁם הָעַתִּיק</h2>\n \nלְפָנֶיךָ הַגֶּשֶׁם הָעַתִּיק\nהַחֹם בְּגַבְּךָ, אַתָּה
  עוֹמֵד וְחוֹשֵׁב\nמַה מְעַטוֹת הַמִּלִּים\nשֶׁאָדָם צָרִיךְ בְּחַיָּיו\nוְחוֹשֵׁב
  עַל מִי שֶׁרוֹאֶה כָּל אֵלֶּה וְעַל מִי\nשֶׁפָּנָיו רוּחַ, וּבַשַּׁלֶּכֶת, וְגֶשֶׁם\n.זֶה
  הַמַּכֶּה בַּחַלּוֹן\n"
transpoem: "Be well, thanks\nfor coming. What\nare people on their own\nwith their
  evil hearts,\nwith their spent hearts, with their sidelong glances.\nLet’s talk
  a bit and live\nlike in a story, exchange\na few words; we’ll say, \nhey, hello\nblooming
  water, hey, a whole loaf of bread.\nYes. I was. Here. We all were. Yes,\nthanks.\n\n<h2>In
  front of you is this ancient rain…</h2>\r\n\r\nIn front of you is this ancient rain,\r\nbehind
  you, this warmth; you stand and think \r\nhow few are those words\r\npeople need
  in their lives\r\nyou think about the one who sees all this and about the one\r\nwhose
  face is wind, and falling leaves, \r\n                                and pattering
  on the window,\r\nthis rain. "

  <p><b>Be well, thanks:</b></p>
  <p>I found this poem can be read either with a bite of sarcasm or with sincerity. If we take the latter approach, this poem is about genuinely putting in effort to “exchange a few words” even if it’s a little forced at first and follows a script, “like in a story.” It is about valuing those exchanges, even if they’re mundane, like “hey, the water’s growing things in it” or “look, we have enough bread.” There is an acceptance of loneliness too. “We all were” here, in this lonely place, where we craved a few words from another human being. If instead, we read the poem with the former, there is a hint of bitterness, which can be felt in the staccato of the periods in “Yes. I was. Here. We all were.” The narrator is stuck in this ridiculous situation of small-talk, in which roles have to be assumed and conversations playacted, “like in a story.” The “Yes, thanks,” is not the sincere gratitude of the lonely, but the acerbic retort of someone who finds these minute exchanges unsatisfactory and not real enough.</p>
  <p>Although the words in this poem are simple, there were a few translation difficulties. One was the problem of the pronoun. The original poem is in the singular third person, reading “what is a person / with his evil heart....” I chose to use plural to avoid having to use the masculine pronoun, even though I feel something is lost when the singular is not emphasized: the feeling of loneliness is dispelled and instead there is a generalization about a “they.” The emphasis is more on a shared experience of loneliness than loneliness itself. This is a particular example of when translating with an intention (attempting to avoid a gendered pronoun), even if that intention is well-meaning, creates a new, although perhaps not quite as insidious, complication.</p>
  <p><b>In front of you is this ancient rain:</b></p>
  <p>The loneliness in this poem is muted by the comforting ache of memory: a person is standing alone by a window inside, being warmed by a source of heat inside, and his mind gives way to thoughts of others. What I found surprising about this poem is the adjective it uses for rain. It describes the way water recycles itself as “ancient,” a term that is also colloquially used for human things: physical structures built by people that fell to ruin, challenges that humans have been dealing with for eons. This adjective, “ancient,” might be the piece that ties the poem together. The cyclical, long-lasting nature of the environmental process leads the muser to think about a longtime human issue in the second part of the poem: how people need just a few words in their lives.</p>
  <p>That phrase actually posed a difficulty in interpretation. Literally it reads “how few are the words / a person needs in his life.” The question is: what is emphasized, “few” or “need”? Is the speaker surprised at how few words are needed, or is the speaker emphasizing that while the words are few, they are much needed? This led to a translation question. Is it “the” words or “those” words? “The” words would be more straightforwardly faithful to the grammar of the poem. But “those” words emphasized the second interpretation — that despite being small in number, those words exist, and they are specific ones, and they are needed. Although I have the sense that the author meant the former, I chose to play with the latter interpretation to see if the poem could contain it while retaining its original meaning and beauty. In addition, I chose to change “the” rain to “this” rain to convey the focus on the rain and highlight its presence in the poem.</p>
abio: "<p>Tuvya Ruebner (1924–2019) was an Israeli poet, translator, and photographer,
  originally from the former Czechoslovakia. He emigrated to Mandate Palestine without
  his parents and siblings, who were murdered in the Holocaust. He lived on a kibbutz
  in Northern Israel, where he worked as a shepherd and a schoolteacher before becoming
  a professor of comparative literature at Haifa University. His notable translations
  include the work of S. Y. Agnon and the poetry of Leah Goldberg. A professor at
  Haifa University suggested that the literary merit of Ruebner’s translations of
  Agnon into German were the reason the latter won the Nobel Prize for literature
  in 1966. Ruebner himself received a number of awards for his poetry and translations,
  including the Israel Prize for poetry in 2008. Reubner’s poetry is thought to be
  daring in the head-on way it addresses themes of modern Jewish history (an example
  of this is the poem “Lishlo’ach Yad” with its memorable phrase “not so, yes, no
  / no more war”). His poetry also expands beyond these themes and converses with
  Western literary culture.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Yehudith Dashevsky graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2019
  with a bachelors in English literature. She is currently living and working in Washington,
  D.C., and enjoys the curiosity about language and exchanges of meaning occasioned
  by the act of translation.</p>"
