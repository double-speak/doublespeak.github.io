poem: "<p><em>Interview conducted by Yuxin (Vivian) Wen and Rhosean Asmah</p></em>\n\n<p><b>DS:</b>
  We’re really excited to have your translations of Yi Sang-hwa’s poems in this issue!
  Can you share with us when you first began translating from Korean into English,
  and specifically, when you began translating Yi Sang-hwa?</p>\n\n<p><b>EY:</b> So
  first of all, Yi Sang-hwa’s name is generally well-known in Korea. If you went through
  the Korean education system, you’d know he was one of the writers fighting for independence
  during the colonial period under Japanese rule. But, most people only know him for
  one poem that he wrote, which roughly translates to “Does Spring Come to These Stolen
  Fields?” It’s a famous long lyric poem.</p>\n<p>When I was thinking of people that
  I could translate, frankly, there was the issue of copyright. So I wanted to first
  start with people whose works were in the public domain. I began focusing on the
  colonial period. I looked up more of Yi Sang-hwa’s works, which was a way of engaging
  with him further and getting to know him more. Because, as you know, as translators
  translating someone else’s work, knowing the context is very important. It’s more
  than just yanking someone’s words into another language, and then just walking away
  with it in order to really have a good translation. Ideally, you need to have some
  kind of spiritual communication with the poet. And I think that comes a lot in the
  form of contextual research. So the translation process was again, a way of getting
  to know the poet better. In the end, I learned a lot about Yi Sang-hwa.</p>\n<p>After
  that, I grew more interested in reading women’s poetry because I was thinking <em>Where
  are the women poets in translation? Were there women poets from the colonial period?</em>
  Those questions were helpful for my personal development as a writer, as a researcher,
  and as a translator.</p> \n\n<p><b>DS:</b> Can you talk more about the experience
  of translating Yi Sang-hwa?</p>\n\n<p><b>EY:</b> It was a long time ago when I was
  translating Yi Sang-hwa. But even then, first and foremost, I thought of myself
  as a poet. It was important for me to strike a balance between being true to what
  the person actually wrote and using more elevated language to make the translations
  stand on their own in the English language. That’s probably what was running through
  my head. I’m not a big fan of embellishing or adding too much to the original text,
  especially for writers whose language and whose works have not been translated much
  before. It is important to produce a more “direct” translation in my opinion. And
  then afterwards, many different versions can speak more. I hate the word “faithful”
  when it comes to translation. It feels so gendered. But for the lack of a better
  word at this moment, I wanted it to be “faithful.” It’s a delicate balance especially
  when you’re translating from a language that is so vastly different from the target
  language. It’s up to you to decide where this person’s work stands in the world,
  in the field of translation and literary studies, in front of the Anglophone audience.</p>\n\n<p><b>DS:</b>
  That’s a great answer and it raised a lot of questions about the politics of language,
  about the connection between the poet and the translator, and specifically, about
  translating a poet and language less known to the English world. Can you share more
  about your process of translating the women poets? What things do you tend to focus
  on or prioritize?</p>\n\n<p><b>EY:</b> Let me first clarify that when I say “direct”
  translation, it still contains choice. I guess my general approach still is to translate
  as “directly” as possible, and then smooth over the sounds through various revisions.
  I try to see if I can replicate the Korean literary device in the English language.
  It’s not always immediately possible when I’m doing a direct translation instead
  of a loose, more emotion-based one. The translation has to come in various drafts:
  it helps to make several versions and then see what was lost and what was gained
  from each version and try to somehow mediate between them. So, you come up with
  a more polished version that retains the inherent strangeness of translation and
  translated language, while still sounding like a poem that stands on its own in
  the translated language. There isn’t really a formula for this. Really, all I can
  say is compare your different drafts. Get creative with certain things as long as
  you can judge that they really deliver a quality that’s important to the poem in
  your assessment.</p>\n<p>For example, in a Korean original, if I think repetition
  is important but somehow it doesn’t sound the same in the English translation, I
  try to see how I can bring up the repeated nature of the language using another
  literary device. Maybe it would be repetition of certain sounds and consonants,
  for example. I think in that way, you can be a little expansive in your strategies,
  as long as it doesn’t dilute something that you think is significant.</p>\n\n<p><b>DS:</b>
  Our next question is a slight shift from the general process of translation to your
  anthology, <em>Against Healing</em>. In the collection, you translated a variety
  of contemporary female poets and writers. Are there any of them you’d like to highlight?</p>\n\n<p><b>EY:</b>
  First of all, personally, I liked those poems. And secondly, I was thinking about
  how so many of these poets perished from the real world and also the literary world,
  and thinking about all the themes of illness and pain in their works as well. Reading
  these poets really prompted me to think about the literary history of Korea and
  how there have been multiple levels of silencing and erasure of women poets. What
  were the institutional conditions that made them turn to poetry, or use poetry as
  a medium to really express this kind of the suffering they were going through? So
  there wasn’t really one person that sticks out to me as more important than the
  others. They and their homes all have different meanings to me. But as a collective,
  they did make me question how Korea and its literary sphere has treated women writers.
  And I think their poems are all sort of mirrors to the situations that they were
  put in.</p>\n<p>I said all of that to mean that when you’re translating someone,
  you’re not just translating the language. You’re really getting involved in knowing
  the paratextual elements that created these poems. You’re getting to know the history.
  You’re getting to know the politics. When you’re doing colonial period poetry, for
  example, you’re thinking about how censorship could have influenced the writing
  of these poems and what’s in between the lines. So in a way, you’re becoming an
  analyst, like a translation is a form of analysis.</p>\n\n<p><b>DS:</b> Yes, translation
  is never only about language. To translate is to think about literature and what
  literature encodes and reveals. Going back to <em>Against Healing</em>, did you
  get to work with any of the living authors and did you get to share your translation
  with any of them?</p>\n\n<p><b>EY:</b> I am in touch with Kim Hyesoon. I’m actually
  cotranslating with my husband. Most recently, I translated a suite of poems that
  she wrote for the Busan Biennale. And I showed her my translations as well. Also,
  because I’m using some of her poems for my dissertation, I reached out to her about
  some interpretative decisions. I wanted to know what intentions she had when she
  wrote them in Korean, even though, of course, authorial intention only goes so far.
  You shouldn’t solely rely on what they meant in your analysis and translation.</p>\n\n<p>Other
  than that, I haven’t really been in touch with the women that I translated. Kim
  Yideum, she’s a poet in <em>Against Healing</em>. We follow each other on social
  media, but we’ve never spoken to each other. [<em>Laughs.</em>]</p>\n\n<p><b>DS:</b>
  In your translator’s note to <em>Against Healing</em>, you mentioned that although
  not all of the women may identify themselves as feminist, in your reading of their
  works, you see them as feminist. Also, the word “feminist” has gained so much resonance
  and baggage over the years. Considering all of this, we were wondering two things.
  How would you describe your relationship with feminism? Do you call yourself a feminist?</p>\n\n<p><b>EY:</b>
  Yeah, well i definitely identify as feminist. I think in order to be a decent human
  being everyone should. But I think in Korea there has been hesitancy about the term
  in the popular imagination because a lot of people do have misconceptions about
  its meaning. That’s not to say that there isn’t any feminist criticism in Korea.
  The word is being used widely. I just think that the general public has to have
  more self-education on what it really means. Because of that, I think women writers
  have been more hesitant in embracing that word to describe themselves. It’s a little
  different now that Me Too and a feminist boom in korea has happened in the past
  few years. Now, I think younger people and writers are more aware of feminist criticism
  and what feminism means.</p>\n<p>However, I also think that we have to dismantle
  our own notions of Western feminism when we look at conversations happening in Korea.
  If we use the West as the standard, or as something to strive toward, then every
  other country <em>not</em> in the West is seen as the same. But, everyone’s timeline
  is different. The issues at hand are different. This isn’t to say that I think it’s
  okay Koreans are not talking about trans rights, for instance, but I think that
  that’s the phase Korean feminism is in right now. It’s incorrect to use the Western
  angle to critique it as being belated or somehow less advanced.</p>\n\n<p><b>DS:</b>
  We agree. That’s an important clarification to make. Going back more directly to
  the subject of translation, we’re also interested in how it relates to liminality.
  How does your experience as a translator mediate your relationships between different
  cultures and places?</p>\n\n<p><b>EY:</b> When I’m thinking about something as a
  bilingual person, there are, of course, things that only exist in Korean or in English.
  Or, when I react to something in Korean then think about how I’d react to it in
  English, I feel like I have different personalities. When I realize these differences,
  I want to exercise them through poetry. So, I might notice that there are a lot
  of onomatopoeias in Korean, and it makes me more sensitive to the sounds that I
  use in my English poetry. Or, maybe there are idioms in English that don’t exist
  in Korean, and then I try to find something with the same meaning. But then the
  imagery is totally different. All of this, I think, sharpens my observational skills,
  which feed into my writing.</p>\n    <p>Even when I’m writing my original poetry,
  I sometimes I feel that I have to translate my culture or do a cultural translation
  of something, or that I just need to translate myself. So then, what does it feel
  like to translate the emotional information? And what can I do with it on the level
  of language? These are all just challenges that you and I have to face as writers
  and translators.</p>\n​\n<p><b>DS:</b> What advice would you offer to young translators
  who are just beginning to translate poems?</p>\n​\n<p><b>EY:</b> I think that it
  is important to have at least one trusted reader of your work. When you’re revising
  and revising and revising, it’s really easy to get lost in your own thoughts. You’re
  so close to the work that you can’t really see it. So, you need someone who will
  look at it from a distance and be genuine with you about what’s working and what’s
  not. I have one friend that I send all my drafts to, and I know they’re going to
  be honest. I know they’re going to help me with edits or make suggestions. Even
  if I don’t take any, it still helps me think. For example, say my friend told me
  to change something, but I find I don’t want to. Maybe it means that the line is
  really important to me, that it’s somehow key to the emotional chord of the poem,
  but that it’s not coming across in the right way. So, perhaps I need to revisit
  the line and do something different around it. This applies for translation, too.
  Maybe you have a friend who speaks the same languages you do. And maybe they can
  tell you if you stray too far from what the author said or that the translation
  is not lyrical enough, all of those things. So, really, just try to keep that community
  of the two people going. That takes work, though — I don’t take that friend for
  granted.</p>\n​\n<p><b>DS:</b> We’d like to end the interview by addressing the
  situation we’re all in now. Specifically, this interview is taking place virtually
  because we are in the midst of a pandemic and self-isolating in our respective locations.
  Could you speak about this experience and whether you have witnessed or felt questions
  of translation because of this sense of isolation?</p>\n​\n<p><b>EY:</b> It’s interesting
  because for people in the literary world, our careers are often described as solitary
  or lonely. But, translation is inherently a conversation with somebody else, who
  might be in conversation with somebody else. There is a whole community contained
  in the process of translation. So, I feel that translation is an ultimately <em>un</em>-lonely
  enterprise.</p>\n    <p>I’ve translated a bit during quarantine, and sometimes I
  just had to say <em>Kim Hyesoon, what are you talking about?</em> I looked up her
  words, and her other words, and really tried to get in her mind. I didn’t feel alone
  at all. In a way, it actually felt like I had too many engagements in my head at
  that moment. Of course, I understand when people say that writing or reading is
  kind of an isolating practice. But I never feel that way because I’ve always seen
  both practices as being a very rigorous communication with and analysis of other
  people who came before you, who wrote this before you could even imagine it.</p>"
