  一首诗有时不是一首诗。它是一座山。
  你得用尽全力才能
  达到峰顶。透过云雾，也许
  什么也看不见。

  一首诗有时不是一首诗。它是一条河。
  仿佛是在忘川，你让小船在逆流而上。
  或躺在船上，望着天上的云朵
  任随波涛把你带到哪里。

  一首诗有时不是一首诗。它是一片原野。
  长满荒草， 或到处布满瓦砾
  你在远古的废墟上
  盖起你的小房子。

  一首诗有时不是一首诗。它是一块石头。
  它击中了你，正像你当时用来
  击中别人。现在一切变得安静了。
  你在上面雕刻出人形。

  <span lang="zh"><h2>纳博科夫的蝴蝶</h2></span>

  纳博科夫喜爱蝴蝶。他捕捉
  并杀死它们。他把它们做成标本
  钉在纸板上。这是否在告诉我们
  爱是一件残忍的事情？早餐过后
  我清洗着碗筷。大海在远处发蓝。
  它沉默。我听不见它的声音。也许太远了。
  我听到的只是自来水管发出的哗哗声。
  我喜爱海。但我无法捕捉
  并杀死它。我无法把它做成标本
  钉在纸板上。爱有不同的方式。
  美也是这样。大海在远处。发蓝
  并沉默。我知道他仍然活着。
  它沉默着。但我知道它愤怒时的样子。

transpoem: "Sometimes a poem is not a poem. It is a mountain.\nYou have to exhaust
  all your power to\nreach its peak. Through the cloud, perhaps\nyou cannot see anything.\n\nSometimes
  a poem is not a poem. It is a river.\nAs if you were in Wangchuan, you would let
  the boat go upstream\nor lie flat on the boat, looking at the clouds in the sky
  and\nallowing waves to bring you nowhere.\n\nSometimes a poem is not a poem. It
  is a prairie.\nFull of weeds, or covered with shards and tiles everywhere.\nYou
  are on archaic relics\nbuilding your own little house. \n\nSometimes a poem is not
  a poem. It is a rock.\nIt hits you, just as you used it in the past to\nhit others.
  Now everything turns to stillness.\nYou carve a human figure into it.\n\n<h2>Nabakov’s
  Butterfly</h2>\n\nNabokov loves butterflies. He captured\nand killed them. He made
  them into specimens and\nnailed them on cardboard. Is this telling us \nlove is
  a cruel thing? After breakfast\nI am cleaning the dishes. The sea is shining blue
  in the distance.\nIt is in silence. I can't hear the sound of it. Maybe too far
  away.\nAll I hear is the huahua sound from the water pipes.\nI love the sea. But
  I can't capture\nand kill it. I can't make it into a specimen and\nnail it on cardboard.
  Love has different ways.\nThe same is true in aesthetics. The sea is in the distance.
  Blue\nand in silence. I know that it is still alive.\nIt is in silence. But I know
  how it looks when it is in wrath.\n \n"
note: "<p>It seems that every poet at least once writes about poetry and poetics in
  a poem, if not several. Shuguang Zhang’s 《一首诗》(“A Poem”) in particular strikes me,
  since at the beginning of each stanza, it negates itself by saying “a poem is not
  a poem.” However, after reading the poem, I think that it defines what a poem is
  precisely and accurately. 一首诗, by negation, actually values and emphasizes the ambiguity
  and multiplicity of meanings within a poem, as well as indicates the importance
  of readers in the reading of a poem. Zhang’s imagery reminds me of T. S. Eliot’s
  <em>Wasteland</em> which presents images of “rubble,” a “wasteland,” and “rock[s]”
  Meanwhile, 《一首诗》also contains many traditional Chinese poetic features, with images
  commonly found in Tang Dynasty poetry, such as “boat[s],” “mountain[s],” “cloud[s],”
  and the legendary “Wangchuan.” When translating this poem, I tried to make my English
  translation align closely with the original poem. For instance, I used a direct
  translation of Wangchuan River, a mythical river between the living world and the
  dead world, and provided a footnote for context. I also tried to combine my understanding
  of the poem with the meanings present within it. For instance, the direct translation
  of “任凭波涛把你带到哪里” is “allowing waves to bring you anywhere.” My choice of “nowhere”
  rather than “anywhere” here indicates that poetry brings you to a place that is
  remote and beyond your imagination. In the last line “你在上面雕刻出人形,” the word “上面”
  means “on,” yet I translate it as “into” in an effort to imply that the rock actually
  becomes a human instead of just a human figure — just as a poem becomes what it
  is after it is read.</p> <p>I love this poem since it shows different perspectives
  about love, nature and aesthetics. The title includes the name Nabokov, which is
  a reference to Vladimir Nabokov, a famous Russian-American novelist whose work <em>Lolita</em>
  will perhaps come to the reader’s mind. There is a sense of intertextuality in this
  poem. Shuguang Zhang’s 《纳博科夫的蝴蝶》(“Nabokov’s Butterfly”) ponders over the topics
  such as what love is, the relationship between nature and human beings, as well
  as the diversity of aesthetics. We can see Zhang’s masterful writing, in which he
  fuses scenes from everyday life with images of nature and aesthetics. When translating
  this poem, I try to replicate the original’s by using simple and everyday language.
  I keep the Chinese onomatopoeia “哗哗” (<em>huahua</em>), the dynamic sound of running
  water in my English translation. Additionally, I use many prepositional phrases
  such as “in the distance,” “in silence,” and “in wrath” to show a sharp contrast
  between verbal phrases like “capture and kill them” and “nail them on cardboard.”
  With these contrasts, I would like to indicate the disturbing relationship between
  human and nature, killing and silence, nearness and distance.</p>"
abio: "<p>Shuguang Zhang was born in 1956 in Wangkui County, Heilongjiang Province,
  China. He is a poet, translator, and a retired professor of Chinese at the School
  of Literature, Hei Longjiang University. He began to write poetry when he was in
  college, pursuing a solid and tough poetic style in the past. Zhang’s poetry collections
  include <em>The Clown's Gown</em>, <em>The Snowfall in the Afternoon</em>, <em>Zhang
  Shuguang’s Poetry</em>, and <em>Haunted House</em>, among others. His more notable
  collections of translated poetry are <em>Divine Comedy</em> and <em>Czesław Miłosz’s
  Poetry</em>. Zhang has been awarded the first Liu Li’an Poetry Award, the Poetry

  Su Shi Poetry Award. His works have been translated into English, Spanish, German,
  Japanese, Dutch, and other languages. The two poems presented here (“A Poem” and
  “Nabokov’s Butterfly”) are some of Zhang’s new poems, which diverge from his past
  poetic style. Recently, Zhang said that his poetic style has been changed over the
  past two or three years and he has been a close reader of some American and Western
  poets, including John Ashbery and Czesław Miłosz. Additionally, he said that he
  feels kinship with the poetics of Charles Bernstein and other Language poets.</p>"
