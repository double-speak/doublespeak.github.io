poem: |
  بعد از عبور فاصله ها را شناختم‬
  «بی» را شناختم من و «با» را شناختم‬
  ‬
  جغرافیای شهر تو چندان شگفت نیست‬
  این بام این دوگانه هوا را شناختم‬
  ‬
  آخر اگرچه دیر ولی زیرکانه تر‬
  فرق میان ما و شما را شناختم‬
  ‬
  گفتی: «عبث مکوش که یک دست بی صداست»
  من در سکوت نیز صدا را شناختم‬
  ‬
  خود را شناختم من و شادا که عاقبت‬
  این سخت جان آبله پا را شناختم‬
transpoem: "After crossing, I learned what distances are\nI learned “without” and
  “with,” what these words really are\n\nThe geography of your town is not all that
  strange\nI learned about this rooftop and what its two climates are\n\nAt the end,
  though all too late, but all too well\nI learned what the differences between “you”
  and “I” are \n\nYou said “don’t try in vain, a single hand cannot make a sound”\nIn
  silence too, I learned what sounds truly are \n\nI learned all about myself at the
  end, how wonderful!\nI am persistent in death and I know how worn out my feet are\n"

  <p>“Crossing” is a translation of an untitled <em>ghazal</em> in Persian. The <em>ghazal</em> is a poetic form central to many languages and poetic traditions, including, but not limited to, Persian, Urdu, Turkish, and Arabic, since at least the ninth century. The past few decades have seen a surge in English <em>ghazals</em>. The <em>ghazal</em> is defined by two sets of characteristics. First, the form: the “aa-ba-ca” rhyme scheme is the most recognizable formal feature of the <em>ghazal</em>; there are also rules governing meter. Second, the content: the <em>ghazal</em> tradition comes with a cluster of themes, images, devices, and conventions.</p>

  <p>“Crossing” places separation, a typical <em>ghazal</em> theme, in an urban setting. Using a curious combination of contemporary and archaic Persian, it invokes the expected characters of a <em>ghazal</em>, namely the beloved and the lover, through several less-expected juxtapositions, like the “with” and “without” prefixes. It culminates in a moment of self-reflection. Bahmani’s phrasing and style that result in a dense poem, riddled with allusions to elements from the <em>ghazal</em> tradition as well as his playful use of different registers of Persian, are not transportable into English. Nonetheless, this translation has attempted to draw out and highlight dynamic characteristics of the poem — the aforementioned juxtapositions for instance — that do lend themselves to translation into English.</p>
abio: "<p>Mohammad Ali Bahmani (b. 1942) is an Iranian poet and songwriter. Beyond
  that, his biography is irrelevant to this particular translation. It might be worth
  mentioning that Bahmani is known, among other things, as a proponent of the postmodern
  <em>ghazal</em> movement in Persian poetry.</p>"
tbio: '<p>Ali Noori is a doctoral student in religious studies at Penn. He likes <em>ghazals</em>.His
  dissertation is titled "Pious Praise Poetry: Emotions, Piety, and the Making of
  Medieval Islamic Subject."</p>'
