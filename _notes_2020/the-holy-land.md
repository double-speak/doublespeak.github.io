poem: "Ho conosciuto Gerico,\nho avuto anch’io la mia Palestina,\n  le mura del manicomio\nerano
  le mura di Gerico\ne una pozza di acqua infettata \n  ci ha battezzati tutti.\nLì
  dentro eravamo ebrei \n  e i Farisei erano in alto \n  e c’era anche il Messia \n
  \ confuso tra la folla:\nun pazzo che urlava al Cielo \n  tutto il suo amore in
  Dio.\nNoi tutti, branco di asceti \n  eravamo come gli uccelli \n  e ogni tanto
  una rete \n  oscura ci imprigionava\nma andavamo verso le messe, \n  le messe di
  nostro Signore\ne Cristo il Salvatore. \n  Fummo lavati e sepolti, \n  odoravamo
  di incenso.\nE dopo, quando amavamo, \n  ci facevano gli elettrochoc \n  perché,
  dicevano, un pazzo \n  non può amare nessuno.\nMa un giorno da dentro l’avello \n
  \ anch’io mi sono ridestata\ne anch’io come Gesù\nho avuto la mia resurrezione,
  \n  ma non sono salita nei cieli \n  sono discesa all’inferno\nda dove riguardo
  stupita \n  le mura di Gerico antica.\n"
transpoem: "I got to know Jericho, I \n  too had my Palestine, \n  the walls of the
  \n  asylum\nwere the walls of Jericho\nand a puddle of infected water \n  baptized
  all of us.\nWe were Jews there\nand the Pharisees were above us \n  and the Messiah
  was also there, \n  lost in the crowd:\na madman crying to Heaven \n  all his love
  for God.\nAll of us, a pack of ascetics, \n  we were all like birds\nand every now
  and then a \n  dark net would trap us,\nbut we would go towards the masses, \n  the
  masses of our Lord\nand Jesus Christ the Savior. \n  We were washed and buried,
  \n  we smelt like incense.\nAnd then, when we loved, \n  they would electroshock
  us, \n  because, they said, a madman \n  can love no one.\nBut one day from my grave
  \n  I too have awakened,\nand like Jesus\nI too had my own resurrection, \n  but
  I did not rise to heaven\nI went all the way down to hell\nfrom where, astonished,
  I watch again \n  the walls of the ancient Jericho.\n"

  <p>Through the poem “La Terra Santa,” Alda Merini speaks out against the unspeakable abominations of mental institutions. She compares asylums to the Christian Holy Land both are torn apart by suffering, horror, and loneliness. I think the biggest challenge when translating this poem was conveying in English the emotions triggered by the original. Apart from <em>avello</em> (a fancy word for “grave”), the words used in the Italian version are very straightforward, yet particularly evocative. Punctuation is used parsimoniously, making the words of the poem flow almost as if it were a stream of consciousness. I chose to keep my translation like the original, using punctuation only when strictly necessary.</p>
  <p>I found the line where Merini defines herself and the other people at the asylum very interesting. She calls them <em>branco di asceti</em> (literally, “a pack of ascetics”), but compares them to birds. I wonder why Merini chose the word <em>branco</em> instead of <em>stormo</em> (“flock”), which better suits the bird analogy. Nevertheless, I chose to be loyal to the poet, keeping “pack of ascetics” instead of “flock.”</p>
  <p>I love the lines where Merini writes “un pazzo / non può amare nessuno.” These words are <em>so</em> powerful, especially when taking into account the double negation normally used in Italian. Trying to render it literally in the translation process would completely break the rules of English grammar. Therefore, I had to choose between translating the line as “a madman / cannot love anyone” and “a madman / can love no one.” To me, the latter is more evocative than the former: it’s firm and sharp, and gives a clear-cut nuance to the idea conveyed by the poet.</p>
  <p>“La Terra Santa” is a poem about those who have been forgotten, as well as the physical and psychological pain they suffered in psychiatric hospitals. As Merini writes, even after her resurrection, she still bears the marks of all the evil she experienced.</p>

  <p>Alda Merini is one of the most appreciated female Italian poets of the twentieth century. She experienced the horrors of World War II in fleeing Milan, her hometown, to seek shelter in the countryside. She wrote that during the bombings she would hide in paddy fields because bombs would not explode in the water. However, WWII was not the worst she had to face in life. Her existence was torn apart by her mental illness — or more specifically, by the way mental illness was perceived during her time. In 1965, at the age of thirty-four, she was committed to a psychiatric hospital for the first time.</p>
  <p>She drifted in and out of such asylums for the next fourteen years. A mother, she was taken away from her four daughters.While institutionalized, she experienced unspeakable tortures, of which she started writing after she finally returned home in 1979. Alda Merini is also remembered for writing aphorisms, and when I think of her, I always envision her smoking cigarettes — something she never gave up, even during her last days.</p>
tbio: "<p>Carla Rossi graduated with a degree in conference interpreting from the
  University of Bologna in Italy in 2017 after spending a semester at the University
  of Pennsylvania as an exchange student. She is still trying to find her place in
  the world. The only thing she knows is that she wants to keep learning English and
  possibly work in it. That’s why she recently completed her CELTA course, which enables
  her to teach English worldwide.</p>"
