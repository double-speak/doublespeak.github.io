title: Galeria LXII
transtitle: Translation of “Galeria LXII”
author: Antonio Machado
translator: Anika Prakash
poem: "Desgarrada la nube; el arco iris \nbrillando ya en el cielo,\ny en un fanal
  de lluvia\ny sol en el campo envuelto.\n\nDesperté. ¿Quién enturbia\nlos mágicos
  cristales de mi sueño?\nMi corazón latía \natónito y disperso.\n\n…¡El limonar florido,
  \nel cipresal del huerto,\nel prado verde, el sol, el agua, el \niris…, el agua
  en tus cabellos!…\n\nY todo en la memoria se perdía como \nuna pompa de jabón al
  viento.\n\n<h2>Varia XCIV</h2>\n\nEn medio de la plaza y sobre tosca piedra, \nel
  agua brota y brota. En el cercano \nhuerto eleva, tras el muro ceñido por la \nhiedra,
  alto ciprés la mancha de su ramaje yerto.\r\n\r\nLa tarde está cayendo frente a
  los caserones\r\nde la ancha plaza, en sueños. Relucen las \nvidrieras con ecos
  mortecinos de sol. En los balcones\r\nhay formas que parecen confusas calaveras.\r\n\r\nLa
  calma es infinita en la desierta plaza, \ndonde pasea el alma su traza de alma en
  \npena. El agua brota y brota en la marmórea taza.\r\nEn todo el aire en sombra
  no más que el agua suena.\r\n\n"
transpoem: "The clouds are torn, the rainbow is already shining \nin the sky: the
  rain quiets\nand sunlight wraps the field.\n\nI woke up. Who disturbed the magic
  crystals\nof my dreams? My heart pounded\nand then scattered.\n\nThe flowering lemon
  tree, \nthe cypress in the orchard,\nthe green meadow, the sun, the water, the iris!
  \nThe droplets in your hair!\n\nSuddenly, everything in my memory dissipated \nlike
  a soap bubble in the wind.\n\n<h2>Varia XCIV</h2>\n\nIn the middle of the square,
  atop rough stone,\nthe water gushes and spouts. In the nearby orchard \nbehind the
  ivy-covered wall, the stiff branches\nof the cypress rise high.\n\nAfternoon settles
  on the wide square like a dream. \nThe stained-glass windows gleam with dull echoes
  \nof the sun. On the balconies, there are shadows \nthat look like distorted skulls.\n\nAn
  infinite peace consumes the deserted square, \nwhere the soul wanders and traces
  its pain.\nThe water gushes and spouts into a marble bowl; \nthe air darkens no
  more than the water sings.\n\n\n\n\n"
note: "<p>Antonio Machado’s poetry is rich with imagery, and not all of it is properly
  expressed through direct translations of each word. For example, in “Varia XCIV,”
  the phrase <em>confusas calaveras</em> translates literally to “confused skulls,”
  but I felt as though the image of shadowed heads would be better represented by
  the phrase “distorted skulls.” In other places, I focused on simplifying the meaning
  by eliminating extra words; for example, in the same poem, the line “dónde pasea
  el alma su traza de alma en pena” directly translates to something like “where the
  soul walks, the soul traces its pain,” but I translated it as “where the soul wanders
  and traces its pain” for the sake of simplicity. Additionally, in the final poem,
  I chose to italicize the dialogue instead of putting it in quotation marks and to
  separate the last line from the rest of the poem to heighten the strength of its
  emotion and its impact.</p>"
abio: "<p>Antonio Machado (1875–1939) was a Spanish poet who was part of the literary
  movement known as the Generation of ’98. He wrote both Modernist and Romantic poetry,
  but the vast majority of his work derived from similar themes. His poetry was very
  well received and over the course of his lifetime, he published several books of
  poetry, the most notable ones being <em>Soledades</em>, <em>Soledades. Galerias.
  Otras poemas.</em>, and <em>Nuevas Canciones</em>. Each of these books primarily
  consists of poems that are numbered instead of titled.</p>"
