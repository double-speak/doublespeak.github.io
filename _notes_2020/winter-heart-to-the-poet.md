poem: "물장수가 귓속으로 들어와 내 눈을 열었다.\n보아라!\n까치가 뼈만 남은 나뭇가지에서 울음을 운다.\n왜 이래?\n서리가 덩달아 추녀끝으로
  눈물을 흘리는가.\n내야 반가웁기만 하다. 오늘은 따스하겠구나.\n\n<span lang=\"ko\"><h2>시인에게</h2></span>\r\n\n\r\n한
  편의 시 그것으로\r\n새로운 세계 하나를 낳아야 할 줄 깨칠 그 때라야\r\n시인아, 너의 존재가\r\n비로소 우주에게 없지 못할 너로 알려질것이다,\r\n가뭄
  든 논에게는 청개구리의 울음이 있어야 하듯.\r\n\r\n새 세계란 속에서도\r\n마음과 몸이 갈려 사는 줄 풍류만 나와 보아라.\r\n시인아,
  너의 목숨은\r\n진저리나는 절룸발이 노릇을 아직도 하는 것이다.\r\n언제든지 일식된 해가 돋으면 뭣하며 진들 어떠랴\r\n시인아, 너의 영광은\r\n미친
  개 꼬리도 밟는 어린해의 짬 없는 그 마음이 되어\r\n밤이라도 낮이라도\r\n새 세계를 낳으려 손댄 자국이 시가 될 때에 있다.\r\n촛불로
  날아들어 죽어도 아름다운 나비를 보아라.\r\n\r\n(1926)"
transpoem: "The water-seller came through my ears and opened my eyes.\nLook!\nThe
  magpie cries on the branch down to its bone.\nWhy?\nThe frost follows suit and drops
  tears through the eaves’ corners.\nOf course I welcome this. It shall be warm today.\n\n<h2>To
  the Poet</h2>\n\nOnly in that moment when you realize you must give birth \nto a
  new world with that one poem,\nPoet, your existence will be known \nas one the universe
  cannot be without,\nlike how rice paddies in drought need the cry of the green frog.\n\nEven
  in the new world \nOnly see the elegance of art, the line dividing mind and body.\nPoet,
  your life means\nyou still live as one with that sickening limp. \nWhat is there
  to do when the eclipsed sun rises, and when it sinks?\nPoet, your glory exists in\nthe
  small heart of the child who dares step on the tail of a mad dog,\nin that moment
  when stains from the hand\ntrying night or day to give birth to a new world\nbecome
  a poem. \nLook at the butterfly, \nbeautiful even when it dies flying into the candlelight.\n\n(1926)\n"
note: "<p>I translated these poems a few years ago, in an attempt to “get to know”
  Yi, and thereby the literary atmosphere of the colonial period, better. I was initially
  attracted to the lyricism of his most famous poem, “Ppaeatkin Tŭredo Pomŭn Onŭn’ga”
  (1926; trans. “Does Spring Come Even to Stolen Fields?”), and wanted to read more
  of his work. Translating these poems and spending time with the language helped
  me ask further and more engaged questions about certain imagery and diction, knowing
  the historical context in which the poems were produced.</p>"

  <p>Yi Sang-hwa (<span lang="ko">이상화</span>,1901–1943) was a colonial-era poet. His work is known for its proletarian and resistance spirit, despite censorship and pressure from the Japanese authorities.</p>

  <p>His involvement in the liberation movement began when he was just a teenager. In 1919 in Daegu, the city of his birth, he and his friends started organizing a student uprising as part of the March First Independence Movement. It ultimately failed when the police found out their plans ,and Yi had to go into hiding for some time.</p>

  <p>His literary debut was a few years later in 1922, when his first poetry publications appeared in <em>Paekcho</em>, a short-lived literary magazine known for publishing romanticist poetry with themes of despair, desperation, and death. In 1925, he became one of the first members of the arts organization KAPF (Korea Artista Proletara Federatio), which, as the name suggests, promoted proletarian ideals.</p>

  <p>In 1937, he went to China for three months to visit his brother Yi Sang-chŏng, an independence fighter, and was arrested by the Japanese police upon return. He was released after eight months.</p>

  <p>Afterward, he worked as a teacher as well as an amateur boxer. He quit in 1940 to focus on reading and research. He translated a classic novel <em>The Tale of Chunhyang</em> into English, and began working on other French translation projects, but died before finishing them; he passed away in Daegu, in 1943, after suffering from stomach cancer.</p>
