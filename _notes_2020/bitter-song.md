pid: bitter-song
title: Canción Amarga
transtitle: Bitter Song
author: Julia de Burgos
translator: Heta Patel
poem: "Nada turba mi ser, pero estoy triste. \nAlgo lento de sombra me golpea, \naunque
  casi detrás de esta agonía, \nhe tenido en mi mano las estrellas. \n\nDebe ser la
  caricia de lo inútil, \nla tristeza sin fin de ser poeta, \nde cantar y cantar,
  sin que se rompa \nla tragedia sin par de la existencia. \n\nSer y no querer ser?
  esa es la divisa, \nla batalla que agota toda espera, \nencontrarse, ya el alma
  moribunda, \nque en el mísero cuerpo aún quedan fuerzas. \n\n¡Perdóname, oh amor,
  si no te nombro! \nFuera de tu canción soy ala seca. \nLa muerte y yo dormimos juntamente?
  \nCantarte a ti, tan sólo, me despierta.\n"
transpoem: "Nothing disturbs my soul, yet I am sad. \nSomething slow and dark strikes
  me, \nalthough just behind this agony, \nI have held the stars in my hands. \n\nIt
  must be the futility of touch, \nthe infinite sadness of a poet’s being, \nof singing
  and singing without breaking\nthe unconquered tragedy of existence. \n\nTo be and
  to not want to be…is the war cry, \nthe battle that squanders all hope, \nto discover
  that in the already dying soul, \nthe miserable body still has strength. \n\nForgive
  me, oh love, if I do not call for you! \nFor without your song, I would be a dry
  wing. \nDeath and I sleep together…\nBut only in singing to you do I awake. \n"

  <p>At its heart, “Canción Amarga” (“Bitter Song”) explores the pain of existence, the strength and frailty of the human soul, and the hope one can find in others. It is a poem of feeling, emotions that for me surmised to the notion that life is an unending battle. This realization contextualized the rest of my translation process. For example, the line “la tragedia sin par de la existencia” directly translates to “the unparalleled tragedy of existence.” However, the poet’s voice seems to be frustrated with her inability to succeed in this war of life. It is for this reason that I ultimately decided to translate the phrase to “the unconquered tragedy of existence.” Once again, <em>divisa</em> means motto, yet at the same time the conflict between living and dying (to be or to not want to be) is the same call that prompts the battle — it’s the “war cry.”</p>

  <p>Given the simple diction, the poem was fairly easy to translate. At the same time, certain phrases proved more difficult to transmit in all of their emotional intensity. The line “debe ser la caricia de lo inútil” means “it must be the caress of the useless.” But, what if touch itself is useless? Although the useless are personified here, the line seems to remark on the “futility of touch” itself. The inherent nature of this sadness is exemplified in the next line where instead of translating <em>ser poeta</em> to “being a poet,” I chose “a poet’s being.” These decisions were made with the hope of exemplifying the deep, raw, and subtle emotional versatility Julia de Burgos employs in this poem, a beautiful reminder of the fact that despite the pain, we still have the strength and someone to call on for hope.</p>
abio: "<p>Julia de Burgos (1914–1953) was a Puerto Rican poet, journalist, and civil
  rights activist for women and African and Afro-Caribbean writers. She played a crucial
  role in the Puerto Rican independence movement and like many politically driven
  writers, imbued her literary works with politics and her political work with literature.
  In addition to authoring several poetry collections, she served as the Secretary
  General of the Daughters of Freedom — the women’s branch of the Puerto Rican Nationalist
  Party. Some of her most notable works include <em>Poema para Mi Muerte</em>, <em>Yo
  Misma Fui Mi Ruta</em>, and <em>Alta Mar y Goviota</em>, poems that lyrically married
  the beauty and the struggle of the oppressed. It was her focus on the marginalized
  that particularly distinguished her, catching the eye of Pablo Neruda during his
  time in Cuba. Her engagement with themes of sexism and social justice in her writing
  paved the way for many feminist writers to come. To this day, Julia de Burgos’ work
  still resonates with many and she continues to live through the various cultural
  centers, schools, and parks named after her.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Heta Patel is a junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying health
  and societies and Hispanic studies. Language, for her, is an extension of her interest
  in understanding people, the way they think, and the way their bodies interact with
  the world. Although this interest has largely manifested itself in her pursuing
  medicine, immersing herself in Spanish, and trying to pursue global health endeavors
  in Latin America, she has also found writing poetry and its translation instrumental
  in her desire to learn more about the human condition. In her free time, she enjoys
  curating her Spotify playlists and bullet journaling.</p>"
