People, young and old, in Lebanon – he lived in Beirut for a while – and in Syria, his home country, all know the familiar tunes which have popularized his work.

THEY SEPARATED… ","<p>When translating Hikmet’s “Story of a Separation,” one of the things I had to work around was the fragmentation of Hikmet’s language. In a sense, the visual poetry he creates is reminiscent of William Carlos Williams, in that it guides the reader into a specific way of reading. It was very important to me to keep his method of writing and figure out a way to make it cohere in English; his lack of punctuation creates a difficulty, as it’s not as possible in English to establish Hikmet’s poetic method while also remaining coherent. In the spaces that we would expect punctuation, Hikmet disregards grammatical conventions and moves according to sound. I hope I was able to pass on his intention and the subtle changes in tone without moving too far away from the original.</p>","<p>Nâzım Hikmet (1902–1963) was a Turkish poet, playwright, and revolutionary figure. He is considered Turkey’s first modern poet and was influenced by the Russian Futurist movement. Hikmet was jailed in Turkey for long periods of time for writing what the government claimed was revolutionary poetry. In 1950, Hikmet started a hunger strike protesting the Turkish government’s failure to include an amnesty law in its agenda. Later that year, Hikmet received the International Peace Prize. After his final release from prison, Hikmet moved to the Soviet Union. He continues to be revered by Turkish youth as the voice of revolution.</p>","<p>Keyla Cavdar is a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying English and fine arts. She was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey, and moved to Philadelphia in 2014. She was reintroduced to revolutionary Turkish poet Nâzım Hikmet in a translation class last spring, and his work made it possible for her to understand not only the current political climate in Turkey, but also the implications of losing one’s country and language. Translation enabled her to dwell in the space between her mother tongue, Turkish, and her second language, English.</p>",Turkish,tr,{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/images_17/hikmet.JPG,,photo by a <i>DoubleSpeak</i> staffer,,,,2017,submission

de menos.</em>


La primavera no quiere
que los amores de invierno terminen,

                              pero el verano ha llegado

                              y ha arrasado con todo.

Ahora tú solo sabes hablar del sol,
te haces un moño despeinado mientras bostezas,
te pintas las uñas de los pies,
te ríes mucho más que antes,
y, mientras,
me dejas de querer.

Ahora yo me vuelvo a refugiar en los poemas
y escribo sobre febrero,
echo de menos la lluvia
y el sabor de tu jersey,

                                                  y, mientras,

and in the cold you would teach me how to fly 
and I would miss you.
Then I’d wake up. 
and keep
missing you.</em>

Spring doesn’t want
wintertime loving to end

but summer has arrived

and it’s swept everything away.

Now you only know how to talk about the sun,
you make a messy bun while you yawn,
you paint your toes,
you laugh much more than before,
and, meanwhile,
you stop loving me.

Now I return to the refuge of poems. I seek their shelter 
and write about February,
I miss the rain
and the taste of your sweatshirt, 

                                                                and, meanwhile,

The imperfect tense in Spanish evokes a timelessness that the imperfect in English doesn’t quite do. In my translation, I strove to preserve the juxtaposition of the unbounded time in the italics and the immediacy of the text in standard type.</p>","<p>Elvira Sastre, herself a translator, has been praised for bringing renewed life to the Spanish language and its poetry. “Hiberno” is from her second book of poetry, <em>Baluarte</em>, which was published when she was twenty-two.

I could not bring life to the deserts
At the start of a new day
Some earthquake later
Some city daydream
Remains – a fire in my heart.
Take me into your black eyes.
I don’t belong here.
 
Since you sent pink kites
Addicted violets yellowed
In the dusty cage of fall
I catch the love cranes
Cranes go; I stay.
I am a wanderer; I am at peace; I am tired.
I do not know why I’m in love with you.
On the benches of the Erzurum station
Darkness doesn’t bring sleep
Chasing my lost dreams.
Shadows go; I stay.
 
If the land smells in a thousand ways,
Take me into your black eyes.
I will tear away from the bosom of spring
My heart covered in silk
Sending you the prince’s roses
Hopes stay; I go.
 
The questioners on the sea
Lighthouses, captains, the passing steed
Captured by a flood of fear
Take me into your black eyes.
Brave souls from the sun’s land
Shall found a country like none other
The executioner shall cut the neck of separation.
 
Gently I wait.
This rebellious thorn
This crazy desire drives me to
The brink of the valleys of my soul
Like leaves from a tree
I’m falling
Collect the wounded swallows or
End this unfaithful song
Like a prisoner marching to freedom
Take me into your black eyes.","<p>The first thing to know about Turkish poetry is that is meant to be spoken. That is important because of the many things not visible in print due to line breaks or punctuation, like emotion and emphases. The emotions of this poem, with the complement of music and tempo, set the base for my interpretation of this poem. With my rudimentary Turkish I am thankful for knowing Turkish pronunciation and basic sentence structure, which is essential to being sensitive to the internal rhymes and rhythm. I also translated this poem into my mother tongue, Mandarin, to see if I could gain more insight as well. For example, “biraz şehir hülyası” translated into <span lang=""zh"">小镇遐想</span>, which literally translates to “small town reverie,” I chose to translate as “some city daydream” instead for the repetition of “some,” as intended in Turkish. Verbs end very similarly in Turkish, resulting in a lot more opportunity for rhyme and gravitas in the original, which I tried to replicate by playing with word length. In this poem, there are also literary choices, like the dual meaning of “remains” in the aftermath of an earthquake, that are my own but are inserted in place of my failure to retain the double meanings in other stanzas. Special thanks to Deniz Uğur Kemahlı for his advice.</p>","<p>Nurullah Genç (1960–) is not a career poet. He represents those of us with day jobs who find time to connect with the written word for pleasure. He is currently a faculty member at Istanbul Commerce University teaching Business Management and Organization.

silence,МЪЛЧАНИЕ,Silence,Dora Gabe,Irena Natcheva,"Не помня думите ти — помня твоето мълчание и стаята, запълнена
със наши мисли.

Не помня образа ти — губят се чертите
в паметта ми,
но помня как усещах, че си тук,
в широкото кресло, зад теб прозореца,
веригата на Стара планина, високото небе
и облаче, което плува…

Ти пръв попита:
Що мълчиш?
Отвърнах ти:
Аз не мълча!
Погледна ме, усмихна се и заревото от стъклата
обля лицата ни със светлина! Мълчание.
Препълнено мълчание
с любов и нежност и доверие!

Да бяхме цял живот един до друг мълчали заедно,
не биха думите посмяли да ни разделят…","I do not recall your words — I remember your silence and this room, filled
with our thoughts.

I do not recall your image —
your lines are lost inside my memory,
but I remember how I felt that you were here
in the big armchair
with the window behind you, the ridges of the mountain, the tall sky,
and the single cloud, swimming.

You were first to ask:
Why are you silent?
And I replied:
I am not silent.
You looked at me, you smiled, and the glow of sun through glass bathed our faces in light.
Silence.
Overflowing silence
with love and tenderness and trust!

If we had spent this life together
in silence
words could not have dared to tear us apart.","<p>This poem is deceivingly simple. The gravity of the sadness embedded within is difficult to express. This is in part because Bulgarian has a particularly rich vocabulary for denoting silence. In the last stanza, Gabe uses a direct verb signifying an explicit volition of being silent. Translating this into English seemed like an insurmountable challenge. Gabe further refers to a specific mountain, Stara Planina. I decided not to name this, because it would not carry the same situational meaning for an English reader as it would for a native reader. Another challenge in this text was translating the word <em>заревото</em>, which is a word borrowed from Macedonian that means “glow” or “light,” but has now come to shape the Bulgarian word for fireworks, <em>>заря</em>.</p>
","<p>Dora Gabe (Дора Габе) was one of the most celebrated female Bulgarian poets. She published poetry for adults and children, as well as travel books, short stories, and essays. In her later years, she worked as a translator. In her will, she donated her house to the “youth of Bulgaria,” and her residence now operates as a museum and meeting place for young writers.</p>

oh-reader,Au lecteur,"Oh, Reader!",Charles Baudelaire,Trask Roberts,"Au Lecteur
La sottise, l’erreur, le péché, la lésine,
Occupent nos esprits et travaillent nos corps,
Et nous alimentons nos aimables remords,
Comme les mendiants nourrissent leur vermine.
Nos péchés sont têtus, nos repentirs sont lâches;
Nous nous faisons payer grassement nos aveux,
Et nous rentrons gaiement dans le chemin bourbeux,
Croyant par de vils pleurs laver toutes nos taches.
Sur l’oreiller du mal c’est Satan Trismégiste
Qui berce longuement notre esprit enchanté,
Et le riche métal de notre volonté
Est tout vaporisé par ce savant chimiste.
C’est le Diable qui tient les fils qui nous remuent!
Aux objets répugnants nous trouvons des appas;
Chaque jour vers l’Enfer nous descendons d’un pas,
Sans horreur, à travers des ténèbres qui puent.
Ainsi qu’un débauché pauvre qui baise et mange
Le sein martyrisé d’une antique catin,
Nous volons au passage un plaisir clandestin
Que nous pressons bien fort comme une vieille orange.
Serré, fourmillant, comme un million d’helminthes,
Dans nos cerveaux ribote un peuple de Démons,
Et, quand nous respirons, la Mort dans nos poumons
Descend, fleuve invisible, avec de sourdes plaintes.
Si le viol, le poison, le poignard, l’incendie,
N’ont pas encor brodé de leurs plaisants dessins
Le canevas banal de nos piteux destins,
C’est que notre âme, hélas! n’est pas assez hardie.
Mais parmi les chacals, les panthères, les lices,
Les singes, les scorpions, les vautours, les serpents,
Les monstres glapissants, hurlants, grognants, rampants,
Dans la ménagerie infâme de nos vices,
II en est un plus laid, plus méchant, plus immonde!
Quoiqu’il ne pousse ni grands gestes ni grands cris,
Il ferait volontiers de la terre un débris
Et dans un bâillement avalerait le monde;
C’est l’Ennui! L’oeil chargé d’un pleur involontaire,
II rêve d’échafauds en fumant son houka.
Tu le connais, lecteur, ce monstre délicat,
— Hypocrite lecteur, — mon semblable, — mon frère!","Foolishness, error, sin, and greed find homes in our minds as they wear down our bodies. And from ourselves we nourish these loveable regrets, like lice feed on the beggar’s filthy form. Our sins are stubborn and our confessions false. But we pay dearly for them before once again taking the low road, believing that vile tears might wash away our stains. 
        On evil’s pillow lounges the pagan prophet, cradling our enchanted souls as he turns to steam what was once our icy resolve. And the Devil plays puppet master, dangling forbidden fruit in front of our noses as we coolly descend, step by step, through foul shadows into Hell. 
        Like that dusty tramp sucking at the martyred breast of an aged harlot, we hold tight to a pleasure that has long since run dry. In our brains, demons run wild as death tethers itself to our melancholy breath — each one a whisper closer to the last. 
        On the threadbare fabric of our destiny we should embroider something pleasing: poison, rape, knives, fire! No… we’re too weak for that. But among the monkeys, the panthers, the jackals and the scorpions, amid the vultures and snakes, and the screeching, slithering, whimpering savages in the zoo of our own perversion, one surpasses them all in its depravity. Though subdued in appearance, it would gladly crush the world and then consume it whole with a yawn. 
        Yes, you, Boredom! A tear sits on your eye, like a glass filled too full, as you dream of gallows while a cigarette smolders between your lips. And you, reader, you know this fragile monster. Admit it, my hypocrite reader. My reflection… My likeness… My brother!","<p>Whichever requirements for fidelity one has, the above translation does not meet them. This is immediately evident from my translation of the title, “Au Lecteur” which any good French 110 student would point out means, “To the Reader.” Where possible, through both my word choice and prosification of the poem, which renders it more letter-like, I highlight the poet’s complicity with the reader. The poem, as evidenced by its title, engages whichever reader happens upon it. “Au Lecteur” does not exclude the bourgeois reader, the uneducated reader, the unsympathetic reader, as certain earlier French writers are wont to do. Baudelaire chooses rather to begin in a manner that could be taken as a lament — <em>au lecteur</em> orally is the same as <em>Ô lecteur<em> (“Oh, reader”) — creating an immediate sense of intimacy and empathy between author and reader that the final stanza will cement.</p>","<p>Charles Baudelaire, born in Paris in 1821, was a <em>poète maudit</em>. He was a drinker, a revolutionary, a reluctant traveler, a translator, an opium addict, and an inspiration to countless poets who came after him, both in France and the world over.</p> 
<p>He hoped for his poetry to be one whose beauty would transcend whatever theme or content it provided. His prosody is traditional while his content is revolutionary. By incorporating vampires and corpses into strict meter and rhyme, Baudelaire plays on the tension between attractive form and repulsive content. He creates an important bridge from romanticism to modernism, but, like many artists, was held in great contempt for the risks he took.</p>
<p>His most famous collection of poems, <em>The Flowers of Evil</em>, was published in June 1857 and, by August of that year, Baudelaire found himself in a courtroom on charges of obscenity. The result was the exclusion of six poems from the work as well as a fine.</p>
<p>He continued to write, publish, and lecture up until a debilitating stroke in 1866. He died the following year.</p>",<p>Trask Roberts is a PhD candidate in French studies at Penn.

I am an Arab.
And the number of my identity card is 50,000.
And my children number 8,
and the ninth will come after the summer.
Are you not angry? 

Record!
I am an Arab.
And I work with comrades
In the quarry of stone,
and my children, they number 8.
And I carve for them their loaves of bread,
their notebooks, and their clothes
from this stone.
But never shall I kneel 
or beg for alms before your door,
and so I ask: are you not angry?

Record!
I am the Arab
who is called by no name,
who awaits the country that will come
from the eruption of anger. 
My roots became roots
long before my time of birth,
long before the ages blooming,
long before the season of cypress and olive
when the grass prayed for nourishment. 
My father comes from humble fields,
and not from noble sirs.
His father before him was a country-dweller,
with a history but not a memoir.  
My house is made from sticks and branches,
nothing but a shed to the warden.
Does the life in which I am called by no name
comfort you?

I am an Arab!
And the color of my hair 
is the coal from the quarry
and the color of my eyes
is the brown of the fields.

the kuffiyeh, the checkered cloth
and clasping cords on my head. 

My address:
I come from the village, Unknown to you.
And from its streets, Nameless to you. 
And its men? They work in the quarry of stone.
But still I ask: are you not angry?

And you imprisoned Karmah’s ancestors.
And you stole the homeland we once tilled,
I and all of my children.

for me and all of their children. 
Or shall your leaders take them, too?
As they had before threatened. 

What has happened has happened.

Hate has no place for my people,
And to thieve is the same. 
But if I were to starve,
I shall feast on the flesh of my oppressor. 
Beware.
Beware. 
Of my hunger.
And of my rage.","<p>I have translated this poem all while sobbing tears that aren’t mine. The process of translation is as painful as it is beautiful, and I only hope to have given these words of suffering and defiance the justice to be heard that they so solemnly deserve, and I am sorry if they have not done as such.</p>
<p>The pain of exile in the original — and in this version to an extent — is palpable, but the resilience of the human spirit, in all of its passivity, is inspiring. In this poem, I choose to focus not on regret, but on resistance, not on sorrow, but on struggle. I chose to do this because of the first time these words were spoken: boldly in front of a thunderous audience in a Nazareth movie house in May 1965. This declaration served as an historic extolment of the Arab world and reverberated a uniting pride in Arabism.</p>
<p>But I also chose to personalize the poem in a way that, though it betrays the original, allows for a dimension exposing my own identity. Towards the end of the poem, I translate a line as: </p>
<p>“And you imprisoned Karmah’s ancestors.”</p>
<p>The original, however, would read “and you stole the ancestor’s vineyards.” In Arabic, the word for “vineyard” is spoken as “<em>karmah</em>,” which also happens to be the name of my sister.</p>
<p>In bringing my own lineage to this line, I hope to pay homage to the grief associated with the tragic theft of sacred human life that occurred in my family and in the millions of others suffering as a result of displacement and dehumanization. I hope to codify not just the courage of the Arab in the poem, but the resilience of the human spirit with which we are all blessed.</p>
<p>Because to me, Darwish’s words are powerful not in that they are Darwish’s alone, but in that they are also those my father poetically recites as he drinks his morning coffee and those my mother beautifully sung as she nursed us to health that reveal the foundation of my pride in being a Palestinian living in America.</p>
","<p>Mahmoud Darwish was a Palestinian poet and author, widely regarded as the Palestinian national poet and “the man of action whose action was poetry.” In his widely recognized and celebrated works, Darwish uses the notion of Palestine and the suffering of the Palestinians as metaphors for the themes of expulsion from the Garden of Eden, the beauty of birth and resurrection, and the anguish of dispossession and exile. Darwish was born in the village of al-Birwa in Galilee in 1941 to a landed family who had been there for countless generations. In 1948, he and his family fled their homes following the establishment of the State of Israel when Israeli forces assaulted the region, and, in the process, razed and destroyed the town to prevent its previous inhabitants from returning.</p>
<p>After learning how to read from his grandfather, Darwish began to write poetry, publishing his first book, <em>Wingless Birds</em>, at the young age of nineteen. While also writing poetry, Darwish became more involved in political organizations, and he was ultimately banned from entering Israel in 1973 due to his affiliations. Thus, he wrote most of his poems and novels in exile, focusing on the painfully unfulfilled desire to return and the overwhelming feelings of nostalgia and resilience. With these tragic yet heroic emotions as the foundations for his art, he published more than thirty volumes of poetry and eight books of prose throughout his life.</p> 
<p>But even in death, Darwish could not return to his home. Immediately before he passed away in Houston, TX in 2008, he had requested to be buried in the village of his birth, al-Birwa. Such a request could not be granted due to the politics of the time, and he was nevertheless laid to rest in Ramallah, Palestine. His poems serve as a testament to the immense capacity for human suffering and the captivating beauty in resilience.</p>
","<p>Omar Khoury is a student at the University of Pennsylvania lost between the worlds of Middle Eastern history and English. Born to descendants of Palestinian refugees, Omar finds solace in the words of Darwish and comfort in the recognition that his painful desires for a long overdue return are shared by millions of people in all regions of the world. He has grown up listening to the words of Darwish in the hope that he, too, may one day see the image of the village overlooking the sea that his parents enchanted him with in longing stories and begging prayers.</p>",Arabic,ar,,,,,,,2017,submission
amerigo,Amerigo,Amerigo,Francesco Guccini,Stefano Pietrosanti,"Probabilmente uscì chiudendo dietro a se la porta verde, qualcuno si era alzato a preparargli in fretta un caffè d’orzo.
Non so se si girò, non era il tipo d’uomo che si perde
in nostalgie da ricchi, e andò per la sua strada senza sforzo.

Quand’io l’ho conosciuto, o inizio a ricordarlo, era già vecchio o così a me sembrava, ma allora non andavo ancora a scuola.
Colpiva il cranio raso e un misterioso e strano suo apparecchio, un cinto d’ernia che sembrava una fondina per la pistola.

Ma quel mattino aveva il viso dei vent’anni senza rughe e rabbia ed avventura e ancora vaghe idee di socialismo, parole dure al padre e dietro tradizione di fame e fughe
E per il suo lavoro, quello che schianta e uccide: “il fatalismo.”

Ma quel mattino aveva quel sentimento nuovo per casa e madre e per scacciarlo aveva in corpo il primo vino di una cantina
e già sentiva in faccia l’odore d’olio e mare che fa Le Havre, e già sentiva in bocca l’odore della polvere della mina.

L’America era allora, per me i G.I. di Roosvelt, la quinta armata, l’America era Atlantide, l’America era il cuore, era il destino,
l’America era Life, sorrisi e denti bianchi su patinata,
l’America era il mondo sognante e misterioso di Paperino.

L’America era allora per me provincia dolce, mondo di pace, perduto paradiso, malinconia sottile, nevrosi lenta,
e Gunga-Din e Ringo, gli eroi di Casablanca e di Fort Apache,
un sogno lungo il suono continuo ed ossessivo che fa il Limentra.

Non so come la vide quando la nave offrì New York vicino, dei grattacieli il bosco, città di feci e strade, urla, castello
e Pàvana un ricordo lasciato tra i castagni dell’Appennino,
l’inglese un suono strano che lo feriva al cuore come un coltello.




E fu lavoro e sangue e fu fatica uguale mattina e sera, per anni da prigione, di birra e di puttane, di giorni duri, di negri ed irlandesi, polacchi ed italiani nella miniera,
sudore d’antracite in Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Texas, Missouri.

Tornò come fan molti, due soldi e giovinezza ormai finita,
l’America era un angolo, l’America era un’ombra, nebbia sottile, l’America era un’ernia, un gioco di quei tanti che fa la vita,
e dire boss per capo e ton per tonnellata, “raif” per fucile.

Quand’io l’ho conosciuto o inizio a ricordarlo era già vecchio, sprezzante come i giovani, gli scivolavo accanto senza afferrarlo e non capivo che quell’uomo era il mio volto, era il mio specchio
finché non verrà il tempo in faccia a tutto il mondo per rincontrarlo, finché non verrà il tempo in faccia a tutto il mondo per rincontrarlo, finché non verrà il tempo in faccia a tutto il mondo per rincontrarlo.","Did somebody wake up to rush him an orzo when
he walked out and closed the green door behind him?
Did he turn back? He was not a man to get lost
in rich men’s nostalgia, he smoothly walked away.

An old man when I met him — in my memory so he appeared — I was not even in school.
That bald head, that weird, strange thing of his, a holster-like truss, struck me.

Yet that morning he wore an unwrinkled, twentyish face, with anger, wanderlust, vague socialist ideals.
Hard words for his father, a wealth of hunger and escapes on his back, and fatalism for his job, which knocks and kills.

Still, that morning brought new warmth for home and mother, to numb it and forget he drank the cellar’s first wine,
on his face he already felt Le Havre’s smell, of oil and sea, in his mouth he already tasted black powder and the mine.

America, to me, was then Roosvelt’s G.I.s, his fifth army. America was Atlantis, America was my heart, my destiny. America was Life, smiles so white on matte paper.
America was the mysterious, dreamy world of Paperino.

America was then sweet province to me, a paradise lost of peace, of subtle blues, of slow neurosis,
of Gunga-Din and Ringo, of Casablanca’s heroes and Fort Apache’s, a dream along Limentra’s pour, obsessive and incessant.

What was New York to him, as the liner sailed by? Did he see
the skyscrapers’ forest, the city of shit and streets, loud, castle-like? And Pàvana just an image, amidst Apennines and chestnuts,
while English stabbed his heart with knives of sound.

It was labor and blood, equal strain morning and evening,



years down a prison of beer and whores, of hard days, of Negroes and Irish, Poles and Italians in the mine,
sweating anthracite in Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Tex’, Missouri.

He crawled back as many, little money, his youth already spent. America just a corner, America the shadow, the fog, faint, America the hernia, a joke like many others that life plays,
the sound of boss for capo, of ton for tonnellata, of “raif” for fucile.

An old man when I met him — old in my memory —
I scornfully slipped beside him, young, without grasping how his face was my own, how he was my mirror,
how time would blow us back, the spiral ends rejoined how time would blow us back, the spiral ends rejoined how time would blow us back, the spiral ends rejoined.","<p>In this piece, Francesco Guccini wrote about destiny and afterthought. The song focuses on the figure of Enrico* — Guccini’s great-uncle — who left the village of Pàvana in the early twentieth century to work as a miner in the US.</p>
<p>I decided to translate a piece by Guccini because I see the organic evolution of the ``classical’’ tradition of Italian poetry in his work.** Due to my personal hobby of searching for conservative poetry — which is poetry infused with a certain sad love for small facts, for the imperfect life of men, for memory and roots, and for the careful crafting of phrases — in unexpected places, I cannot but pay homage.</p>
<p>I chose this particular song because I see a moving celebration of how personal lives repeat, of how we actually share experiences that we perceive as solitary struggles with others — before and after us – in it. Second, it is an interesting instance of how much of recent European culture developed in constant dialogue with and about the US.</p>

<p>In translating, I sacrificed literal meaning to favor the flow of phrases, in order to recreate the smooth rhythm of the song. Moreover, I often used direct questions where the original text does not; I decided not to translate <em>Paperino</em> as Donald Duck, and I stuck to Guccini’s pronunciation of the name “Texas” in the song, the truncation “Tex.”</p>","<p>Francesco Guccini was born in 1940 in Modena, Italy. He is known for being one of the foremost Italian <em>cantautori</em> (“singer-songwriters”). His first record, <em>Folk Beat n.1</em>, was produced in 1967, and Guccini released around twenty records in his forty-years long career. He is a teacher of Italian language at the Bologna off-campus school of Dickinson College. Guccini’s lyrics can be considered a bridge between Italian poetry and the singer-songwriters’ production of the Seventies/Eighties.</p>
","<p>Stefano Pietrosanti is an Italian PhD student in economics. He has studied in Rome, Turin, and, now, at the University of Pennsylvania. His work mostly focuses on how the real and banking/financial sectors interact. Having always been convinced that excessive specialization is boring, he tries his best to also put some effort into literature and political thought. In these fields, he is a happy amateur and an avid reader. As such, he got most of his recent amateurish fun from thinking about conservatism in arts and politics.</p>",Italian,it,,,,,,,2017,submission

Y se dejó caer, como abatida,
en los brazos del otro, usurpador, padrastro
que la sostuvo no con el respeto
que el siervo da a la majestad de reina
sino con ese abajamiento mutuo
en que se humillan ambos, los amantes, los cómplices.

La balanza
se sostuvo un instante sin moverse
y el grano de cacao quedó quieto en el arca
y el sol permanecía en la mitad del cielo

que fue, cuando partió como una flecha,
el ay agudo de las plañideras.

“Se deshojó la flor de muchos pétalos,
se evaporó el perfume,
se consumió la llama de la antorcha.

con trampa ante sus pies, con lazo de horca.

sobre algún cuerpo anónimo; un cadáver
que no era el mío porque yo, vendida
a mercaderes, iba como esclava,
como nadie, al destierro.

Arrojada, expulsada
del reino, del palacio y de la entraña tibia
de la que me dio a luz en tálamo legítimo
y que me aborreció porque yo era su igual
en figura y rango
y se contempló en mí y odió su imagen
y destrozó el espejo contra el suelo.

Yo avanzo hacia el destino entre cadenas
y dejo atrás lo que todavía escuchó:
los fúnebres rumores con los que se me entierra.

Y la voz de mi madre con lágrimas ¡con lágrimas!
que decreta mi muerte.","From the armchair of command my mother declared: “Dead.”

And she let herself fall, as if taken down,
into the arms of that other, the usurper, the stepfather 
who held her not with the respect
a servant bestows on a queen
but with that mutual abasement
which humiliates them both, lovers and accomplices.

From the Trading Plaza
my mother proclaimed: “Dead.”

The scales
stayed an instant
and the cacao stilled in its case
and the sun hung in the middle of the sky,
as if waiting for a sign
that was, when shot like an arrow,

the perfume evaporated,
the flame of the torch consumed itself.

where the midwife buried her umbilical cord.

She returns to the Place of Those Who Lived.

She recognizes her father, assassinated —
ay, no! — with poison, with a dagger,
with a trap at his feet, with a gallows rope.

They clasp hands and walk, walk
losing themselves in the fog.”

Such was the weeping, the wailing
over an anonymous body; a cadaver
that was not mine because I, sold
to slavers, went, a slave,
a no one, into exile.

Thrown out, expelled
from the kingdom, from the palace and the warm womb
of she who birthed me in legitimate marriage bed
and who despised me because I was her equal
in body and rank
and who saw herself in me and hated the image,
smashing the mirror against the ground.

leaving behind everything I can still hear:
the deathly rumors which bury me.

After her father, a ruler of an Aztec village, died, Malinche was sold by her mother to Mayan slavers. As a result, she spoke both Náhuatl (the language of the Aztecs) and Mayan. She was then given to the Spaniards as a gift, where she proved useful in helping them communicate with native people. She learned Spanish as well and rose in Cortés’s esteem, developing an intimate relationship with him and bearing him a child.</p>
<p>Malinche continues to be an important and controversial figure in Mexican culture. Historically, she has been viewed as a traitor to her people for assisting the Spaniards; however, some believe she has been unfairly scapegoated, her image mixed with that of Eve as treacherous woman, and that history has ignored the context of her life — particularly her enslavement — which influenced how she acted. Because she is such a significant cultural touchstone in Mexico, I wanted to retain a sense of her place by choosing to leave some understandable words in the original Spanish: <em>plaza</em>, <em>cacao</em>, and <em>ay</em>. I also wanted to retain a sense of time, since she was an actual historical figure, by utilizing some more antiquated words and phrases, such as “gallows,” “in legitimate marriage bed,” and “usurper.”</p>

Y las miro lejanas mis palabras.

Van trepando en mi viejo dolor como las yedras.
Ellas trepan así por las paredes húmedas.
Eres tú la culpable de este juego sangriento.

my words 
grow thin sometimes 
like the tracks of the gulls on the beaches. 

Necklace, a drunken bell, 
for your hands, smooth as grapes. 

From far away I watch my words. 
More than mine, they’re yours.
They climb up my dull pain like ivy.

They climb like this on the damp walls. 
You wear the guilt in this bloody game. 
They are fleeing my dark den. 
Everything filled by you, you fill everything. 

Before you, they lived in the solitude you inhabit,
and they are accustomed, more than you, to my sadness. 

Now I wish they would say what I want to say to you,
so that you might hear me the way I want you to. 

But the grieving wind often drags them away.
And hurricane dreams sometimes knock them down. 
You hear the other voices behind the ache in mine.  

Mourning ancient mouths, blood of ancient begging.

Follow me, my friend, beneath this wave of anguish.

This subject is reflective of Neruda’s work and the work of all poets: he is engaged in a constant practice of reaching to make contact. It is a never-ending process, an infinite necklace. In my translation, I sought to maintain the languid, sleepy mood that I feel when I read the poem in Spanish. When translating to English from Spanish, however, there will always be times when the words sound rougher than they do in their original romance language. When I found myself struggling with that, I tried to mold the roughness to be a part of the process that the poem is meditating on, part of the reaching and the growing, part of the infinite necklace.</p>

<p>First of all it should be noticed that the original text in Italian is pretty difficult to understand. My general approach toward translation was trying to render the meanings and the ideas conveyed by Ungaretti and choosing the words as carefully as possible.</p>
<p>The original title is “Tu ti spezzasti,” which is extremely challenging to translate while trying to keep the effect it has on the reader. <em>Spezzare</em> is a verb generally used to refer to a long object that breaks or is broken, like an arm or a branch. Moreover in Italian it is used for an idiomatic expression, <em>vita spezzata</em> — “shattered life.” It means a life that ended too soon. As for the grammatical form of the verb itself, <em>spezzarsi</em> is a reflexive verb, but Ungaretti decided to make it even stronger by adding <em>tu</em> at the beginning. I had to compromise with it, because in English I wasn’t able to find any solution that would fit while saving the purity of the English language.</p>
<p>I love the last line of the second stanza because of the image of the “perfect precarious balance.” In Italian the word <em>bilico</em>, used in this line, is slightly different from balance or equilibrium. It has embedded in it the nuance of precariousness. There is balance, but the Italian word focuses more on the lack of stability. That’s why I believe that <em>perfect precarious balance</em> exceptionally renders this idea conveyed by the original. Also, the sounds here are quite pleasant, due to the repetition of the letter <em>p</em>: “Magically appeared / In a perfect, precarious balance.”</p>
<p>As for the last stanza, I enjoyed trying to render the list of adjectives. The original said “empio, selvoso, accanito, ronzante,” which in my version became “heartless, savage, ruthless, stubborn.” There is a sort of correspondence between these four adjectives. The first and the third both end in <em>-less</em>; the second and the fourth both begin in <em>s-</em>. I think that overall they produce pleasant sounds, and give rhythm to the whole stanza. They pave the way to the <em>“glaring sun” of the last line. In the original the sun was “naked” (<em>ignudo</em>), but I decided to render it as “glaring.” I know that in this way I probably went against my own leading principle, namely trying to produce in the translation the same effect that the original had on the reader. Nevertheless I believe it was a necessary compromise with myself. The idea of a “glaring sun” is much more powerful, and it concludes the poem with a marvelous and melancholic image.</p>","<p>Giuseppe Ungaretti was born on February 10, 1888, in Alexandria, Egypt, to an Italian family originating from Lucca (Tuscany). Alexandria was a cosmopolitan city, full of stimuli that sparked his interest in different places and cultures.</p>
<p>Ungaretti is probably best remembered for his experiences during World War I. In Italy he is also known as <em>Il Poeta Soldato</em>, “the soldier poet.” In 1915, when Italy joined World War I, he decided to volunteer. World War I left a mark on his life. He got to know both the suffering of war as well as the true meaning of brotherhood. During the war he also wrote his most famous poem, the two line poem “Mattina,” which reads “M’illumino / d’immenso” (literally, “I illuminate myself of immensity”).</p>
<p>After marrying a French woman and having two children, Ungaretti and his family moved to Brazil, where he taught Italian literature. In Brazil, his beloved son Antonietto passed away. To mourn the death of his child, Ungaretti wrote the poem “Tu ti spezzasti.” It is not one of the most well-known of Ungaretti’s poems, but it is worth reading to experience the <em>pathos</em> it bears.</p>
<p>Giuseppe Ungaretti is certainly one of the most appreciated Italian poets of the twentieth century. What makes him great is firstly his experience of war, which gave his poetry such an introspective edge. He is also remembered for writing very incisive poems, short and concise, in which the true essence of his poetry is embedded.</p>

I cannot explain why what feels right feels that way; for me that’s part of the joy of surrender.</p>","<p>Federico García Lorca’s poetry is, in my opinion, some of the most beautiful in the world. In Spanish, his poetry has an extraordinary musicality to it. Indeed, much of his poetry was inspired by gypsy music and other lyric forms. I normally find reading Lorca in translation to be deeply dissatisfying because his musicality is difficult to convey given the diverse and primarily Germanic roots of English. In my translation, I tried my best to honor his sounds, and occasionally shifted some images from more direct translations so that they might better evoke the emotions that I feel they do in the original Spanish.</p>","<p>Mira Revesz is a senior at Swarthmore College, pursuing a special honors major that combines English, education, and religion.

פוחת וגורע
נחר ושוקע,
נפסד ונובל.
ועם זאת,
אולי ענני הגשם מצְבִּים את בטנו,
דומה שהוא גדל.
הינומה דקה פרושה על פני השמים.
הירח פוחת ושוקע
כאילו נתקטע,
כאילו הוא נופל.

sinks itself
into the sunlight
Still
the rainclouds might
fill up its belly
and it will seem larger
A veil sails across the sky
The moon sinks 
into the light
Clouds sent it to rot
But
Wait
Behind it rises
a blinding ring 
a half-month moon 
rising 
blinding 
Light as a seed
in the seams of the sky
Round as a gourd and as ripe
This is the moon that sinks
this is the moon that withers
Come gaze at it, my dear,
it always reappears.","<p>Translating Dahlia Ravikovitch’s “Sinking rising,” or, as it is more commonly called, “Waxing, Waning,” posed several complications. The first was the lack of inflection in English. In inflecting languages such as Hebrew, the subject and tense is implied in each verb, so more is said in fewer words. Here, the inflecting property lends a sort of minimalist quality to the poem, with most lines having two words, and at the same time allows it a density, both words being verbs. Because the minimalism is tied to the content of the poem, I chose to emphasize that quality over the density in the translation, leaving out near-synonym verbs when the lines became too long.</p>
<p>The second challenge was presenting that minimalism as being tied to the content of the poem, which is a simple observation of how the physical waxing and waning of the moon looks to us. The waxing and waning moon is an eons-old and content-laden metaphor in the Hebrew consciousness, and yet here it is presented with a bare simplicity, the matter-of-fact tone reverberating in each of the images. Ravikovitch’s gaze at the moon, while hinting at its rich metaphoric roots in language (the word for “middle of the month” is Biblical) and theme (an ever-returning moon), is mostly observational, seeing the moon as an intriguing, disappearing object in the sky, instead of as a metaphor. That simplicity is expressed in the original in the small number of words used as well as in the rising and falling sound of the vowels chosen (many of them have an <em>ey-ah</em> sound). As previously noted, I tried to mimic that minimalist tendency by keeping the lines short, but also by removing much of the punctuation. I did capitalize some letters despite the fact that Hebrew does not have capitalization to preserve the ebb and flow of the cadence. With regard to the rising and falling sounds that reflect the waxing and waning of the moon, I tried to transmit the way the poem physically reflects the focus on the moon’s physical shape with the shape of the poem (in its rounded lines and curving shape as a whole) instead of sound.</p>
<p>One last note is about the title: I chose “Sinking, rising” as opposed to “Waxing, waning” because the latter is too closely associated with moon allusions and metaphors. Because the words sinking and rising are not usually associated with the moon, they seemed a better fit for describing a layperson’s observation of the physical phenomenon.</p>

가을로 가득 차 있습니다.

나는 아무 걱정도 없이
가을 속의 별들을 다 헤일 듯합니다.

가슴속에 하나 둘 새겨지는 별을
이제 다 못 헤는 것은
쉬이 아침이 오는 까닭이요,
내일 밤이 남은 까닭이요,
아직 나의 청춘이 다하지 않은 까닭입니다.

별 하나에 추억과
별 하나에 사랑과
별 하나에 쓸쓸함과
별 하나에 동경과
별 하나에 시와
별 하나에 어머니, 어머니,

어머님, 나는 별 하나에 아름다운 말 한 마디씩 불러 봅니다. 소학교 때 책상을 같이 했던 아이들의 이름과, 패, 경, 옥, 이런 이국 소녀들의 이름과 벌써 아기 어머니 된 계집애들의 이름과, 가난한 이웃 사람들의 이름과, 비둘기, 강아지, 토끼, 노새, 노루, 프랜시스 잼, 라이너 마리아 릴케, 이런 시인의 이름을 불러 봅니다.

이네들은 너무나 멀리 있습니다.
별이 아슬히 멀듯이.

어머님,
그리고 당신은 멀리 북간도에 계십니다.

나는 무엇인지 그리워
이 많은 별빛이 내린 언덕 위에
내 이름자를 써 보고
흙으로 덮어 버리었습니다.

딴은 밤을 새워 우는 벌레는
부끄러운 이름을 슬퍼하는 까닭입니다 .

그러나 겨울이 지나고 나의 별에도 봄이 오면
무덤 위에 파란 잔디가 피어나듯이
내 이름자 묻힌 언덕 위에도
자랑처럼 풀이 무성할 게외다.","In the sky where seasons pass,
autumn fills the air.

Without any hesitation, 
I will count the stars deep in autumn.

All the stars engraved in my chest,
I cannot count them all
because morning comes too soon,
because tomorrow’s evening still remains,
because my youth is still incomplete.

One star for memory
One star for love
One star for loneliness
One star for longing
One star for poem
One star for mother, mother.
 
Mother, I attempt to call out to each star its beautiful name.
Names of the children I shared a desk with in primary school, names of foreign girls such as Pae, Kyung, Ok, names of girls who have already become mothers, names of penniless neighbors, names of animals like pigeon, dog, rabbit, mule, deer, and names of poets such as Francis Jammes, Rainer Maria Rilke, 
I attempt to call them.

They are too far
in the way stars are infinitely distant.

And Mother,
you are far off in North Kando.

I grieve for some unknown
on top the hill where a fountain of starlights falls.
I write my name
and cover it up with soil.

And the cicadas cry through the night
over my shameful name.

But when winter passes and spring arrives, even to my star,
in the way green grass blooms on graves,
on top of the hill where my name is buried,
like pride, grass will lusciously overflow.
","<p>Like many translations, the decisions on word choice and how to structure the sentences and phrases throughout were incredibly difficult. Inherently, Korean and English have grammar structures that are completely the opposite of one another, which makes forming a literal translation more difficult. In terms of word choice, in some areas I decided to take more liberties, while in others, I stayed true to the original, more so than other translations I had read. There were a few phrases in which I decided to add an extra word because I felt that in order to convey the meanings that are packed into the original word. I had to include “attempt to” or “some unknown,” rather than “call” or “something,” respectively, on their own to bring out the full impact that I received from reading the original and put it in my translation. The second “I attempt to call them” is also an emphasis that does not maintain as much power and impact in the original as in my translation. But to underline the idea that the narrator tries to call upon these stars, he is unable to fully do so because they are so far away. Further, in the original the word “cicada” is not present. Rather, it is a general term for “insect” or “bug,” but the specific insect presents not only some alliteration but also a warmer feeling and allows for a more intense auditory experience.</p>
<p>I wanted to maintain the structure of the poem as much as possible and not exclude anything major that exists in the original in my translation. The fifth stanza seems more like prose stuck between a series of poems, but upon actually reading it, it flows relatively quickly, so I decided to keep it in the same format but included the “names of…” on a separate line so that it wouldn’t be too much of a mouthful. However, the rest of the poem remains faithful to the original to maintain the same flow and pauses. Throughout the translation, enhancing the myriad of emotions and bringing to life the visuals of each sentence, phrase, or word were the aspects I worked to pay attention to the most.</p>
","<p>Yun Dong-ju was a Korean poet who was born in 1917 in the Myeongdong village of Jilin in China and died in 1945 at the age of twenty-seven in Fukuoka, Japan. From 1910 to 1945, Korea was colonized by Japan and underwent “cultural cleansing,” which was enacted through a series of unfair and often violent methods. Koreans were prohibited to speak Korean, write in Korean, own Korean books, teach and learn in Korean, and hold their Korean names. It soon became dangerous for Yun to write in Korean, as it was interpreted by the Japanese to be a rebellion. Yun’s older cousin, Song Mongyu, was a huge influence in his life as well. As a talented prose writer and an activist in the Korean independence movement, Song himself worked with Yun and a few other college friends to create literary magazines back in Yeonhi University, which is now Yeonsae University. Song potentially instilled in Yun the desire to refuse complete submission from the Japanese rule by continuing to write the Korean poetry he loved so much. Upon completing his education there, he moved to Rikkyo University in Tokyo and then transferred six months later to Doshisha University in Kyoto, where he was soon taken captive by the Japanese police to Fukushima prison, where he died, most likely as a victim of medical experiments. Yun never was able to publish his collection of poems, <em>Star, Sky, Wind, and Poetry</em>, because he was arrested as a revolutionary activist, but because he had given them to a close friend in Korea, Chong Pyong-uk, to hide until it was able to be published, Yun’s poems exist today for many to read.</p>","<p>Nadia Park is a student at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in communications and minoring in consumer psychology and French.

giants fastened these walls, these gaping gashes

the foundations laid by those who by then too

through a grave dampened by baths now
gripped in gray and gurgling ash, swallowed
in wells of the past — one hundred generations

wine-flushed skin and floods that gleamed, where
those twin pearls might be slipped beneath
stony shadows shading over hot streams.","<p>“The Ruin” is rich in physically descriptive imagery of a ruined city. The exact location of the city alluded to, and whether it is in fact an actual city and not a spiritual metaphor constructed by the poet, is still debated by scholars. The belief that “The Ruin’s” author was inspired by Bath or another Roman scene guides us to imagine the author as someone in awe of the accomplishments of the master builders of ancient Rome; it is from this perspective that I wrote my own translation. Rather than viewing the city as a metaphor for the human body (which is not uncommon among medieval Christian texts) and exploring the poem as one with a moralizing, religious theme, I chose to wade through the emotions of reimagining a site that has been lost. The speaker of my poem asks what it means to yearn for a time that was never her own, to stand at the site of a sunken past.</p>
<p>With the liberties that I’ve taken in writing “Ruin,” although I have attempted to echo the speaker’s meditative mood, my poem is more aptly called an adaptation than a translation, in terms of both content and form. An individual line of Old English poetry consists of two half-lines, where each half-line has two accented syllables, and the two half lines are bound together by alliteration of the accented syllables. While I did not consistently employ half-lines, alliteration and its coincidence with accented syllables was important in crafting the sound of this poem. One thing that I find most wonderful about Old English is its creation of new words through kennings and compounds, and in response I created original compounds in my translation.</p>","<p>“The Ruin” is a fragmentary poem found in Exeter, Cathedral Chapter Library, MS 3501, the Exeter Book.

——人的一生，也可以象一座博物馆吗

一

最起初 只有那一轮山月
和极冷极暗记忆里的洞穴

然后你微笑着向我走来
在清凉的早上 浮云散开

既然我该循路前去迎你
请让我们在水草丰美的地方定居
我会学着在甲骨上卜凶吉
并且把爱与信仰 都烧进
有着水纹云纹的彩陶里

那时侯 所有的故事
都开始在一条芳香的河边
涉江而过 芙蓉千朵
诗也简单 心也简单

二

雁鸟急飞 季节变异
沿着河流我慢慢向南寻去
曾刻过木质观音浑圆的手
也曾细雕着 一座
隋朝石佛微笑的唇

迸飞的碎粹之后 逐渐呈现
那心中最亲爱与最熟悉的轮廓
在巨大阴冷的石窟里
我是谦卑无怨的工匠
生生世世 反复描摹

三

可是 究竟在哪里有了差错
为什么 在千世的轮回里
我总是与盼望的时刻擦肩而过
风沙来前 我为你
曾经那样深深埋下的线索
风沙过后 为什么
总会有些重要得细节被你遗漏

归路难求 且在月明的夜里
含泪为你斟上一杯葡萄美酒
然后再急拔琵琶 催你上马
那时候 曾经水草丰美的世界
早已进入神话 只剩下
枯萎的红柳和白杨 万里黄沙

四

去又往返 仿佛
总有潮音在暗夜里呼唤
胸臆间满是不可解的温柔
用五彩丝线绣不完的春日
越离越远 云层越积越厚
我斑驳的心啊
在传说与传说之间缓缓游走

五

今生重来与你重逢
你在柜外 我已在柜中
隔着一片冰冷的玻璃
我热切地等待着你的来临
在错谔间 你似乎听到一些声音
当然你绝不可能相信
这所有的绢 所有的帛
所有的三彩和泥塑
这柜中所有的刻工和雕纹啊
都是我给你的爱 都是
我历经千劫百难不死的灵魂

六

在暮色里你漠然转身 渐行渐远
长廊寂寂 诸神静默
我终于成木成石 一如前世
廊外 仍有千朵芙蓉
淡淡地开在水中

还有那雪样的白

At the very beginning   only the band of a rocky moon
the cavern in an infinitely dark and cold memory

You were walking towards me with a smile
on that cool and clear morning       the floating clouds parting

If I should trace that path to welcome you
please let us settle in a land of lushness and bounty
I would pore over oracle bones to learn the secrets of augury
fire both love and faith into rainbow pottery 
adorned with water and cloud impressions

Back then       all the stories
had begun next to a long fragrant river
Wade through the stream       hibiscuses in bloom
the poem was simple       and the heart too

Two.
Rushed flight of geese       the seasons changing
Along the river I slowly seek towards the south
The hand that once engraved goddesses of mercy
has also meticulously carved out
a Sui Buddha’s tender stone lips

After the fragments spark and fly       it finally emerges
those dearest and most familiar contours of the heart
Within the gigantic, wet and cold grottoes
I am a modest and placid artist
life after life       mimicking trace after trace

Three.
But       where did we really go wrong
Why is that       through a thousand reincarnation rounds
I always barely miss that longed-for moment
Before the sands came       for you
I had once buried deep all the signs and evidence
After the sands came       why
would you always forget some serendipitous reach

A struggle of return        might as well in that moonlit night
pour you a cup of wine through rapidly blinking tears
Blast through the pipa       urge you to mount and ride
By now       what had been a bountiful land
has already entered myth       leaving behind only
withered willows and poplars       miles upon miles of desert dreams

Four.
To go is to return       almost
constant calls of the eventide in the shadowy night
between the breast an indecipherable gentleness
The spring that even rainbow silk threads cannot embroider
sinking farther and farther away       storm clouds gathering strength
My mottled heart
gliding ponderously between legend and faith

Five.
Reincarnating to meet you again
You live outside the cabinet       I already breathe within it
Separated by but a shard of cold glass
I earnestly wait for your arrival
Between error and disbelief       you capture their voices
of course you wouldn't ever believe
that every piece of samite and taffeta here
every painted man and earthen sculpture
every enclosed carved and engraved relief
are my love for you
my persevering unwavering immortal souls…

Six.
In the twilight you turn away in indifference       your steps fading
a lonely gallery       the deities falling silent
I finally become wood and stone       just as departed memory
outside the gallery       still a thousand florets of hibiscus

soft violet       gentle rose
and that snow-like paleness
mirroring an anonymous ancient likeness
slowly imbibing from the stream of time       slowly diminish","<p>Xi’s poems are well-known and loved for their lyricism, references to ancient Asian (Chinese and Buddhist) philosophies, astute observations on life and love, and yearning for empathy and meaning.

I particularly struggled with the third and fifth stanzas due to her rampant use of repeating Chinese characters.

running sober in my veins.

September tapped at my window
with a red willow branch,
ensuring I would greet it
on its unassuming arrival.

I now choose to make peace;
I feel no pressure, no loss.
These cemeteries, these cottages,
this Russia seems different. 

I look around, and I can see
it written across the sky,
that you alone, sister and friend,
can be this poet’s companion.

That I can sing to you alone,

about twilight on the road

","<p>As someone with a fondness for fancy words, I often find translating Yesenin to be an exercise in restraint. His style is uncluttered, often colloquial, and sometimes abrupt. He paints pictures with words you wouldn’t quite associate with what he is trying to convey — when you think about the essence of a country, do you picture cemeteries and huts? Yesenin does. The “huts” also posed a problem — when you hear the word “hut” in English, what do you think of? Probably not a ramshackle peasant house in the countryside, which is what Yesenin meant (in the end, I went with “cottage”). He repeatedly refers to his “hooliganism” (a recurring theme in his poetry) — a sentiment I used two words to convey: “pranks” and “mischief.” I also chose to step back from Yesenin’s tight rhyme scheme in favour of a freer structure. I felt it better allowed me to express the poet’s calm acceptance of falling in love and the new energy it’s given him.</p>","<p>Sergei Yesenin (Сергей А. Есенин, 1895–1925) was known as the “peasant prophet.” A Russian Imaginist, he was flamboyant and his poetry unornamented. He drew on his background and village lifestyle and lore for inspiration.
