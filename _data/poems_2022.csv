i-too-am-a-riddle,प्रिय! मैं हूँ एक पहेली भी,"I, Too, Am a Riddle",Mahadevi Varma,Anjali Gupta,"प्रिय! मैं हूँ एक पहेली भी !

जितना मधु जितना मधुर हास
जितना मद तेरी चितवन में
जितना क्रन्दन जितना विषाद
जितना विष जग के स्पन्दन में
पी पी मैं चिर दुख-प्यास बनी
सुख-सरिता की रंगरेली भी !

मेरे प्रतिरोमों से अविरत,
झरते हैं निर्झर और आग;
करती विरक्ति आसक्ति प्यार,
मेरे श्वासों में जाग जाग;
प्रिय मैं सीमा की गोदपली
पर हूँ असीम से खेली भी !","My love, I, too, am a riddle.

The nectar, the honeyed laughter, 
The lust in your glances, 
The lamentation, the despair, 
All the poison in this quivering world.  

I drink, I drink it all, and yet I thirst for sorrow 
And bathe in the river of joy. 

From every fiber of my being 
Both the fire and water fall. 
Renunciation and devotion join 
In my panting breath. 

My love, I was born to the lap of limitation,
But I, too, have loved in the limitless.","<p>This poem speaks to me of duality, conflict, and devotion. I really wanted to convey the complexity and confusion in this poem. There is a palpable tension and urgency that needs to be prioritized. </p>
<p>As in all translations, I had to compromise. I struggled with the translation of <span lang= ""hi"">प्रिय</span> (<em>priya</em>), appearing as both the poem’s first word and towards the end. The whole poem hinges on this one word. Because it is a direct address, it sets the tone for the poem and makes it an intimate conversation. Previous translators conveyed this as “beloved,” and “dear one.” These felt antiquated and awkward to me. I chose to translate this as “my love” because it felt more colloquial and like a gentle whisper. </p>
<p>Another thing I struggled with is the loss of linguistic and cultural ancestors when words are dragged from Hindi to English. For example, in line 3, the word <span lang= ""hi"">मद</span> (<em>mad</em>) means something along the lines of “intoxicant,” “frenzy,” and “lust” and has visual connotations of liquid oozing. I could not find the elusive perfect word in English. When words are used, historical and cultural histories are invoked. As I have supplanted this poem across languages, the history and culture is altered. As the poet draws on mythologies and literature, I straddle the line between truth to tradition and to the flow of the narrative.</p>
<p>I present this translation from a place of vulnerability. As a third-generation American, I am not a native speaker of the language that my grandparents speak and that I am translating here. I can only promise that I have chosen each word, down to the syllable, with the utmost care and with the loving help of my grandmother.</p>","<p>Born in 1907 in India to a liberal family, Mahadevi Varma was a poet, feminist, and scholar. She attended the Crosthwaite Girls College at Allahabad and graduated in 1929. Her first poetry collection was published in 1930; she went on to publish seven other works as well as an extensive selection of prose. Over the course of her literary career, she received numerous awards including the Padma Bhushan and the Jnanpith Award. She was an essential figure in the Chhayavad school of Hindi literature. </p>
<p>She is a greatly lauded figure for her work in poetry and advocacy and is accredited with drastically revolutionizing women’s education in her time. She pushed for modernity and enacted positive change in all aspects of her life. </p>","<p>Anjali Gupta is a senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying linguistics.

Ella es una sábana ﬂotando sobre nosotros.
Nada detiene el remolino que alienta su vuelo.
Desde su vientre deshabitado
los ovarios violeta se abren como ﬂores nocturnas.
La ansiedad es un arrecife
donde acerados corales hieren los cuerpos amados.

Sin hijos bajo sus ojos
quisiéramos las madres
ofrecerle un trozo de pañal
para vendar sus muñones o un arca
donde recoger los salados restos.

                                                             was leaning in the doorway of her home, thinking 
                                                             of winged and brimming pots. Suddenly she fell into
                                                             an abyss, from which she emerged old and hunched. She didn’t

She is a sheet floating above us.
Nothing restrains the whirlwind that keeps her aloft.
From her deserted womb
violet ovaries unfurl like night-blooming flowers.
Anxiety is a reef
where sharpened corals wound beloved bodies.

Without children in her sight
we mothers would like
to offer her a piece of diaper cloth
to bandage her stumps or an ark
to gather the salty remains.
","<p>This poem originally appeared in <em>Hijos</em> (<em>Children</em>, 1991), a sublimely beautiful collection of Muñoz’s poems centered around pregnancy and motherhood. This image-rich, heart-aching piece — the final poem in the collection — is based on a real event from the time. In a historical context, such tragedies occur all too often in the maritime culture of Chiloé, as perhaps they do in other places, and the individual loss and grief conveyed become universal in significance. The particular language and imagery of Muñoz’s poetry, however, is specific to the culture, lore and landscape of the Chiloé archipelago, and is one of the most essential elements throughout her entire body of work.</p>
<p>We learn of the tragic loss in the first line and throughout the first stanza. In robbing her of her children, the sea not only took them — <em>se los llevó</em>, but “took them away”; the line becomes more similar in length to the original and emphasizes the loss. While their mother leaned in the doorway, awaiting their safe return and anticipating a successful catch, the pots of fish and seafood stew she was already planning would not merely be full, but <em>rebosantes</em> — “brimming” in joyous abundance. The traditional clay pots, with handles like folded “wings,” embody the magic of the hearth, the reward for such hard, often dangerous, labor at sea. She is endowed by the poet — a mother of three herself — with a powerful, unquestionable sense of maternal intuition. She somehow knows and feels the ultimate loss before her husband hears the tragic news reported on the radio. An abyss of devastation swallows her and spits her out, shrunken and aged. In a traditional culture not unfamiliar with tragedies at sea, it isn’t odd that she is already “dressed in black” and “gathering flowers” by the time he comes outside, “helpless and trembling.”</p>
<p>The second stanza addresses not only the mother in the first stanza, but all grieving mothers, forever unmoored. In the second line, my approach to translating the image into English resulted in a more adaptive choice. From the original, “nada detiene el remolino que alienta su vuelo,” <em>remolino</em> can mean a whirlpool or a whirlwind. Instead of the more obvious reference to water, I chose the reference to air, for its connection to the rest of the phrase, <em>que alienta su vuelo</em> (“that encourages her flight”), and settled on “nothing restrains the whirlwind that keeps her aloft.”</p>
<p>Without children of her own in sight, she is maimed forever by the loss. The other mothers know there’s no possible consolation, but can only offer gestures of compassion.</p>","<p>Rosabetty Muñoz is a Chilean poet and teacher from the southern city of Ancud, on the island of Chiloé. Her lifelong dedication to both poetry and education are matched by her dedication to the people and places she has always known, and always refused to move away from. Her entire body of work is infused with and inspired by Chilote landscape, culture and legends, as well as the inevitable, present-day clash of changing cultures. Passionate about language, she seeks to inspire her students, and her readers in general, to become enchanted by the words they hear. Her own voice has been described as uncomplicated, often minimalist in appearance, yet deeply metaphysical and complex, sounding at times almost like a prayer or a hymn that moves the reader into a contemplative state. Her titles include <em>Canto de una oveja del rebaño</em>, <em>En lugar de morir</em>, <em>Hijos</em>, <em>Baile de señoritas</em>, <em>La santa: Historia de su elevación</em>, <em>Sombras en el Rosselot</em>, <em>Ratada</em>, <em>En nombre de ninguna</em>, and the anthology <em>Misión circular</em>. Her work has appeared in international anthologies, and has claimed many notable prizes, including the Pablo Neruda Prize and the Altazor, among many others. She has also been named a member of the Academia Chilena de la Lengua.</p>","<p>Claudia Nuñez de Ibieta translates and interprets within Spanish and English.

unwavering,Manteniéndome firme,Unwavering,Zoraida Armengol,Pablo Abrante,"Para que no se enojen
las musas de las avenidas,
escribo en mis tiempos libres;
para mantenerme viva.

Para que no se aleje
el salitre con alas vistiendo,
escribo sobre el hermoso encanto;
para seguir existiendo.

Para que no se arrepientan
las luces tenues encendidas,
escribo cuando nadie sabe;
para continuar de pie, erguida.

Para que no se espanten
el ir y venir del quehacer,
escribo con más ganas de antes;
para vivir un poco más que ayer.

Para que ambas a mí acudan,
las lágrimas y la maravilla,
escribo en fracciones de segundos;
para saberme realmente viva.","So as not to anger the avenue
muses, I write
in my free time;
so to keep myself alive.

So the saltpeter wearing wings
doesn’t fly away drifting,
I write of beautiful delight;
so to keep existing.

So the dim lights don’t
regret turning on at all,
I write when no one knows;
so to keep afoot, standing tall.

So as not to scare off the
come and go of work and play,
I write more earnestly than before;
so to live a bit more than yesterday.

So tears and wonder
both might arrive,
I write in fractions of seconds;
so to know myself truly alive.","<p>i adore formal poetry.</p>
<p>this poem was tough to translate without sacrificing the rhyme — i’m very thankful for my friend Olive’s help here! i like to say that, when translating, <em>something has to go</em>, be it tone, literalness, or rhyme. i think that translation means composing a poem like a native speaker of another language, but if you keep the form, you usually sacrifice literal meaning.</p>
<p>take <em>alas vistiendo</em>: a native speaker might compose that flourish as “dressed in wings,” but then how do we rhyme that with “existing”?
<em>arrepientan</em> doesn’t have an object in the Spanish… <i>what exactly would the dim lights regret?</i></p>
<p><em>de pie, erguida</em> means “on my feet, standing straight,” but that’s so many words and the tone is all formal. the expression is physical, but the poet clearly uses it symbolically as well.</p>
<p>i took advantage of those ambiguous moments and a little enjambment to preserve the rhyme. the rhythm is light in spanish, whereas my translation stretches and crunches back and forth. something had to go, i think.</p>
<p>the repetition of <em>para</em> was another obstacle, since most literally that’s “for” or at least “in order to.” even my choice to go with “so” is more formal than the relatively neutral register <em>para</em>, but it keeps the motif without taking up too much space. i knew i wanted to translate this poem as soon as i read it. the more i sat with this piece, the more it grew on me. hopefully it’s a reminder to keep <em>me</em> writing; i, too, am keeping alive.</p>

whispered,Tiše,Whispered,František Halas,Kathryn Dettmer,"Kláskem hubeným je tělo tvé

jak klásek hubený je tělo tvé

Přadenem z hedvábí je tělo tvé
toužením popsané do vrásky poslední
jak přadeno z hedvábí je tělo tvé

Spáleným nebem je tělo tvé
čivavě v tkáni smrtka sní
jak spálené nebe je tělo tvé

Přetiché je tělo tvé

jak tiché je tělo tvé

<h1>Jistota</h1>

Vcházím do lásky a oslepen
tápám klopýtaje o tmu minulou
milostí tvojí zasažen

Prohledám náhle a již vím
není mi dáno zůstat v tomto ráji
tolik jsem prahnul a přece sem nepatřím

Míjím ač ničeho se nezříkám
zahleděn v tvé oči vznešené
půl smrt půl stín se vkradu tam

","A thin stalk is your body
from which grain fell without sprouting
how like a thin stalk is your body

A skein of silk is your body
desire written on the tissues’s every last wrinkling
how like a skein of silk is your body

furtively, a banshee with it, in the weaving
how like a burning sky is your body

The quiet is your body
its cry sets my eyelids trembling
how like the quiet is your body

<h1>Certitude</h1>

I enter into love and while blinded
feel my way, stumbling into the dark past
of your stricken mercies

I ransack and, unexpectedly and already, I know
it is not a given for me to stay in this paradise
I have so longed and yet do not belong

I pass though I renounce nothing
while staring into your noble eyes
there, I steal into half death half shadow
","<p>The poems here were chosen from the book <em>Krásné neštěstí</em> (<em>Beautiful Bad Luck</em> – or <em>Unhappiness</em>, depending on how you read it), which was first published in 2006 by one of Halas’s sons, a well-known radio presenter in the Czech Republic. The poems were published for the first time alongside the letters that Halas sent them in, to his wife, between the years 1928 and 1939. None of her correspondence is included in the volume.</p>
<p>I chose both poems because they delighted and challenged me. The first thing I discovered is that making things rhyme in Czech is much easier than in English. I was only able to preserve the rhyme in “Whispered,” but since Halas was often accused of not being poetic enough, I figured he would not mind.</p>

","<p>František Halas was born in Moravia in 1901 (when it was still part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and died in 1949. He was an active member of the communist Czech resistance to the Nazis and wrote for the illegal communist newspaper, <em>Rudé Pravo</em>. When he died, he was a celebrated poet, an editor at Orbis Publishing House, and the head of the writers‘ union of the Ministry of Information. His poetry, however, was lyrical in nature, eventually leading to a falling out with the communist regime. He was not dialectic enough for communist tastes. During the Prague Spring of 1968, one of his sons, Ludvig Kundera (father of writer Milan Kundera), and others published a book that revived interest in Halas’s early lyric poetry.</p>
<p>Milan Kundera puts Halas’s poems in the hands of the main character of the novel <em>The Joke</em> (<em>Žert</em>), which is how I was introduced to Halas. The protagonist wallows in the poems because he has been exiled for a bad joke. He uses them to seduce a girl, who is happier to hear them than she is with his physical advances. Halas’s poems are melodramatic and strange — my favorite kind of love poem.</p>","<p>Kathryn A.

And my heart has moaned and my heart has been quiet...
It’s no wonder the night has become dear, then.

<h1>Extinguish the Sun (<em>Farlesh Di Zun</em>)</h1>

Almighty! And may it be Your will:
No more silence, no forgiving... 
My final prayer comes to You bloodied:
Extinguish the sun, the light of living.
 
Extinguish the sun and give Your creations

Poison the fields, burn the last of the crops,
Enough to feed those who had cruel ways...

","<p>
I chose to translate these two poems, as they share a motif of sunlight portrayed negatively. I usually associate sunlight with hope and joy, so seeing it used here to highlight the cruelty of man, or as this entity that should be blunted, as a curse to the world, was very striking.
</p>
<p>
I understood the line “what Man has made of men” to describe the evil humanity is capable of perpetrating. To emphasize this interpretation, as well as to highlight the slightly unusual choice of man in both singular and plural (<em>mentsh</em> and <em>mentshn</em> in Yiddish), I chose to capitalize Man.
</p>
<p>
In the line “For the image still wanders and my heart is not blind,” the Yiddish has the word <em>homloz</em>. The literal English translation of “homeless” evokes different emotions in English than the original Yiddish, so I used the word “wanders” instead, which seemed to better express my understanding that while one can physically cover the source of the horror, the dead bodies, the horror still stays within. The image of this horror is homeless, meaning it wanders inside such that the heart cannot avert its “eyes.”
</p>
<p>
For “Let the wind cry with blood for all of our kind,” the Yiddish uses the phrase <em>far undz ale</em> literally, “for us all.” Who is the “us”? Is it Jewish people? Is it humankind? I chose to use “for all of our kind,” believing this portion of the poem to be specially about Jews, since the phrase “barren roads of Poland” seems to reference the nearly three million Polish Jews killed. Such a severe decrease in the population would make roads, especially in previously predominantly Jewish areas, seem starkly barren.
</p>
<p>
The two poems are from the collection entitled <em>Dortn</em> (<em>There</em>, 1946), referring to pre-Holocaust Poland. I first read selections from <em>Dortn</em> on Tisha B’Av, the fast day in the Jewish calendar that commemorates the destruction of the ancient Jewish temples. In the last decades, it has become common for Jewish people to recount the tragedy of the Holocaust as a way to approach this 2,000-year-old tragedy. While reading these poems of horror, loss, and grief, I also found beauty. In flipping through the book, I opened to a spot where yellow flowers, stems still attached, had been pressed between the pages. I can never know who placed these flowers or when. Though the flower presser is most certainly gone, their flowers, the book itself, and the language are not.

Zusman Segalovitsh was born in Białystok, Poland in 1884. He wrote in both Russian and Yiddish and penned both poetry and prose. His books were well read in Poland. Segalovitsh had multiple close encounters with death during his life: a 1906 pogrom in Białystok, serving in the Russian army for a year, and fleeing the Holocaust between 1939 and 1941 before finally arriving in Tel Aviv. In his escape, he went through Lithuania, Russia, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Syria. During and after the war, he dedicated himself to memorializing Polish Jewry in his writings. <em>Dortn</em> was published in 1946, three years before his passing.

The promises mutilated by the shock of machine guns
Strange men who were not men
You knew all the books you did not know love
And the hands that fertilize the womb of the earth
The roots of our hands deep as revolt
In spite of your songs of pride in the midst of mass graves
The desolate villages Africa torn apart
Hope lived in us like a citadel
And from the mines of Swaziland to the heavy sweat of the factories of Europe
Spring will take flesh under our steps of light.

David Diop’s “The Vultures” describes the destructive collaboration of Christian missionaries and French colonizers in Africa. Translator Ulli Beier renders the second line (“à coups de gueule de civilisation”) as “when civilization kicked us in the face” by reading “coups de gueule” as a literal composite of <em>coups</em> (“blows”) and <em>gueule</em> (an informal word for “mouth, face”). However, “coup de gueule” is an idiom that means “roar, yell, rant, tirade,” so I translated this line as “with the rantings of civilization.” I translated <em>domestiqués</em> as “domesticated,” rather than its secondary meaning of “controlled, subjugated,” to show that the Christian missionaries who helped colonize Africa sought to erase traditional African culture and replace it with European culture under the guise of “domesticating” and allegedly improving Black people. Before Diop describes the physical violence of colonization, he condemns the cultural imperialism that supported it, which relied as much on “all the books” as on “machine guns.” He immediately dismisses the racist ideology that justified the spread of “civilization” as mere “rantings,” establishing the hopeful promise of the poem’s conclusion.
</p>
<p>
The Paternoster is the Lord’s Prayer, which Jesus used to teach his disciples how to pray just as Europeans forced Africans to follow their Christian practices. I translated <em>couvrait</em> as its more intense secondary meaning, “drowned out,” instead of the literal “covered,” to emphasize how missionary activities dismissed the brutal realities of slavery.
</p>
<p>
In the poem’s penultimate line, Diop traces how European colonial nations’ industrial production used raw materials taken from African colonies. By connecting the exploitation of Swaziland (now Eswatini, its indigenous pre-colonial name), a Southern African nation colonized by the British, to his own heritage in West Africa under French rule, he expresses the Négritude movement’s Pan-African solidarity and hope for global Black liberation.
</p>

David Diop was born to a Senegalese father (a cousin of poet and Senegalese president Léopold Sédar Senghor) and a Cameroonian mother in 1927 in Bordeaux, France. Throughout his life, he divided his time between West Africa and France. He was a radical voice of Négritude, a twentieth-century Francophone African and Caribbean literary movement that was partly inspired by the Harlem Renaissance and Black poets such as Langston Hughes. Négritude’s goal was to promote pride in a rich Black culture as a reaction against oppressive French colonial rule. Diop’s protest poetry is more militant than that of African poets like Senghor. His writings display the commitment to African liberation and revolt against colonialism found in Caribbean poets like Aimé Césaire. Diop contributed poems to <em>Présence Africaine</em> (<em>African Presence</em>), an influential Parisian political and literary magazine of the African diaspora. In 1956, he published his only book, <em>Coups de pilon</em> (<em>Pestle Blows</em>), which was translated into English, along with additional poems and prose pieces, as <em>Hammer Blows and Other Writings</em> in 1973. He died in a plane crash near Dakar, Senegal, in 1960, days before Senghor was elected the first president of the newly independent nation.

how much the humans setting up the bird nets
adore them
how can it comprehend that

This is my second time translating Zhang; (the first translation, “Grave News at Dawn, Great Tidings at Dusk,” can be found in the Spring 2020 <em>Doublespeak</em> issue). Over the past two years, I have accumulated more experience translating contemporary Chinese prose. As a result, I now find myself a little more comfortable with translating Zhang’s prose-like, conversational verse. The biggest challenges in this translation process concern flow and the clarification of conceptual ideas. The final line of the original poem evokes terms often used in Chinese communist propaganda — <span lang= ""zh"">光荣</span>, to evoke honor and glory, and <span lang= ""zh"">奋斗</span>, to evoke ceaseless hard work in pursuit of a brighter future. The poet, in referencing this sentiment, is being deliberately sardonic: just like the trees and flowers are ostensibly being destroyed out of love, the people are being guided towards grueling cog-in-the-machine lives that have no regard for their free will or well-being. There are few words with similar connotations in English — “honor,” “glory,” “hard work,” and “gallantry” are all more positive words in English. I chose the word “struggle” to reflect the hard work (with a wink towards Marxist uses of the term in English!) and “heroes” so that readers can (hopefully!) draw connections with similar English discourses and literary works on the hypocritical “celebration” of exploited and underappreciated groups (perhaps healthcare workers during COVID, or soldiers who marched during marching into World War I).

Zhang Ergun (lit. “Zhang second stick/rod”) is a Chinese poet from Shanxi province. Born in 1982 into a family of modest means, Zhang attended vocational school for a year after graduating middle school. Working as a member of a provincial geologic surveying team, Zhang spent decades of his life traveling to remote areas and living among impoverished individuals. His poems are known for their simplicity, sincerity, social criticism, and compassion for the powerless and the poor. He has published one collection of poems, 《<span lang= ""zh"">旷野</span>》(lit. <em>Open Wilderness</em>) and was honored with a Mao Dun Literary Newcomer Award in the late winter of 2021.
</p>
<p>
Critic and fellow poet Liu Nian (<span lang= ""zh"">刘年</span>) noted that Zhang’s poetry is representative of what he considers to be the “Chinese school” of contemporary Chinese poetry. According to Liu, the school – and Zhang’s works – follow the literary tradition of classical Chinese poetry while drawing inspiration from Western philosophy. Poems from the school feature simple prose, grounded realism, and compassion for all.

","<p>“Morituri,” published by Brand in his magazine <em>Der Eigene</em> in 1898, is a homoerotic poem wherein the narrator begs the sun to provide love, strength, and youth to his lover. This is consistent with the glorification of health and strength, especially of the nude body, found in illustrations throughout <em>Der Eigene</em>, including the one accompanying the original poem. Of note here is that Brand and his colleagues often described homosexuality as <em>Liebe zwischen Freunden</em>, or “love between friends,” so the romance is implicit even without the mention of “beloved.” Given Brand’s open hostility towards religion, it is also interesting that the poem has a prayer-like quality, which I hoped to preserve in the translation. </p>","<p>Adolf Brand (1874–1945) was a German gay activist and the founder of the first gay periodical, <em>Der Eigene</em> (1896–1932). He was also a founding member of Der Gemeinschaft der Eigenen (GdE), a literary society that viewed homosexuality as a basic human desire better expressed through art and literature than biology. As such, the GdE rejected Magnus Hirschfeld’s medical view of homosexuality, which associated it with femininity. GdE members fought unsuccessfully for the reform of Paragraph 175, which criminalized homosexuality in Germany. However, some of Brand’s more devastating views, including his support for pederasty, white supremacy, and misogyny, have rightfully caused the GdE to be discredited today. Beyond his literary activities, Brand was also known for outing prominent figures who expressed homophobic views, for which he was imprisoned at one point. Unfortunately, Brand was forced to abandon his activism in the 1930s due to harassment from Nazi authorities.</p>",<p>Robert Chen is a fourth-year at the University of Pennsylvania studying biochemistry and chemistry.</p>,German,de,/assets/images/images_22/Brand_Morituri.png,none,An illustration by Richard Grimm accompanying the original poem in <i>Der Eigene</i>.,,"<div>

kaise-kahoon-how-do-i-say,,<em>Kaise Kahoon</em> / How Do I Say?,Simran Chand,,,,"<p>As a heritage speaker, I can easily navigate nonchalant conversations about the usual suspects:  the frigid nature of gray Philadelphia winters, the heinous pile of chemistry homework that awaits me, the satisfying taste of my morning Metropolitan Bakery bagel, and the like. It is usually the pretentious, sophisticated words that elude me. Though reading and writing Hindi at a fourth-grade level and being conversationally fluent may seem like a masterful feat, I struggle to  maintain conversations with my own flesh and blood. I wish to discuss politics with my relatives;  I want to empathize with their emotions; I hope to understand their life histories. While my thoughts and abilities to express myself in English have grown from a liberal arts college education, my Hindi lags far…<em>far</em> behind. As my mind races ahead and the conversation continues forth, my lips are still floundering to summon seemingly simple words. My vocabulary  precludes me, and those opportunities to connect remain far out of reach. </p>
<p>Beyond seeking deeper connections through conversation, there is also the matter of discussion topics riddled with taboo. Communicating about uncomfortable subjects is difficult enough in one’s native tongue, so how does a second-generation Indian American girl who has just lost her virginity ask her mom about “emergency contraception”? How does a prepubescent Sikh boy discovering his sexuality question “masturbation” in Punjabi? If I struggle to remember the  Hindi translations for “government” or “calendar,” how can I possibly conjure a translation for  “intimacy” or “consent”? To this day, I have not heard anyone say the Hindi word for “sex.” Translations aside, do certain words even exist? What is “lesbian” or “orgasm” or “foreplay”? I  could not tell you, nor do I feel comfortable asking the people in my life who could perhaps enlighten me.</p>
<p>Delving into this notion further, what does this mean for the cultural phenomenon colloquially known as the “sex talk”? Parents brought up in the United States awkwardly struggle to teach their children about puberty and sex — or some abstain from it altogether and allow school systems to handle the task — but at least there is a shared language between parent and child that confers some level of openness to sexual communication channels. Even if it is not discussed, American television shows, films, books, and social media tell us about cherries popping and sixty-nining. These are words I can put to paper, and regardless of how squeamish they may make the reader, the concept is understood. How does a Muslim American girl tell her immigrant mother she had premarital sex and discovered she has a pelvic floor disorder requiring gynecologic therapy? How does a Tamil American boy still on his parents’ health insurance explain to them that he is gay and wishes to begin HIV prevention medication? There is perhaps an inherent timidness for a child to reveal their sexual activity to a parent that is only heightened when we add elements such as religious transgression, compulsory heterosexuality, culturally rooted stigmas, and a complete lack of language equivalency through which a child of immigrants might make their parents understand.</p>
<p>Let us extend this further to gender identity or sexual orientation. A young person struggling with their gender identity can attempt to put into words what they feel.  They can utilize vocabulary such as “queer,” “nonbinary,” or “transgender” to effectively communicate their non-heteronormative identity. What does a young South Asian American individual do? They do not have a cultural equivalent in their parents’ native tongue to help them understand this identity, let alone the verbiage to express it. There are other non-heteronormative identities native or known to South Asia, including <em>hijra</em> in Hinduism or <em>khuntha</em> in Islam, but what is queerness? Not only is there a lack of word equivalents, but also a lack of cultural equivalents. How does this person explicate to their South Asian-born parents what exactly they feel — who exactly they are?</p> 
<p>And yet, we cannot blame. There is no one and nothing to blame. There is only the simple fact that the key understandings in American culture communicated through English are distinct from understandings in South Asian culture that are communicated through Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Marathi, Telugu, and other languages and dialects in India, Pakistan and other regions. The messages are quite literally lost in translation. Unfortunately, the potential impacts of this are far-reaching and truly ominous. Initially, insufficient sexual education and closed communication channels can result in inexperience, discomfort, and confusion. Then perhaps experimentation and promiscuity for some, but repression and deep-rooted fear for others. What next? Lying, rebellion, broken family ties.  Insecurity, miscommunication, unmet desires. The ultimate manifestation involves a myriad of documented experiences with negative impacts to individuals’ sexual, mental, and physical well-being: lack of access to birth control, verbal abuse, struggles to receive the HPV vaccine, hidden sexual orientations, misinformation given to medical providers, and broken households.</p> 
<p>And somehow, it can all be traced back to not knowing how to even say “sex.”</p>

Simran Chand recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in December 2021, double-majoring in biology and Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies. She grew up speaking Hindi and English simultaneously, simply through exposure to her parents’ native tongue. She took Hindi grammar lessons through her early years of high school with Kishori Barman, a passionate resident of Newtown, Connecticut, committed to teaching the surrounding area’s  South Asian youth the beauty of the Hindi language. With a vested interest in ethnic identity,  gender/sexuality, and healthcare, Simran is the author of an honors research thesis documenting trends of familial sexual education amongst South Asian Americans at Penn. Simran plans to attend medical school while continuing to investigate the intersections of identity and medicine.

reaching-for-words-on-gottschee,,Reaching for Words: On Gottschee,Quinn Gruber,,,,"<p>In December 2017, my Onkel Helmut passed away at the age of eighty-four. He was stern, yet jovial, with a round and kind face. He, my Tante Resi, my sister, and I would often go on walks in the park in Queens and have simple lunches of hard-boiled eggs, ham, and bread. Occasionally, he taught me bits of German, like the slogan written on the thin yellow tag of a Steiff teddy bear: <em>Knopf im Ohr, “button in ear.” After the funeral, we all went somberly to eat together at a place called Gottscheer Hall. My mother told my sister and I that Onkel Helmut, like the rest of my father’s side of the family, was from a place called Gottschee. Sitting in the car, trying to wrap my head around the pronunciation of the name, I reevaluated my family’s history. My father always told us that our family was from Germany. Stray German words flit through our conversations, like <em>schlafen</em> (“to sleep”) and <em>Schatz</em> (an endearment, literally “treasure”). Yet, my Oma and Auntie’s immigration papers list Yugoslavia and Austria-Hungary as their countries of origin. I always felt that I lacked some crucial piece of information that would bring all these scattered bits of history and culture together — Gottschee was that keystone.</p>
<p>Pieces of my family’s story slowly came forward as I read about Gottschee’s history. Gottschee was a small region in present-day Kočevje, Slovenia, that Germanic farmers settled in the thirteenth century. Their language, Gottscheerisch, is a dialect of medieval German; Gottscheers, like my Onkel Helmut and my grandmother, could speak German, but a German speaker couldn’t understand Gottscheerisch. Gottscheers used German in business contexts and spoke Gottscheerisch at home, a linguistic island surrounded by Slovenian-speaking neighbors. This linguistic fluidity mirrors the confusion surrounding the Gottscheers’ identity, as clashing empires passed the county back and forth over the course of its history. Outside observers and Gottscheers themselves have identified Gottscheers as German, Austrian, Slavic, yet also as an entirely distinct people. I understand why my father never mentioned Gottschee — I don’t know how to talk about it without giving a history lesson. The most important part of this history begins in 1918, when Gottschee became a part of Yugoslavia after the fall of Austria-Hungary. Gottschee’s few colleges were closed, and Slovenian became the county’s only official language, although due to many children’s complete lack of understanding of Slovenian, public school instruction was eventually conducted half in German and half in Slovenian. Gottschee soon changed hands again, however, with much more severe consequences for its people.</p>
<p>Soon after the beginning of WWII, in 1941, Italy annexed the southern part of Yugoslavia, which included Gottschee. My Tante Berta Kropf, who lived in Gottschee during the annexation, wrote that the Gottscheers received an ultimatum that they either needed to assimilate into Italy or move to Germany. Propaganda promising prosperity in Nazi Germany, some of it spread by Gottscheer leaders, and the threat of cultural erasure forced nearly all the Gottscheers to comply. They soon found, however, that they were not relocated to Germany, but to Lower Styria (near the current border of Croatia), into the homes of Slovenians who were taken to Nazi labor camps. They left the farms they had cultivated for centuries to find themselves forced into often-cramped conditions with little land. I’m sure that part of why my father never mentioned Gottschee is the Gottscheers’s role, although unwilling, in Nazi Germany’s atrocities against Slavs. I sit and wonder how many Gottscheers genuinely believed in Hitler’s Pan-Germanism, and how many simply followed their relatives and neighbors or felt that they had no choice but to leave. Yet the Nazi Party also banned the use of Gottscheerisch, seeking to fully Germanize the Gottscheers and to erase their culture.</p>
<p>Their fragile living in Lower Styria was upended again at the end of WWII, when Nazi Germany was expelled from Yugoslavia. The Gottscheers had no right whatsoever to stay, but they were not allowed to return to their homes in Gottschee, as it became part of Yugoslavia. The Anti-Fascist Council for the Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ), led by Josip Broz Tito, held all ethnic Germans, including the Gottscheers, responsible for Nazi Germany’s crimes during the war. Gottscheerisch and German were banned permanently, replaced by Slovenian. In 1945, the Department for People’s Protection (OZNA) carried out a campaign to eradicate or evict ethnic Germans living in Yugoslavia. Thousands of Gottscheers and other ethnic Germans were held in the Sterntal concentration camp, located in present-day Kidričevo, Slovenia, where two to seven thousand people died. In addition, around eight to twelve thousand Gottscheers were stripped of their possessions and land and marched to Austria in August 1945. About three thousand people died on the march; those who survived were placed in overcrowded refugee camps in Austria. I wonder, too, what it must have felt like for the Gottscheers, most of whom wanted no affiliation with Germany whatsoever, to be forced to move, then to be treated brutally by the OZNA, only to be rejected as outsiders in Germany and Austria. Some Gottscheers remained in Gottschee — particularly those who had agreed to fight with the Yugoslavian partisans — some stayed in Austria, some went to Canada, but most immigrated to the United States. And even there, many Gottscheers were received with hostility; my grandmother, who was born in New York but spoke German as a first-generation Gottscheer American, was frequently called a Nazi by her classmates; meanwhile, her relatives were suffering because of Nazi Germany’s crimes.</p>
<p>As I continued reading about Gottschee, I discovered an old, spineless book entitled <em>Gottscheer Gedenkbuch</em> (<em>Gottscheer Memorial-Book</em>) tucked away in the back corner of my family’s office. Its light blue cover, embossed with the city seal of Gottschee, was held on by the oldest-looking masking tape I’ve ever seen. On the title page, it reads: “Herausgegeben un mit dem Reingewinne dieses Buches dem in Not befindlichen Gottscheer Folk zu helfen.” “Published to help the Gottscheer people in need with the book’s net profit.” Many Gottscheers immigrated to Brooklyn and Queens or the Midwest at the turn of the twentieth century and established a variety of Gottscheer cultural associations to preserve a sense of community in the States. These Gottscheers, as a part of the Gottscheer Relief Association, wrote and sold the memorial-book to raise funds for the Gottscheer refugees after WWII; my Tante Kropf writes gratefully of the clothing and food her family received. I don’t know which of my relatives purchased this book — my father didn’t even know we owned it — but I can find many of my relatives’ names in the lists of hundreds of Gottscheers who settled in the United States. Written in German and English, it comprises writings on Gottschee, information on the various Gottscheer organizations in the United States, and advertisements for Gottscheer businesses. I’m still struck by how much care was put into compiling the book, which included even people’s old house numbers back in Gottschee, so you might recognize a neighbor even if you forgot their name.</p>
<p>Even as it seeks to preserve Gottscheer history and culture, however, the <em>Gottscheer Memorial-Book</em> rings a sense of inevitable loss. In the words of John Kikel, a lawyer from Ridgewood, Queens, who led the Gottscheer Relief Association, Gottscheerisch “dies with the first generation.” The pressure to Americanize, to stop speaking your own language and celebrating your own culture, is difficult to resist, especially as new generations are born. But what happens to a language and a culture when a home country no longer exists to maintain it? When the Gottscheers immigrated to the States, they accepted that with the loss of their country came the loss of their language. My grandmother was the last person in my close family who spoke Gottscheerisch; she passed in April 2018, soon after my Onkel Helmut. I know that Americanization has significantly benefited my family. Whiteness, especially American whiteness, opens innumerable doors and protects me from facing opposition due to other facets of my identity. But I feel a deep grief when I think about the fate of Gottschee and Gottscheerisch. I had barely discovered my ancestry, only to find that my family’s language is nearly extinct. I still don’t know what to say to people when they ask me where my family is from. Do I explain? Do I call myself German, which is accurate and not at the same time? Is it even relevant to me, three generations removed from my great-grandparents who immigrated here? I remember once telling my Tante Resi that I wanted to learn German. She told me I didn’t have to, and though she didn’t say it, I heard the hidden meaning — you live in the United States. You only need English. Yet I feel like something’s missing; I reach for a language I need to speak but I will most likely never learn.</p>
<p>Gottscheer Hall shows that there’s still a Gottscheer community in the United States, but most estimate that only one hundred Gottscheerisch speakers are still alive. I know that I will never learn to speak Gottscheerisch, no matter how much I wish I could go back in time and cajole my grandmother into teaching me. But I can learn from what others have written and record my own family’s stories. It is most likely too late to save Gottscheerisch outside of books, but it might not be too late for us to record, listen to, and learn from speakers of other minority languages. Colonialism, the pressure of assimilation, the ease of communication through digital media, and the growing dominance of English and a select few other languages all threaten the extinction of at least half the world’s languages by 2100, according to UNESCO. Entire cultures and histories live inside every language. Organizations like Wikitongues, the Endangered Languages Project, and language schools established by Native/Indigenous peoples and other minority language speakers are doing crucial work to keep endangered languages alive. As people living in an increasingly interwoven world, we must do what we can to carry our own histories and languages forward and to reckon with the pain, but also the comfort and joy, that they bring. That’s how we stay alive.</p>

<p>(I gathered much of the history recounted above from the <em>Gottscheer Memorial-Book</em>, Tante Kropf’s account, “An Homage to the Quiet Heroes who were our Parents,” a 2015 Smithsonian article on Gottschee by Daniel Gross, and information on Gottschee from the Gottscheer Heritage and Genealogy Association and Gottscheer Hall. For a short overview of the Gottscheerisch language written in English, John Dyneley Prince, the ambassador to Yugoslavia at the time, wrote an article in 1931 called “The Gottschee Germans of Slovenia” that articulates many of the grammatical differences between Gottscheerisch and German. There are also many German-language resources on Gottschee available online.)</p>","<p>Quinn Gruber is a senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying English and Italian.

Вдруг нежданный приказ: ""Вперед!"" 
Снова рядом в сырой шинели 
Светлокосый солдат идет. 
 
2. 
С каждым днем становилось горше, 
Шли без митингов и знамен. 
В окруженье попал под Оршей 
Наш потрепанный батальон. 
 
Зинка нас повела в атаку, 
Мы пробились по черной ржи, 
По воронкам и буеракам, 
Через смертные рубежи. 
 
Мы не ждали посмертной славы, 
Мы хотели со славой жить. 
...Почему же в бинтах кровавых 
Светлокосый солдат лежит? 
 
Ее тело своей шинелью 
Укрывала я, зубы сжав.
Белорусские ветры пели 
О рязанских глухих садах. 
 
3. 
- Знаешь, Зинка, я против грусти, 
Но сегодня она не в счет. 
Где-то в яблочном захолустье 
Мама, мамка твоя живет. 
 
У меня есть друзья, любимый, 
У нее ты была одна. 
Пахнет в хате квашней и дымом, 
За порогом бурлит весна. 
 
И старушка в цветастом платье 
У иконы свечу зажгла. 
Я не знаю, как написать ей, 
Чтоб тебя она не ждала...

Bunking down near a splintered spruce tree        
Waiting, hoping for dawn to break,                         
It is warmer to lay together                              
On damp soil in a cold rain’s wake.                                
 
- You know, Julie, I’m not sentimental,                   
But no matter, I’ll say it still.                           
Back at home, in a house small and weathered, 
Lives my ma among fields freshly tilled. 
 
You have friends, a good man who loves you, 
She is all that I have in this world. 
Bread is baking, sweet smoke surrounds her 
Outside, spring is blossoming bold. 
 
Seems to her every sprig and tree branch 
Seeks her daughter’s return with a thrill. 
You know, Julie, I’m not sentimental, 
But no matter, I’ll say it still… 
 
We warmed up a little, just barely 
Then sudden orders: “Advance!” 
Again alongside me wearily 
Walks a soldier, her braids askance. 
 
2. 
Every day things became more bitter, 
We marched on without fanfare now 
Until near the Orsha perimeter  
Our battalion reached enemy grounds. 
 
Zinka led us into the battle, 
Breaking through fields of rye and wheat, 
Crossing marshes and ditches gladly 
Tempting death at each turn of fate. 
 
We weren’t fighting for posthumous glory, 
We fought, living our glory each day. 
…Why, wrapped in bloody bandages, 
Does this blonde-braided soldier lay? 
 
Clenching my jaw, I covered her  
With my overcoat, damp from the earth. 
Belarus’s cold winds were singing there 
Of her distant Ryazan home and hearth. 
 
3. 
- You know, Zinka, I’m not sentimental, 
But no matter, I‘ll say it still. 
In a faraway house small and weathered, 
Lives your ma among fields freshly tilled. 
 
I have friends, a good man who loves me, 
She had only you in this world. 
Bread is baking, sweet smoke surrounds her 
Outside, spring is blossoming bold. 
 
An old woman in flower-print housedress 
Lights a prayer candle, hope holding true. 
I don’t know how best to write her  
That she should not keep waiting for you … 
","<p>
As with any translation, I tried to stick as close to the original as I could. What does that mean? Two elements of Drunina’s poetry were immediately apparent to me: the rhythmic, marching quality of the stanzas, so resonantly underlying the meaning of the words themselves, and a plain-spokenness that belies its profound emotionality and intelligence. I could feel Drunina herself in the writing and worked to preserve these elements above all.
</p>
<p>
Besides staying true to the style, I had to balance the precision of the translation against the intangible imperative of conveying the feeling of the poem. So, while I went to painstaking lengths to translate verbatim, some phrases changed. For example, the phrase “яблочное захолустье,” which the poet coins to describe the location where Zinka’s mother lives, would translate literally to a somewhat nonsense “apple-ish backwoods” in English. To a Russophone, it evokes a sense of sweet, countryside nostalgia. What phrase would convey the sensation in English? I settled, after much debate, on the somewhat lexically removed “fields freshly tilled,” which also fit nicely with the rhythm and rhyme of the poem.
<p/>
<p>
<p/>
<p>
In another instance, “Пахнет в хате квашней и дымом” (“The house smells like levain and smoke”) became “Bread is baking, sweet smoke surrounds her.” I toyed with the more literal translation but, unlike <em>квашня</em>, which is a well-known term to the average Russian speaker, the English “levain” necessitates a dictionary for many (a well-read friend asked if I had mistyped “leaves”), and “sourdough starter” would wreck the poem’s precise rhythm. I settled on the version that best conveyed the plain-spoken power of the original. 
<p/>
<p>
<p/>
<p>
A detailed account of the decisions that went into each line of the translation could easily go on for another several pages, so I will simply wish you as enjoyable a time reading this poem as I had translating it.

I began translating this poem years ago, and it lived on the back burner until, early this winter, I decided to finally check off some projects from my personal to-do list. While the timing of the translation is entirely coincidental, given the poem’s topic and country of origin, it feels imprudent not to mention current events. Along with the rest of the world, including many Russian citizens, I have felt horrified at Russia’s unwarranted and unconscionable aggression in Ukraine. As “Zinka” reminds us, each life cut short is an immeasurable tragedy. I hope for a world in which peace prevails, civilians do not fear for their lives, and no mother must receive news of a child killed at war.

Veteran and poet Yulia (Julia) Drunina (1924-1991) began life in a Moscow communal apartment, the daughter of a teacher and a librarian. With the start of WWII, the teenage Drunina’s desperate attempts to participate in the war effort were eventually successful. She trained as a nurse and combat medic, saw three tours in combat and was severely injured twice, nearly dying when a shell fragment lodged itself millimeters from her carotid. Drunina was awarded the Order of the Red Star for her bravery.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards, she would go on to graduate from Moscow’s Maxim Gorky Literature Institute and rise to immense popularity as a poet. Anthologies of her work have been regularly published from the 1940s until the present day. Unsurprisingly, the scars of her war experience would forever figure heavily in her work, both in content and style. “Zinka,” the poet’s conversation with a fallen friend, touches on the unique situation of being a woman in combat and, most importantly, reminds us of the human toll of war.
<p/>
<p>
Honest, uncompromising, deeply emotional—much like the poet herself—Drunina’s poetry is in a class of its own. Despite her acclaim domestically, Drunina’s work is fairly unknown abroad.

And saw that fateful door closed. His Majesty read the missive upon it, proving it is the house of a musical maestro.
“That teacher who lives here, yet is now absent, plays his flute with sonorousness equal to his seriousness.”
Thus, His Majesty’s speech, full of passionate vigor, let slip his passion for the musical arts.
By way of reply, the younger prince shared a passion denied­—that he should deign to learn the art of war.
If only he could dance sveltely with his poleaxe, all foes would be at his fearless mercy.
The elder prince thought, it’s true, mastering these martial arts is a virtue unassailable.
While he longed for more vulgar things, as can be found in the musical arts, the old master’s song crept into his heart.
With a flute at his lips, he was transported away from his struggles as notions of manliness and womanliness faded into the musical void.
His longing to play turned into thoughts of delay, in consideration of what treasure he needed to pay to learn to make song.
The younger Sri Suwan, usually quite cunning, allowed himself an indelicate grin in answer to his elder brother.
My rings and glittering baubles have some worth, perhaps a thousand talent-weights of gold—
Perhaps enough to convince our teachers to accept other treasures, and accept us as students both.
As for me, older brother, I shall endeavor to learn my martial arts well to master my poleaxe professionally.
I pray, my dear elder brother, bide your time here in wait of your maestro.
When you’re finished, my artistic king and brother, I’ll come quickly to meet you here at your maestro’s place.
","<p>
<em>Phra Aphai Mani</em> is a 48,700-line epic poem written by the poet Sunthorn Phu between 1821 and 1845. The male protagonist of the poem is Phra Aphai Mani, a keen musician who plays the flute. Nineteenth-century Thai literature was often centered on male warrior figures known for their martial prowess. For example, <em>I-nao</em>, written during the early Rattanakosin Period, portrays the titular protagonist as an expert in the use of daggers. <em>Kraithong</em> by King Rama II is about a hero who kills crocodiles. <em>Khobut</em>, written by Sunthorn Phu during the reign of King Rama I, is about Kobut, the son of the Sun, who has special power to resurrect the dead. <em>Singha Krai Phop</em>, also written by Sunthorn Phu during the reign of King Rama II and III, is about a child raised by a giant demon who drinks milk from a lion during infancy.
</p>
<p>
Most of Thai literature during the early Rattanakosin Period—from the reign of King Rama to that of King Rama IV—was written by or for the monarchy. Therefore, the masculine stereotype was emphasized to glorify the King’s power. Male characters were usually heroes and warriors who protected their kingdom. <em>Phra Aphai Mani</em> is different. Originally, Sunthorn Phu wrote the poem due to financial issues, as he was imprisoned after injuring a high-ranking officer. He had the freedom to break such stereotypes. He depicted Phra Aphai Mani as a musician who does not have any superpowers or martial skills. He uses his musical mastery to charm and flirt with women. He is not a fighter and is rather sentimental. In fact, Phra Aphai Mani echoes the personality of Sunthorn Phu himself in many ways. For instance, Sunthorn Phu was famously known as an alcoholic who, when drunk, followed his feelings and passions rather than rationality. Sunthorn Phu was also an incorrigible flirt and had two wives and numerous lovers. In much the same way, Phra Aphai Mani has five wives.
</p>
<p>
As regards to the rhyme scheme, Phra Aphai Mani is written in Klon Suphap. Each line consists of seven to nine syllables. Each stanza has two lines and each line is divided into two clauses. There is a complex set of rhymes, and Sunthorn Phu’s signature scheme of internal rhyming adds complication to it. He rhymes the syllables within each clause as opposed to rhyming across clauses.
</p>","<p>
Sunthorn Phu (1786–1855), widely acclaimed as “Thailand’s Shakespeare,” lived during the Rattanakosin Period between the reigns of King Rama I and King Rama IV. He was famous for his epic poetry and memoirs. He invented “internal rhyming” — rhymes within each half-line in addition to the standard Klon Suphap rhyme scheme — which became his signature. In 1986, he was honored by UNESCO as a world poet, and Thai children study his poems to this day.
</p>
<p>
We decided to translate this poem because it challenges the male stereotype of warriorship. Sunthorn Phu rejects this stereotype by portraying the lead character, Phra Aphai Mani, as a keen musician instead of a great warrior. We would also like to raise awareness of the works of Thailand’s most celebrated author — Amazon currently has only one listing for Phu’s work. It is nonetheless challenging to transfer the beautiful rhymes of Thai into another language, and most of Sunthorn Phu’s works are lengthy.

It seems “The Whole of Spring” is against the poem’s speaker; something that is supposed to be full of life, full of new beginnings, is crushing her. It’s deceiving. One line I had trouble translating was “alentando afelpada” because I couldn’t find a suitable word I liked for <em>afelpada</em>, and it was difficult to maintain the musicality of both words in Spanish. I went with “cushioned fluttering,” because it produced the image I saw of a beautiful lush butterfly.  Every part of spring infiltrates her to her core. I love how quickly the poem turns, how quickly something so beautiful turns so ugly, and how quickly it buries itself deep within us.</p>","<p>Idea Vilariño (1920–2009) was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, where she lived all her life.

The two had a tumultuous, on-and-off relationship. Even though they were never married or officially together, she claimed that he was the greatest love of her life.

Luxury and beauty are but their scum
This woman was so beautiful
That she made me afraid","<p>Translating <em>1909</em> was an absolute treat; it gave me the opportunity to delve into turn-of-the-century Parisian fashions to determine the most fitting translations for words like <em>robe</em>, <em>ottoman</em>, <em>tunique</em>, and <em>Récamier</em>. While trying to reconstruct in my mind’s eye the beautiful dress described in the poem, I realized that the descriptions fit perfectly onto pictures of styles created by the legendary Parisian designer Paul Poiret. Considered the father of the modern runway, Poiret’s designs were in vogue during the early 1910s, and he was celebrated for his emancipatory styles, trading the corset for the sash. Looking at pictures of Poiret’s styles, I came across a picture of his chemise dress, which was a close match for the long silk gown with a tunic draped at the shoulders mentioned in the poem. For that reason, I chose to translate <em>tunique</em> as “chemise” instead of “tunic,” which seemed too facile a choice. I wanted the translation to most clearly evoke the image that Apollinaire had in mind, so I modernized the vocabulary (“coiffée à la Récamier” as “hair styled into a messy bun” and “ottoman violine” as “violet Turkish silk”) while maintaining the overall image as closely to the original as possible.</p>
<p>While some may choose to anglicize the syntax of the poem in translation, I think that there is a certain beauty of meter and rhythm that is lost in such a practice. For example, the line “Les yeux bleus les dents blanches et les lèvres très rouges” could be translated grammatically into English as: “The blue eyes, the white teeth, and the very red lips.” Although pre-positioning of adjectives is most common in English, post-positioning is also possible without greatly altering the meaning. Furthermore, the grammaticalization of the definite article <em>le</em>/<em>la</em>/<em>les</em> in French as a marker of grammatical gender means that in translation to English (which does not have a grammatical gender), it was unnecessary to maintain the definite article. To better flow from the previous line, I added the words “with” (to justify the link between her face and the French <em>tricolore</em>) and “her” (to emphasize the provenance of these patriotic features). The result: “With her eyes blue teeth white and lips so very red” actually flows much better in between the repeated line “She had a face colored like France.” Another line which gave me particular pause was “J’aimais j’aimais le peuple habile des machines.” In French, the imperfect tense (here <em>j’aimais</em>) is inflected through just one word, whereas in English there are three possibilities, usually requiring auxiliary verbs: “I used to love” or “I was loving” or (in a few special cases) “I loved.” However, given Apollinaire’s repetition of the verb, in an almost breathless, stuttering manner, it seemed too verbose to repeat out the entire verbal phrase “I used to love” twice in the same line. Such a repetition would completely efface the uncertainty of Apollinaire’s original. Therefore, I went with a combination of two different verbal aspects: “I loved” and “I used to love.” The result is a more gradual unfolding of the narrator’s thoughts over time, while still retaining the breathlessness of the original. The lack of punctuation across the whole poem adds a level of autonomy to its words, wherein the words derive meaning from their interrelationships, not from the imposition of grammatical symbols (which might also function as a metaphor for the whole poem: a revitalized post-Industrial Revolution France ready to forge its path without the interference of foreign powers).</p>
<p>On the level of the poetic meaning, Apollinaire certainly drew from some easily recognizable tropes to construct his personification of France. The “little golden slippers” and “clock strik[ing] midnight” are clear references to Cinderella and the ephemerality of the riches adorning France during the Belle Époque. The terrific and otherworldly side of fantasy is conjured through his phrase <em>quartier énormes</em> – “outlandish districts.” In this stanza, one is unable to forget the despondence from which Cinderella arose and the vaunted position which she attained over the course of the story. Nonetheless, in writing this poem, Apollinaire was calling to attention the vanity of his country, its obsession with superficial beauty, and the allure of the riches derived from exploitation of machines and people. The beauty of the moment was captivating, but it was also terrifying. Little did Apollinaire know the extent to which the next few years would see the meltdown of humanity within the world he had come to know and love.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank my friends, Jennifer Ye Ji Cho and Younghoon Jeong, for being excellent extra pairs of eyes to look over my translation and providing honest and critical feedback.</p>

","<p>Guillaume Apollinaire (1880–1918) was a literary figure of huge import to French modernist movements. When discussing the beginnings of the <em>avant-garde</em>, Apollinaire’s legacy looms large; his impact on the bohemian persona is just as significant as his writings. An extremely prolific thinker and writer, Apollinaire published poetry, plays, art critiques, short stories, and novels, influencing a wide variety of modern art movements, most notably André Breton’s Surrealist movement. What is perhaps most surprising about Apollinaire is his outspoken distaste for the music being written by his contemporaries. In his <em>Chroniques d’art</em>, he draws a distinction between “modern and new” music, the former being exemplary while the latter the unfortunate consequence of mindless experimentation. Paradoxically, though he describes <em>musique nouvelle</em> (“new music”) as being “obscure, empty, bereft of life, immobile, and enslaved to aesthetics and beauty,” he (perhaps unwittingly) explores the musical idiom in his own poetry and recitation. The Penn libraries are in possession of an original phonograph recording of Apollinaire reciting one of his most famous poems, <em>Le Pont Mirabeau</em> (<em>Mirabeau Bridge</em>). In it, he follows an almost musical contour to his recitation of the poetry, adding vocal ornamentation to the prosody of the language at the end of each poetic line as he speaks into the recording machine. The poem’s intrinsic rhythm is itself strangely reminiscent of a river’s flow: a relentless move forward through the passage of time, punctuated by waves undulating back and forth. Even if Apollinaire disavowed music’s attachment to the aesthetic, it seems that his own poetry could not escape its pull. Apollinaire published his collected poems, <em>Alcools</em> (<em>Alcohols</em>), in 1913, before the outbreak of World War I and the end of the Belle Époque. In 1909, we see an Apollinaire reminiscing on the past, his current moment of relentless change, and uncertainty for what the future will bring.</p>","<p>Saagar Asnani (C’19) is a PhD student in musicology at the University of California, Berkeley. A medievalist, linguist, and poetry enthusiast, Saagar is fascinated by how music and language overlap, interact, and work together in myriad ways within our world. A scholar of fourteenth century French vocal music, he believes that by studying the soundscapes of the past we can learn more about the structures and dynamics of human communication and perception today. Most recently, he has taken up the study of Catalan and Korean.

","<p>Translating a poem from Turkish into English is a hard art, since the source language has wildly different grammar and syntax than the target language, and the poem loses the sounds and the multi-layered associations of its words in the source language. As the translator negotiates between the words, sounds, and pauses of the poem in two distinct languages, however, recreating a text in new clothes, the poem may gain a new force and musicality in its new outfit, in this case, English.</p>
<p>Translating Şirin Parkan’s poetry has been such a journey of mental bargaining for me. Her poetry rests on common Turkish words which she seems to reveal from a personal dictionary, with additional meanings that she herself has cultivated, impregnating them with a unique intensity.</p>
<p>Her style is deliberately fluid, with barely any punctuation. She often serves up pauses by line breaks, as if carrying her inner music and rhythm onto the page. She is breaking the standards and accessibility of everyday language to take us into her personal world as a mother, a daughter, a lover.</p>
<p>During translation, this was one of my major concerns: to transfer the alienness of her Turkish into the English language with the same effect. Hence in the poem titled “Mother,” despite the impulse to put an article in front of “oath,” “secret,” or “prettiness”, the words stand alone at the beginning of the lines – just like in Turkish. It is an intervention in English, from a Turkish source, that opens up the possibilities of language.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in translating the word “chest,” out of which the “oath” and “secret” come, the poem gains new resonance in English. In Turkish, the word signifies a chest of drawers or a box. But in English, the chest is also a body part, covering our hearts. In a highly personal poem about memories of family life and growing up, the word “chest” more than fits in, enriching the Turkish. A translator’s triumph, in fierce negotiation!</p>

","<p>Şirin Parkan, born in 1971, has been writing poetry since her early school years, and she has published four books of poetry over the past ten years. Parkan writes poetry alongside her day job as a medical doctor in Istanbul, Turkey, where she works and teaches at the university. She is also a trained actress and performs with the Studio Actors group led by one of Turkey’s leading figures in theater. Parkan has a twenty-year-old daughter, and she is also mother to a six-year-old cat.</p>
<p>As a poet, she has a dense, brooding style, strong in visual imagery, melody, and rhythm. The visual aspects in her poetry show influences both from painting and theater as colors and a photographic sensibility. Her poetry is rich with unconscious cues that would provide fertile ground for psychoanalytic interpretation.</p>
<p>In addition to her four books, Parkan’s poems have been published in leading literary journals throughout Turkey, along with interviews and reviews.</p>","<p>Emre Azizlerli, originally from Istanbul, has been living and working in the UK as a journalist for more than twenty years.

non fossimo io e tu 
chi saremmo esattamente e cosa 
direbbero di noi le mani, questi 
corpi. Saremmo  
lo stesso incastro? Potremmo, 
io e tu, riconoscerci tra mille, 
sarebbero dello stesso blu il cielo e 
le correnti, 
se io non fossi io e tu non fossi tu? 
Non lo so, ma che ci importa? In 
fondo 
io sono io e tu sei tu.


È per sempre 
l’eterna carezza 
luce, grattacieli 
come spighe di grano.  
Oggi non basta nulla  
le ali le stelle 
l’agosto di fuochi  
magnetici al cielo.


Non ti hanno visto 
che nelle foto a colori 
nelle storie 
che racconti modificate di volta in volta 
per non dimenticare. 
Ma avremmo detto tutto di te 
le stesse linee degli occhi 
la certezza di esistere.","If you and I 
weren’t you and I 
who’d we be exactly and what would
our hands say about us, these 
bodies. Would we be 
the same seam? Could we, 
you and I, recognize ourselves in a thousand, 
would the sky and streams be the  
same blue, 
if I weren’t I and you weren’t you?
I don’t know, and what is it to us? At 
heart 
I’m I and you’re you.


An unending caress
is forever 
light, skyscrapers 
like wheat stalks. 
Today nothing’s enough 
wings, stars,
an August of fires
magnetized skyward.


They haven’t seen you 
except in color photos 
in stories 
that change each time they’re told
so as not to forget. 
But we’d have articulated all of you 
the same lines near the eyes 
the certainty of existing.","<p>The second two of these three poems by Stella N’Djoku can be found in her debut collection <em>Il tempo di una cometa</em> (Edizioni Ensemble, 2019). The first poem forms part of the new book she is assembling.</p>
<p>N’Djoku’s modern elegies traverse cycles of intergenerational grief and rebirth. In these three texts, her poetic speakers question their relationships with other humans as well as with the ever-changing seasons of the natural and animal worlds. Here, flux and stasis, memory and forgetfulness, life and death, entwine.</p>
<p>Caresses can be eternal. Someone only seen in photographs can live on through being articulated. Our organs can be composed of shells and stars.</p>
<p>From my very first encounter with N’Djoku’s verse — in an anthology of poems responding to the pandemic (<em>Dal sottovuoto: poesie assetate d’aria</em>, Samuele Editore, April 2020) — I was enchanted. In interpreting her beautiful, elusive rhythm, I hope to match N’Djoku’s movements as closely as I can while accepting their ultimate untranslatability. It is inspiring to watch my English reach a place of such elegance through correspondence with N’Djoku’s words.</p>
<p>For me, each translation is an approximation, and I carve out many paths initially. I find it so difficult to then choose some above others. This is one of the reasons I engage in retranslations,  revisiting the same poems with different approaches over the years. I hope to retranslate these poems one day too.</p>","<p>Stella N’Djoku is a Swiss poet, journalist, and educator of Italian and Congolese heritage. Her poems are widely published in online literary journals and anthologies. <em>Il tempo di una cometa</em> (Ensemble, 2019) is her debut collection. Currently completing her PhD in philosophy, N’Djoku teaches secondary school students, organizes cultural events, and works with the Italian-language Swiss public broadcasting organization RSI and the Italian WebRadioGiardino.

While he is not as famous in America, I hope this is a step toward a growing fascinated audience. Because Arabic is a gendered language, it is clear that the speaker is a woman, a fact which gets lost in English. Because the word “passion” (<span lang=""ar"">الهوى</span>) and the speaker’s lover both use the same set of masculine pronouns, a reader of the original cannot properly identify to whom or to what the speaker is referring. In English, these two nouns use different pronouns (“it” and “he,” respectively), requiring the translator to decide when “passion” was the antecedent and when it was the lover. The original, like most modern poems in Arabic, uses ellipses heavily, which I don’t enjoy as much in an English poem; I opted for longer spaces instead.
</p>","<p>Nizar Qabbani (1923–1998) is a timeless Arab poet known for his sensual and romantic verse. A lawyer by training, he spent more than twenty years working as a diplomat. In addition to his two dozen volumes of poetry and his contributions to the Lebanese newspaper <em>Al Hayat</em>, his poetry has been sung in lyrics by Lebanese and Syrian vocalists, popularizing his work. People, young and old, in Lebanon — he lived in Beirut for a while — and Syria, his home country, sing along to these familiar tunes. Qabbani writes of romantic and political despair and advocates for Arab nationalism and social freedoms for women.
</p>","<p>Michael Karam (Penn C’17) is a translator, writer, and poet living and working in Brooklyn, New York. Michael grew up in Lebanon, between a small apple-growing village and a Beirut suburb. He is fluent in Arabic and French, knows some Spanish, and has recently taken up knitting. He currently works in marketing and fundraising for a non-profit news organization, The GroundTruth Project, which supports emerging journalists reporting on under-covered stories around the world.</p>",Arabic,ar,/assets/images/images_22/qabbani.jpg,none,photo by Michael Karam,,"<div>

Опять поминальный приблизился час.
Я вижу, я слышу, я чувствую вас:

И ту, что едва до окна довели,
И ту, что родимой не топчет земли,

И ту, что, красивой тряхнув головой,
Сказала: «Сюда прихожу, как домой».

Хотелось бы всех поименно назвать,
Да отняли список, и негде узнать.

Для них соткала я широкий покров
Из бедных, у них же подслушанных слов.

О них вспоминаю всегда и везде,
О них не забуду и в новой беде,

И если зажмут мой измученный рот,
Которым кричит стомильонный народ,

Пусть так же они поминают меня
В канун моего поминального дня.

А если когда-нибудь в этой стране
Воздвигнуть задумают памятник мне,

Согласье на это даю торжество,
Но только с условьем — не ставить его

Ни около моря, где я родилась:
Последняя с морем разорвана связь,

Ни в царском саду у заветного пня,
Где тень безутешная ищет меня,

А здесь, где стояла я триста часов
И где для меня не открыли засов.

Затем, что и в смерти блаженной боюсь
Забыть громыхание черных марусь,

Забыть, как постылая хлопала дверь
И выла старуха, как раненый зверь.

И пусть с неподвижных и бронзовых век,
Как слезы, струится подтаявший снег,

И голубь тюремный пусть гулит вдали,
И тихо идут по Неве корабли.

Again, the time for remembrance draws near.
It’s you who I see, who I feel, who I hear:

Her, barely standing in that window alone,
And her, from her native lands long ago flown,

And her, having shaken her beautiful head,
Saying: “Here, like it’s home, is where I come instead.”

I would like to call them all out by name,
But the list’s been taken and no trace remains.

And for them I’ve woven a wide, wide shroud,
Made of the poor words well known by this crowd.

I’ll remember them always and in everything.
Despite tribulations that fate’s yet to bring.

If they’re to be clamped, my tormented lips,
That scream for the millions of souls on those lists,

Then let them remember me in this very sense,
On the eve of my day of remembrance.

In this country, if it were ever conceived
To raise up a statue in memory of me,

I’d lend agreement to this exultation.
Although, be it with just one stipulation —

Please not near the Black Sea where I was born,
My last bonds to the sea were long ago torn.

Nor by cherished stumps of Tsar’s Garden trees,
Where a desolate shadow searches for me,

But here, where I’ve stood for three hundred hours 
Where the doors remained closed, bolted shut with a glower.

Because, even in blissful death I would still fear
Forgetting Black Marias rumbling near,

Forgetting how odious side doors slammed close,
How an old woman’s scream like a maimed beast arose. 

And let through unmoving, bronze eyelids there flow
A trickle of tears, as of new-melted snow,

And let in the distance prison pigeons cry
And ships along the Neva gently go by.

March 1940

","<p>Epilogue II concludes Akhmatova’s <em>Requiem</em>, an elegy reflecting on the Great Terror (1936–1938). During this period, Stalin’s regime targeted ethnic minorities, those with ties to non-socialist countries, Soviet intelligentsia, and “anti-Soviet elements” (an intentionally broad term used to justify arrests). Millions of Soviet citizens were subjected to state violence. Written from Akhmatova’s perspective as she stood in lines with other women, waiting to see their loved ones in prison, <em>Requiem</em> memorializes the collective suffering of Soviet peoples during the Terror and immortalizes its victims and survivors.</p>
<p>In <em>Requiem</em>, Akhmatova implements imagery of state violence that plays large roles in historical memory surrounding the Great Terror. The names of those targeted by authorities were placed on lists, signed by the high-ranking Soviet officials in the state security apparatus, and led to the arrests and prosecution of millions of Soviet citizens. “Black Marias” refer to the cars used by NKVD raids, which happened with little to no notice and often at night.</p>
<p>This translation is the result of several hours spent poring over the same lines. Having mostly translated prose, I don’t usually pay as much attention to rhyme and meter, but I felt the need to do this poem justice in maintaining the AABB rhyme scheme and eleven-syllable meter. Akhmatova’s attention to rhyme and meter in her work allows for an emotional spiral in its recitation. This is particularly evident in Akhmatova’s recitations of <em>Requiem</em>, which are widely available online.</p>","<p>Anna Akhmatova was born in Odessa (in modern-day Ukraine) in 1889 to Russian and Ukrainian parents of noble descent. At a young age, Akhmatova moved to Tsarskoye Selo, a literary capital of the Russian world just outside of Saint Petersburg, where she studied at the village’s esteemed Lyceum. She began writing poetry when she was eleven years old. Her work was influenced by Aleksandr Pushkin, Nikolai Nekrasov, and the Symbolist Movement. After marrying her first husband Nikolai Gumilev, Akhmatova moved to Saint Petersburg in 1910, where she became involved in artists’ circles, meeting other poets like Osip Mandelstam and Marina Tsvetaeva. In poetry, Akhmatova was highly influential in the Acmeism Movement.</p>
<p>Following the formation of the USSR, her husband was executed for alleged conspiracy against the state. As the widow of an alleged anti-Bolshevik figure, it was hard for Akhmatova to find work outside of translation after Gumilev’s death. She started a relationship with Nikolai Punin following the death of her first husband, but Punin was sentenced to hard labor in a Gulag. Her son Lev Gumilev was also imprisoned on suspicion of his bourgeois and anti-Bolshevik heritage. Her work was censored by state authorities during the Stalinist period because of its “overly feminine” qualities and “bourgeois elements.”</p>
<p>Anna Akhmatova is one of the few poets of her time who was targeted by the state and lived to an old age, receiving more widespread recognition in the Krushchev period. She continues to inspire future generations of poets around the world.</p>","<p>Ryan Hardy is an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing a degree in Russian and Eastern European studies. Ryan has held various writing and editing positions for the School of Russian and Asian Studies, Pomona College’s <em>Vestnik</em>, and <em>Doublespeak Magazine</em>.

那时候我二十岁
是个疯子。
我失去了一个国家
却赢得了一个梦。
而只要有了那个梦
剩下的都无关紧要。
不用干活，不用祷告
也不用在清早念书
和浪漫主义狗一起。
而那个梦住在我灵魂的空洞中。

在阴影里，
在热带的一叶肺里。
而有时候我回到自己之中
去探访那个梦：一座化为永恒的雕像
泡在液态的思绪里，
一条白色的虫子
蠕动在爱里。
一种逃亡的爱。
一场梦中之梦。
而噩梦却告诉我：你会长大的。
你会把疼痛与迷宫的意象抛在身后
然后你会遗忘的。

and crazy.
I had lost a country
but gained a dream.
And as long as I had this dream,
nothing else mattered.
Neither work nor pray
Nor study at dawn 
together with the romantic dogs. 
And the dream lived in my spirit’s emptiness. 
A wooden room, 
in the shadows, 
in one of the lungs of the tropic.
And sometimes I return to within myself
and visit the dream: eternalized statue
in liquid thoughts,
a white worm writhing
in love.
A runaway love.
A dream within another dream.
And the nightmare told me: you’ll grow up.
You’ll leave behind the images of the pain and the labyrinth
and you’ll forget.
But at that time growing up would’ve been a crime.
I’m here, I said, together with the romantic dogs
and here I’ll stay.

<h1>Влюблённые псы</h1>
<h2>translated by Ryan Hardy and Daniel Shevchenko</h2>

Мне тогда стукнуло двадцать
И я был без ума. 
Я потерял страну
Но приобрёл мечту.
И пока у меня была эта мечта,
Ничто больше меня не касалось.
Ни работа, ни молитва,
Ни занятья на заре
Бок о бок со влюблёнными псами.
И эта мечта таилась в пустоте моего духа.
Деревянная комната,
В полутени,
В одном из тропических лёгких.
Иногда я укрывался сам в себе
И посещал эту мечту: изваяние увековеченное
В жидких размышлениях
И белый червь, извивающийся
От любви.
Необузданная любовь.
Мечта внутри мечты.
И подсказывал мне кошмар: ты вырастешь,
Оставишь позади картины лабиринта и боли
И забудешь.
Но вырасти тогда было бы преступлением.
Я здесь, сказал я, я со влюблёнными псами
и здесь я и останусь.
","<p>A problem faced by nearly all of our translators when translating the text was the difference between the degrees of formality of certain words (or even entire word forms, per the individual language’s grammar) and the relative informality of the original Spanish text. In general, we chose an informal approach to the translations; however, individual cases (such as <span lang= ""zh"">探访</span> for <em>visitaba el sueño</em> in the Chinese version, or <em>изваяние</em> as <em>estatua</em> in the Russian) are more formal, prioritizing connotational nuances and the overall melody of the work. The inclusion of the Spanish word <em>y</em> (“and”), which is used as a connector and as a particle expressing continuous flow of thought, was also a point of contention: while in most languages this word could be translated literally with roughly the same connotation, Japanese in particular lacks a sufficiently short and informal word to match the original, and it was instead conveyed through the usage of short verb tenses. The phrase <em>amor desbocado</em> also posed considerable difficulties, as it was necessary to convey the feelings of both “breaking away” and “becoming free” in translation; in the English version, this was translated as “runaway love”; in French and Russian, this love is <em>débridé</em> and <em>необузданная</em>, respectively (in both cases “unbridled”); in Chinese, the word <span lang= ""zh"">逃亡</span> was used to preserve the meaning of self-liberation while also remaining consonant with <span lang= ""zh"">脱缰的爱<span>. Most metaphors were translated literally.</p>","<p>Roberto Bolaño (1953–2003) was a Chilean writer and poet. He moved with his family to Mexico City when he was fifteen and actively participated in journalism and leftist movements after dropping out of school. He returned to Chile in 1973 to support the democratic socialist movement. After the government was overthrown by the right-wing Augusto Pinochet’s forces in a military coup, Bolaño was arrested but fortunately rescued by prison guards who were his former classmates. However, his presence in Chile during this period is contested.</p>","<p><em>DoubleSpeak</em>’s staff is a group of poetry lovers and language aficionados.
