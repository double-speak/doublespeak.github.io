Vêtue de ta couleur qui est vie, de ta forme qui est beauté!
J’ai grandi à ton ombre ; la douceur de tes mains bandait
mes yeux.
Et voilà qu’au coeur de l’Eté et de Midi, je te découvre,
Terre promise, du haut d’un haut col calciné
Et ta beauté me foudroie en plein coeur, comme l’éclair
d’un aigle.
Femme nue, femme obscure
Fruit mûr à la chair ferme, sombres extases du vin noir,
bouche qui fais lyrique ma bouche
Savane aux horizons purs, savane qui frémis aux caresses
ferventes du Vent d’Est
Tamtam sculpté, tamtam tendu qui grondes sous les doigts

Ta voix grave de contralto est le chant spirituel de l’Aimée.
Femme nue, femme obscure
Huile que ne ride nul souffle, huile calme aux flancs de
l’athlète, aux flancs des princes du Mali
Gazelle aux attaches célestes, les perles sont étoiles sur
la nuit de ta peau
Délices des jeux de l’esprit, les reflets de l’or rouge sur ta
peau qui se moire
A l’ombre de ta chevelure, s’éclaire mon angoisse aux
soleils prochains de tes yeux.

Wrapped in your color which is life, in your shape which is beauty
I grew up in your shadow; your hands covered my eyes gently
And now, at the height of summer and at midday, 
I find you, the Promised Land, at the summit of a high, scorched mountain pass
And as lightning strikes an eagle, your beauty strikes my heart. 

Bare Woman, Black Woman 

Ripe fruit with firm flesh, the dark rapture of black wine, lips that my mouth makes songs about
To the pure horizons of the Savannah, the Savannah that trembles with the reverent caresses of the East Wind
Sculpted rhythm, tense rhythm that rumbles under the fingers of the victorious
Your deep, contralto voice is the spiritual chant of the Loved 

Bare Woman, Black Woman

Oil that no breeze can ripple, oil that soothes the sides of an athlete and the sides of Mali’s princes. 

A gazelle with celestial ties, pearls are stars on the night of your skin
The sparkle of gold that consumes your iridescent skin, is a delight to the Soul
In the shadow of your hair, my anxieties are lightened by the sunlight coming from your eyes. 

Bare Woman, Black Woman

I sing of your passing beauty, a form that I fix among the Eternal
Before jealous fate reduces you to ashes that will nourish the roots of life. ","<p>This poem is deeply rooted in the principles of Négritude that Senghor helped establish in France in the 1930s. The idea of celebrating and finding pride in blackness is evident in the way this poem conceptualizes a “Black Woman” as an almost otherworldly being, one that demands respect for simply her way of existing. As American society today is at a crossroads in terms of representations of Black women in media and in literature, I decided to translate this poem as a way to bring attention to the way poetry discusses Black women and to the fact that Black women are often absent in mainstream poetry.</p>","<p>Léopald Sédar Senghor was born in Joal, Senegal in 1906 and died in 2001 in Verson, France. At the age of eight, Senghor began his studies at a Christian boarding school. He later went onto to attend seminary but decided to leave the religious life behind to attend a secular university. After he completed his Baccalaureate, he continued his studies in France where formed a group with other intellectuals from the African diaspora. This group would eventually begin the Négritude movement in response to the racism present in France. This movement became a strong foundation for the rest of his literary work. The majority of his poetry addresses his opinions on Blackness and the complex relationship between France and its former colonies. The idea of Négritude also served as the basis for his political thought as he later advocated for Senegal’s independence from France. After the separation, he became the first president of Senegal. When he took his leave from politics he retired to France to publish more poetry and he was inducted into the French Academy as their first African member. He remains well-known as one of the most important twentieth-century African intellectuals.</p>

here-i-love-you,Aquí te amo,Here I Love You,Pablo Neruda,Sam Friskey,"Here I love you. 
In the dark pines, the wind untangles its being.
The phosphorescent moon glows on the wandering waters. 
Identical days go chasing one another. 

The fog unravels itself into the figure of a dancer. 
A silver gull descends into sundown. 
Sometimes, a sail. Those far, far stars. 

Oh, the black cross of a ship. 
Alone.
Sometimes when I wake, even my soul is wet.
Sound, resound, the distant sea. 
This is a port.
Here I love you. 

Here I love you, here the horizon hides you in vain. 
Even among such coldness, I am loving you. 
Sometimes my kisses board those solemn boats
that cross the sea, running towards someplace they’ll never arrive.

Already, I see myself forgotten like those old anchors.
Sadder still are the piers when the afternoon docks there. 
My hungry existence grows weary. 
I love what I do not have. You are so distant.

My weariness wrestles with the slow twilights.
But night comes and begins to sing to me.
The moon spins its circular dream.

The grandest stars look at me with your eyes.
And as I love you, the pines in the wind want to sing
your name with their leaves of wire.","Aquí te amo. 
En los oscuros pinos se desenreda el viento. 
Fosforece la luna sobre las aguas errantes. 
Andan días iguales persiguiéndose. 

Se desciñe la niebla en danzantes figuras. 
Una gaviota de plata se descuelga del ocaso. 
A veces una vela. Altas, altas estrellas. 

O la cruz negra de un barco. 
Solo. 
A veces amanezco, y hasta mi alma está húmeda. 
Suena, resuena el mar lejano. 
Este es un puerto. 
Aquí te amo. 

Aquí te amo y en vano te oculta el horizonte. 
Te estoy amando aún entre estas frías cosas. 
A veces van mis besos en esos barcos graves, 
que corren por el mar hacia donde no llegan. 

Ya me veo olvidado como estas viejas anclas. 
Son más tristes los muelles cuando atraca la tarde. 
Se fatiga mi vida inútilmente hambrienta. 
Amo lo que no tengo. Estás tú tan distante. 

Mi hastío forcejea con los lentos crepúsculos. 
Pero la noche llega y comienza a cantarme. 
La luna hace girar su rodaje de sueño. 

Me miran con tus ojos las estrellas más grandes. 
Y como yo te amo, los pinos en el viento, quieren cantar tu nombre con sus hojas de alambre.","<p>When I was translating “Aquí te amo,” I was struck by the beautiful simplicity of reflexive verbs in Spanish. The second line, for example, features the verb <em>se desenreda</em>, which directly translates to “unravels itself.” As I translated, then, I wanted to subtly explore the idea of self within the context of a relationship. As the opening stanzas feature a handful of reflexive verbs, I began to ask myself: In relationships, what do we do to ourselves, and what do we do to others?</p>
<p>The primary challenge of translating this poem was preserving the romantic nature of the work, as the poem is, of course, a love poem written in a romance language. I tried to preserve alliteration wherever I could and add alliteration in other parts of the poem to make up for alliterations that failed to translate well.</p>","<p>Pablo Neruda, a Chilean poet and diplomat, is known for his command of romance and sensuality.

He died soon after, and it is believed that he was poisoned by the Pinochet regime.</p>","<p>Sam Friskey is an undergraduate at Penn who is majoring in English and earning a certificate in Hispanic studies.

where-does-such-tenderness-come-from,Откуда такая нежность?,Where Does Such Tenderness Come From?,Marina Tsvetaeva,Jianing Zhao,"<em>О. Э. Мандельштаму</em>

Откуда такая нежность?
Не первые — эти кудри
Разглаживаю, и губы
Знавала темней твоих.

Всходили и гасли звезды,
Откуда такая нежность?—
Всходили и гасли очи
У самых моих очей.

Еще не такие гимны
Я слушала ночью темной,
Венчаемая — о нежность!—
На самой груди певца.

Откуда такая нежность,
И что с нею делать, отрок
Лукавый, певец захожий,
С ресницами — нет длинней?","<em>to O. E. Mandelstam</em>

Where does such tenderness come from? 
Not the first ones — these curls 
that I’m untwirling, and I have known 
lips darker than yours. 

Stars rose and dimmed, 
Where does such tenderness come from? 
Eyes rose and dimmed — your eyes, 
Gazing into my own.

Not yet have I heard hymns like this, 
through the darkness — oh tenderness!
charmed, crowned on the chest 
of the singer’s, and rest.

Where does such tenderness come from? 
And what to do with it — you youthful, 
sauntering sly singer, have I known 
eyelashes longer than yours?
","<p>I used to believe that poetry is what’s lost during translations. Now that I’m carrying out a translation myself, I’m thinking about how to minimize the loss, what to lose, and what to gain in turn. I tried to stick to Tsvetaeva’s original syntax as much as possible although it’s often all over the place, a result of both the flexibility of Russian sentence structures and Tsvetaeva’s personal style. I supplied my own interpretations at places of ambiguity. For example, in the second stanza, Tsvetaeva didn’t specify whose eyes are “at my own” (literally) or “gazing into my own,” so I added “— your eyes” in the end of the third line, to keep the stylistic consistency with the first line (as Tsvetaeva did) and simultaneously distinguish it: while both stars and eyes “rose and dimmed,” I proposed that there is a difference between the vast vagueness of the stars and the specificity of the eyes that are the narrator’s concern. Another example is last two lines of the third stanza: literally translated, it would be “had a wedding in church — oh tenderness! — on the singer’s own chest.” Instead of resorting to the clumsy word “married,” I chose words that I thought captured the essence of the scene depicted while evoking the idea of a church wedding. I eventually settled on “charm,” “crown,” and “rest,” keeping in mind also the flow and rhythm of the stanza. Although Tsvetaeva didn’t employ a rhyme scheme, since this stanza is about a hymn, I decided to use some end rhyme and alliteration to render a sense of melody — one that’s a bit arbitrary and non-systematic (especially with the abruptness of the intrusion “oh tenderness!”), corresponding to the tonality of the hymn drifting through the dark night. I also framed the ending to resemble the ending of the first stanza, except that it turns from a declarative sentence to a question, which corresponds to the evolution of the narrator’s emotions throughout the poem — from trying to find a rational explanation for the unusual tenderness she feels towards him, to the realization of her complete infatuation despite all doubts and criticisms. The ending, therefore, is an exclamation masked by a question.</p>","<p>Marina Ivanovna Tsvetaeva (<span lang=”ru”>Марина Ивановна Цветаева</span>) was a Russian poet, born in Moscow, whose work is considered among the greatest in twentieth-century Russian literature. She lived through and wrote of the Russian Revolution of 1917. Her daughter died of the famine that followed the revolution, her husband was executed on espionage charges, and she committed suicide in 1941. Many of her poems (such as a famous one starting with “I’ve cut open my veins…”) handle rather heavy topics with daring linguistic experimentation, establishing her as a striking chronicler of her times and of the human condition in tragic circumstances. In this poem, however, we see another side of Tsvetaeva: she had a brief love affair with Osip Mandelstam, also a famous poet, when her husband was in the White Army. This poem was written in 1916 and dedicated to Mandelstam: here we can see her passion, her interest in temporality, and her emerging style of circular structure and unusual syntax.</p>","<p>Jianing Zhao is a sophomore at Princeton University majoring in comparative literature and minoring in archaeology, theater, and gender and sexuality studies.

con le pupille larghe,

Tonight, on the sheets, in the same shape,

","<p>I do not speak Italian, so this creating this translation was quite a trip! With the assistance of native speakers as well as Professor Silverman (who teaches a course on poetry translation at Penn), I was able to get a better feeling of the poem. In “Repose,” I focused on highlighting the intense physical sensations that Pozzi invokes in her version. In the line “– il cervello penetrato di rosso / traverso le palpebre chiuse –” Pozzi makes use of dashes to distinguish the sensation described from the rest of the piece. In my translation, I felt that, given the nature of the physicality of this line, it would be interesting to manifest this distinction in a more physical form. For this reason, I chose to indent the lines “brain interrupted by red / across eyes shut tight.”</p>
<p>“Tonight, on the sheets, in the same shape,” was perhaps the hardest part of the poem to translate, as I really loved the repetition of <em>s</em> sounds in Pozzi’s version. While I didn’t manage to find an equivalent for “tonight” that had a similar sound, I worked to maintain the <em>s</em> and <em>sh</em> sounds in the rest of the sentence.</p>
","<p>Antonia Pozzi was an Italian poet born in 1912 and died at the age of 26 in 1938. After her death her father collected poems and letters written by Pozzi and assembled them in a book which he heavily censored. Most notably, Pozzi’s father made efforts to exclude mentions of Pozzi’s longtime lover and former teacher. Newer publications and translations of her work have made efforts to reduce these “edits” and present a version which is more in line with Pozzi’s poems.</p>",,Italian,it,{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/images_18/pozzi.jpeg,,photo by Sara Casella,,,,2018,submission

Ces liens d’or, ceste bouche vermeille,
Pleine de lis, de roses, et d’œuilletz,
Et ces couraulx chastement vermeilletz,
Et ceste joue à l’Aurore pareille:
Ces mains, ce col, ce front, et ceste oreille,
Et de ce sein les boutons verdeletz,
Et de ces yeulx les astres jumeletz,
Qui font trembler les ames de merveille :
Feirent nicher Amour dedans mon sein,
Qui gros de germe avoit le ventre plein,
D’œufz non formez et de glaires nouvelles.
Et luy couvant (qui de mon cuœur jouit
Neuf mois entiers) en un jour m’eclouit
Mille amoureaux chargez de traits et d’aisles.

<h1>VII</h1>

Bien qu’à grand tort il te plaist d’allumer
Dedans mon cuœur, siege à ta seigneurie,
Non d’une amour, ainçois d’une furie
Le feu cruel pour mes os consumer,
L’aspre torment ne m’est point si amer,
Qu’il ne me plaise, et si n’ay pas envie
De me douloir : car je n’ayme ma vie
Si non d’autant qu’il te plaist de l’aimer.
Mais si les cieulx m’ont fait naistre, Ma dame,
Pour estre tien, ne genne plus mon ame,
Mais pren en gré ma ferme loyaulté.
Vault il pas mieulx en tirer du service,
Que par l’horreur d’un cruel sacrifice,
L’occire aux piedz de ta fiere beauté ?

<h1>VIII</h1>

Lors que mon œil pour t’œillader s’amuse,
Le tien habile à ses traits decocher,
Estrangement m’empierre en un rocher,
Comme au regard d’une horrible Meduse.
Moy donc rocher, si dextrement je n’use
L’outil des Seurs pour ta gloire esbaucher,
Qu’un seul Tuscan est digne de toucher.
Non le changé, mais le changeur accuse
Las qu’ay je dit ? Dans un roc emmuré,
En te blamant je ne suis asseuré,
Tant j’ay grand peur des flammes de ton ire,
Et que mon chef par le feu de tes yeux
Soit diffamé, comme les monts d’Epire
Sont diffamez par les flammes des cieulx.
","<h1>VI</h1>

These vermillion lips, these golden rings,
Full of lilies, roses, and carnations,
And corals of scarlet colorations,
And this cheek, Aurore’s own, to my mind brings:
These hands, this neck, this chest, this ear, these things,
From this bosom, a green button blazons,
And from these eyes, the heavens’ conjunctions,
That make tremble even the souls of kings:
Ensconced is the Love within my bosom,
Thou filled with seed, has a stomach buxom,
With eggs yet unformed and glairs newly made.
As it develops (my heart rejoices
Nine whole months) and in one day produces
A thousand lovers with wings and bolts staid.

<h1>VII</h1>

Although with great pain thou wish to ignite
Within my heart, the seat of thy power,
Not of love, more so that of a furor
The cruel fire, to my bones consume, so bright,
Sheer torment is not so bitter to bite,
That it displeases me and if it were
To sadden me: I love life, my flower,
Only as much as it serves thy delight.
But if the skies birthed me, I cajole,
To be yours, do not bother my poor soul,
Take confidence in my firm loyalty.
Is it not better to find in service,
Than by the horror of cruel sacrifice,
Sweet death at the feet of thy proud beauty?

<h1>VIII</h1>

My eye wanders and alights upon thee,
Given to such sudden movements, thine own,
Strangely imprisons me, as if in stone,
As Medusa’s horrid gaze upon me.
Thus become rock, I cannot play nimbly
The Muses’ lyre, to thy glory intone,
Played by Tuscans, worthy was he alone.
Not the changèd, the changer, proclaims she,
Alas, what have I said? Walled within rock,
I blame thee, but am not assured by talk,
Such is my great fear of flames of thine ire,
And that my name, by the fire in thine eyes
Be defamed. Epirus’s peaks, ever higher
Were defamèd by the flames in the skies.","<p>In French, there are two separate words for describing the rewriting of literature from one language to another. There is <em>traduction</em>, which is simply translating the meaning of a string of words from one language to another. One has the freedom to change the syntax, grammar, word choice, and even rhyme scheme in a <em>traduction</em>. The other word to describe such a process is <em>translation</em>, which means rewriting the work in another language while maintaining the original artistry, such as the rhyme scheme, the word choice, the rhythm, and flow. In essence, in a <em>translation</em>, one is writing poetry of one’s own, using the original as a baseline. In this case, I have chosen to do a <em>translation</em> of three sonnets from Pierre de Ronsard’s collection <em>Les Amours</em>. Written in <em>Moyen Français</em>, or Middle French, in the mid-sixteenth century, <em>Les Amours</em> is a collection of sonnets describing Ronsard’s love for a young woman named Cassandre. What Beatrice is to Dante, what Laure is to Petrarch, Cassandre is to Ronsard. He poured all his creative gifts into describing her virtues and beauty in these sonnets, a style of poem heavily influenced by Petrarch and Shakespeare before him. I chose these three sonnets to give a glimpse into Ronsard’s mastery of the genre. His succinct yet vague declarations of love tug at the heartstrings and depict love through a variety of lenses: physical, spiritual, and philosophical.</p>
<p>I attempted to keep with Ronsard’s original poetry by keeping the decasyllabic form throughout the three sonnets. Every line is ten syllables long and follows the same rhyme scheme as the original. The first two quatrains are ABBAABBA, the next couplet is always CC, and the final quatrain alternates between DEED and DEDE. Finally, I attempted to keep with the time period and used the informal, ancient form “thou” for any parallel usage in the original French. What strikes me the most about Ronsard’s creativity, is that it holds true for tales and clichés of <em>amour</em> even today, nearly five hundred years later.</p>","<p>Pierre de Ronsard was born in 1524 in a small village known as Couture-Sur-Loir, on the banks of the Loir River. Ronsard finished his education in Paris and quickly made a name for himself as a great poet. Growing up in Renaissance France, he started his career under Madeleine de France as a translator of classical works into vernacular languages. After her death, he found himself in Paris and slowly made acquaintances with several other up-and-coming poets and authors of the time, including Antoine de Baïf, Pontus de Tyard, Joachim du Bellay, and Étienne Jodelle, among others. This group came to be called <em>La Pléiade</em>, modeled after the Alexandrian Pleiad of ancient times. Ronsard was the founding member of the group, and has since been known as one of the greatest lyricists of French history. Today, <em>La Pléiade</em> forms an essential part of the French literary canon and is studied by French literature students of all levels.</p>","<p>Saagar Asnani is a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences at Penn studying biology, French, and music. He has always considered himself an avid Francophile at heart, and more recently a medievalist, concentrating much of his French studies on the Middle Ages and Renaissance, mostly in the realm of literature. Having spent a semester in Lyon studying the works of poets like Ronsard and Chrétien de Troyes, he wishes to make these masterpieces accessible to a wider audience and to translate more works from Middle and Old French into English. He plays viola in various groups across campus, including the Penn Symphony, and intends to go to medical school after finishing his undergraduate education.</p>

These changes, of course, don’t begin to touch what it’s like to live in a new language, to feel at times that you’ve once again become a child lost for words. I spend many of my afternoons in Nuremberg walking through the city’s parks. Trees have always helped me to feel at home, no matter where I’ve moved. There’s something reassuring about seeing tree branches in a new place and thinking, <em>Yes, they’re peaceful here, too</em>. I was disappointed to realize, though, that when I tried to describe the quiet of these parks in German, the language in which they’d grown, I fell short. So when I came across a collection of Paul Celan’s early works in the city library and saw how many poems he’d written about parks and meadows, I felt a rush of gratitude for his words. I find translation to be an act of coming closer to a poem. You engage with every word before carrying the whole into a new language. Translating Celan has brought me closer to his individual poems and the German language, but even more importantly, it’s reminded me that our thoughts and emotional relationships to this world are shared. The impressions that I had in English existed in German as well, already years before. And this is why I love translation. It challenges us to look beyond something artificial, such as language, and find kinship with other humans.</p>
<p>Translating from German to English always brings trouble when it comes to German definite articles and their cases, which simply don’t exist in English. Without definite articles to indicate accusative and nominative case, there’s less freedom to change the order of subject and object in an English sentence. For this reason, I’ve reordered words in certain lines but otherwise stayed quite close to the original.</p>","<p>Paul Celan was born in 1920 in Chernivsti, the capital of Bukovina, formerly northern Romania. Because Romania’s medical faculty was closed to him as a Jewish man, Celan began his first years of university study in France in 1938–1939. The Soviet Union occupied Bukovina in 1940, with Chernivtsi later coming under German occupation in 1941. Celan’s parents were sent to forced labor camps in June 1942; his father died some months later from typhus, and his mother was killed by an SS guard. Celan was sent to a forced labor battalion in northeast Romania from the summer of 1942 until early 1944. In 1945, Celan relocated to Bucharest, where he translated Russian into Romanian and published his first poems. Before moving to Paris in 1948, Celan lived in Vienna, his only residence with German as its exclusive vernacular language. His departure from Vienna was an attempt to leave behind his youth and its unbearable memories of war and his parents’ deaths. This geographic and emotional move is also manifested as a break between Celan’s early and later poetic works. Paul Celan died in Paris in April, 1970.</p>","<p>Michaela Kotziers received her BA in English literature with concentrations in creative writing and medieval studies from the University of Pennsylvania in 2017.

However, Cavafy is describing how best to shape a life that just does not seem to work out as planned: “try as much as you can / not to corrupt it…until it becomes like <span lang=""el"">μια ξένη φορτική</span>.” Though “a strange burden” also makes sense in English, the emphatic <span lang=""el"">μια</span> (“one,” “a)” and the intangibility of life suggest that <span lang=""el"">φορτική</span> carries the metaphorical weight of “duty” or “obligation.” A life that is not shaped as you would like becomes something unfamiliar — a burden, an obligation and duty.</p>","<p>Famed for poems such as “Ithaka,” “Waiting for the Barbarians,” and “The City,” Constantine Petrou Cavafy was a Greek poet who lived from April 29, 1863, to April 29, 1933. Cavafy lived most of his life in Alexandria, where he was born and where he died, though he spent several years abroad in Britain and Constantinople. While alive, Cavafy published his poems in newspapers, periodicals, and annuals, only generating collections of his work upon request. Representative of the cosmopolitan Greek diaspora, Cavafy’s works appeal to international audiences.

Letters have nourished me, but I know not what letters are. I have lived in books, but am no more studious thereby. I have devoured the Muses, and yet so far have not myself made progress.

<h1>Translated by Paull Franklin Baum</h1>
A moth ate words.     To me it seemed
a remarkable fate,     when I learned of the marvel,
that the worm had swallowed     the speech of a man,
a thief in the night,     a renowned saying
and its place itself.     Though he swallowed the word
the thieving stranger     was no whit the wiser.

<h1>Translated by Samantha Pious</h1>
To me it seemed a wondrous thing
a little moth went plundering
— as though a burglar in the night —
the words a lettered man did write.
Not only does it eat his speech
it even takes the place in which
the speech was given, going through
the parchment and the binding too,
devouring all the craft and art
of the scribe, who worked so hard
to scan the verse, to find the rhymes,
that you might be inclined to mind
the teachings crammed in every line.
If you want to read good books,
you ought to curse that beast, that crook,
that greedy moth who dares to scoff
the text, the heading, and the gloss!
Still, swallow though he may, he’s dumb
and won’t grow wiser by a crumb!
","<p>The Old English poem presented here is one of almost a hundred verse riddles preserved in a tenth-century manuscript known as the Exeter Book. Its modern-day editors, George Philip Krapp and Elliott Van Kirk Dobbie, titled it “Riddle 47” in the third volume of the <em>Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records</em> (1936). In <em>Sources and Analogues of Old English Poetry</em> (1976), Michael Allen and Daniel Calder trace its origins to a late–Classical Latin riddle by Symphosius (late fourth or early fifth century), which is available in Raymond Ohl’s edition and translation (1928).</p>

<p>The riddle’s answer (Latin <em>tinea</em>, Old English <em>moððe</em>, Modern English “book moth”) is obvious, but, as Patrick Murphy points out in <em>Unriddling the Exeter Riddles</em> (2005), it seems less important to get the solution right than to contemplate the paradox of an animal “devouring” words but not “ruminating” on them. Indeed, consuming without contemplating is more or less what the book moth does.</p>

<p>This translation began as a thought experiment for Old English Live, an annual celebration organized by Emily Steiner at the University of Pennsylvania where participants share creative reimaginings of Old English poetry. At Professor Steiner’s suggestion, I decided to translate an Old English riddle into Middle French, as though I were a fourteenth-century poet. I imagined myself as Eustache Deschamps or Oton de Granson stumbling on an undiscovered copy of the Exeter Book riddles in the royal library of King Charles V and wondering what language, let alone what form or genre, he was looking at. Perhaps he would have managed to locate a copy of the riddle in its original Latin and been able to decipher the Old English from there.</p>

<p>Of course, translation practices in the fourteenth century were very different from what they are today. Middle French narrative couplets tend to lend themselves to far more prolixity than Old English alliterative verse, and I’m afraid the poet may have allowed his feelings to run away with him. The French riddle is twenty lines — more than twice the length of its Old English source, to say nothing of the Latin original!</p>

<p>Finally, I’ve added a relatively faithful Modern English translation of the “Middle French” version — except that, for better or worse, I embellished the English verse with far more internal rhymes than there are in the source text. Am I as flighty as the book moth? Or did I contemplate too much?</p>","<p>Symphosius was the author of a renowned collection of one hundred Latin riddles, entitled <em>Aenigmata</em>. The collection was most likely written in the late antique period. Many of the riddles, along with their solutions, have been transmitted.</p>","<p>Samantha Pious is a doctoral student in comparative literature at the University of Pennsylvania.

<p>To begin the translating process, I first produced a rough draft on my own, then compared it to the other translator Lily’s work. I anguished over “truly” versus “really” and “actually,” I anguished over the parallel structures in the original poem, I anguished over the long lines and over the use of time. The Chinese language’s employment of past and future tenses is quite ambiguous and I chose to value clarity over retaining the multitude of potential meanings. I owe my translation of line 14 (“the world turns and time goes on flying”) to Lily. The original Chinese has five characters (“world / change / time / move / location”) but Lily’s interpretation (“while the world is changing and time is flying”) reminded me of W. S. Merwin’s “Unknown Age” (“the bird lies still while the light goes on flying”), one of my favorite English-language poems, and gave me the inspiration to come up with my own translation of the line.</p>","<p>Li Jizong (<span lang=""zh"">李继宗</span>) is a middle-aged contemporary Hui Chinese poet.

Io sono una lampada ch’arda
            soave!
la lampada, forse, che guarda
pendendo alla fumida trave,
            la veglia che fila;

e ascolta novelle e ragioni
            da bocche
celate nell’ombra, ai cantoni,
là dietro le soffici rócche
            che albeggiano in fila:

ragioni, novelle, e saluti
d’amore, all’orecchio, confusi:
gli assidui bisbigli perduti
nel sibilo assiduo dei fusi;
le vecchie parole sentite
da presso con palpiti nuovi,
tra il sordo rimastico mite
            dei bovi:

II

la lampada, forse, che a cena
            raduna;
che sboccia sul bianco, e serena
su l’ampia tovaglia sta, luna
            su prato di neve;

e arride al giocondo convito;
            poi cenna,
d’un tratto, ad un piccolo dito,
là, nero tuttor della penna
            che corre e che beve:

ma lascia nell’ombra, alla mensa,
la madre, nel tempo ch’esplora
la figlia più grande che pensa
guardando il mio raggio d’aurora:
rapita nell’aurea mia fiamma
non sente lo sguardo tuo vano;
già fugge, è già, povera mamma,
            lontano!

            che oscilla
davanti una dolce Maria,
vivendo dell’umile stilla

raccolgo l’uguale tributo
            d’ulivo
da tutta la villa, e il saluto
del colle sassoso e del rivo
            sonante di canne:

e incende, il mio raggío, di sera,
tra l’ombra di mesta viola,
nel ciglio che prega e dispera,
la povera lagrima sola;
e muore, nei lucidi albori,
tremando, il mio pallido raggio,
tra cori di vergini e fiori
            di maggio:

nel mare dell’essere varca,

tombe profonde — con visi
scarniti di vecchi; tenaci

che piange, su garrula mensa,

mio casto all’errante che trita
notturno, piangendo nel cuore,

May the lamp of me shine
            and soothe!
this lamp as it looks
from a smoke-wrapped beam,
perhaps, at the night, the weavers;
this lamp culling news, thoughts,
            from mouths
darkened by the darkness,
there, across the soft cliffs’
            long dawning line:
thoughts, news, and love wishes, 
too soft to grasp:
the assiduous whispers lost
in the spindle’s assiduous hiss;
the words, worn out, felt
near, with such beat, new,
amid the oxen’s dull
            thudding chew:


II

the lamp that perhaps, gathers
            to dinner;
and blooms on the white, spreading
calm on the wide cloth, moon
on a meadow of snow,
            and smiles on the gathered smiles;
                        then suddenly gestures
to a finger so small
there, guiding the pen
that runs and drinks:
but leaves in the gloom, at the table,
the mother, who is still and stares
at her elder daughter, there, pensively
looking toward my sunrise,
rapt in my golden flame,
your stare is lost to her, far;
            she is gone already, poor mother,
                        far!

III

Perhaps I am the lamp,
            flickering
by a statue of Mary,
I live on one hundred shacks
feeding me humble oil drips:
I harvest this tribute of olive, all equal,
from the village, the greeting
of the rocky hill, of the creek
resounding with reeds:
at dusk my ray sets fire,
in the violets’ shadows so bleak,
to that poor, single tear
on eyelashes praying and despairing;
and dies in the crystal of dawn
my pale, quivering ray,
among virgins’ choirs and flowers
            of May:

IV

Or that, shaded,
            points
to the woman paler than the pale
sheet, dozing, whose womb
ripens your seed;
or illumines a bow
— the boat
which lifting the headlight of luck
crosses the wide stream of being,
and wobbles and groans —;
or silently glows
on deep tombs — on faces
older and gaunt; on firm
virgins’ smiles;
your mother! …in that timeless shade,
from her gloomy rest,
she prays for you, heart gnawed, hands tight
            on her chest

V

It shines, my lamp,
            it soothes!
in the loneliest, latest of hours,
in the shade, the gloomiest, the heaviest ,
the kindest, oh brother!
I hang over the pensive
young woman,
and the devout mother, over the crying
cradle, over the table so merry,
over the gravestone so grave;
from distances shines my chaste
flame to the wanderer roaming
the dark, with his heart so heavy,
on life’s moonlit trail:
he stops; then he sees my ray
that quietly burns in his soul:
he steps back on the darkest of paths,
            he sings as he strolls.
","<p>“Pascoli counts on a reader that does not know all the words he uses. As …[Pascoli]… says … poetry, like religion, needs ‘words that veil and darken their meaning, words, I mean, foreign to present use (and which are nevertheless used to “give greater life to thought”).’” — Giorgio Agamben (1982)</p>

<p>“Life is cold and we need heat; life is dark and we need light; we shall not let fade what can give us light and heat; a single spark can awake flames and joy. We shall not let death take whatever has been beautiful and gay.” — Giovanni Pascoli (1898)</p>

<p>This piece by Giovanni Pascoli is meant as a statement of intent, a manifesto of the intimist universalism which is the hallmark of the poet from Emilia. The poem’s protagonist is poetry personified, presenting itself in the form of a lamp spreading a warm, soothing light. This light, over the five stanzas, portrays a series of seven canvasses; the first three in great detail, the second three with quicker brushstrokes, and the last with a more abstract, rarefied touch.</p>

<p>At first, the lamp hangs almost unseen in the living room of a smoky farm. In the dim circle of light, a mother and her daughters are spending the early night weaving. The daughters are talking about love. Then, the lamp spreads its light on a table set for dinner, where a kid, the elder daughter, and the mother stand in isolation against the merry background. The light, though still soft, is more vital: it points to the kid, who is focused on writing; it captures the eyes of the elder daughter, who is there daydreaming and ignoring her mother’s inquisitive stare. Then, it is a votive lamp inside a Marian shrine, burning peasants’ offers of olive oil and witnessing these people’s faith, private and public — the “poor single tear” and the “virgins’ choirs.” Then it gets quicker: it is the lamp on the bedside table of a pregnant woman; it is the headlight of a ship crossing “the wide stream of being”; it is dead candles in a graveyard. Finally, there is no lamp, only light. This light is free from its many possible sources, and it can reach and comfort a wanderer roaming in “the loneliest, latest of hours.”</p>


<p>The poem portrays a coming to life, an actualization of poetry. It does so through a succession of van Gogh-like pictures, which I feel is more significant to the understanding of the poem than the actual stanzas’ structure. Indeed, the narration evolves through changing tenses and adverbs, which always coincide with changes in the landscape in which the poetic light spreads. The narrating voice starts introducing the smoky room with a wishful and timid tone — “May the lamp of me shine,” which renders the Italian “Io sono la lampada <em>ch’arda</em>”; then, switching to the table scene, the voice switches to a present tense and an adverb of probability — “perhaps…gathers”; adverbs of probability are dropped when the Marian shrine is populated by the villagers — “I harvest this tribute of olive…at dusk my ray sets fire”; this pure present is kept and stressed at the beginning of each of the three successive scenes — “It shines, my lamp / it soothes!’’ which renders the Italian “Io sono la lampada <em>ch’arde</em>” with the woman, the boat, and the graveyard; finally, the first stroke of the last canvas exclaims — “It shines, my lamp / it soothes!’’ which renders the Italian “Io sono la lampada <em>ch’arde</em> / soave!”</p>

<p>The decision to focus on the flow of images informed my choices in translation. In order not to break this flow, I often either adopted non-literal solutions, or I chose options more prosaic than the original. For example, “la veglia che fila” in the fourth verse describes weavers who are awake (keeping vigil) at night and spinning. These are encompassed by the lamp’s light, and the lamp looks at them, not at the night; though, directly introducing night and weavers allowed me to synthetically fix the image of the half-shaded room. Or, at the beginning of the shrine’s canvas, I was more explicit than the original in describing the “tribute of olive,” since the idea of an olive-oil lamp is quite remote to our present experience and the original passing mention would have complicated a passage which, to the best of my understanding, was not meant to be obscure. On the other hand, I tried to stay as close as possible to the original in matters of sound and structure, and I thus preserved the rhyme scheme at the end of each stanza.</p>

<p>I have always been driven to Pascoli’s work by his struggle to remember what’s gone, to strengthen what’s close and frail, to fight a battle to save “temples that the Gods shall not save” (Borges). I’m happy to present to you “Poesia” as a sample of how Pascoli framed this effort as a hopeful and humble task. Before doing so, I want to thank Professor Taije Silverman, who reviewed my early drafts, and whose advice has been incredibly insightful and helpful in the process of translation.</p>

","<h2>Interview conducted by Michaela Kotziers</h2>

<p><strong>Michaela Kotziers:</strong> I’d love to hear about how you came to translate Prado. I’m interested in whether you were on the hunt to translate Portuguese when you were in Brazil.</p>

<p><strong>Ellen Watson:</strong> As soon as I knew I was going to live there for a year, I knew I wanted to find a Brazilian poet to translate. When I looked in bookstores in the little provincial town I was living in, I found they had a glut of male poets, and they didn’t appeal to me. My husband was working at the state university, University of Santa Catarina, at the time. The English department had a little magazine in which students translated poems from Portuguese into English; the students were struggling to translate a short poem of Adélia’s. They didn’t know which idiom in English to use, but I saw the English (they didn’t even print the Portuguese, I don’t think) and I thought, <em>This woman has that spark that I’m looking for</em>. And no one, when I asked around at home, had heard of her. So I definitely thought I was on to something.</p>

<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> That’s part of the really important work of translation, too, is introducing a poet whom no one else has been able to read yet. Turning to this very personal relationship that the two of you have, I’m interested in the way that you two connect despite having very distinct ways of being poets in the world. Prado has expressed that she’s an author, but she doesn’t really have interest in inhabiting the role of writer in the professional and public sense. She doesn’t quite make a career day-to-day of her writing, and she said in a BBC radio interview that “There’s my normal life, and then there’s poetry.” And then, on the other hand, you are very much a professional writer. You direct the poetry center at Smith, you teach writing workshops, you’re the Poetry and Translation Editor at the <em>Massachusetts Review</em>.  I’m wondering how this professional side affects your process of writing and if, when trying to understand where Prado’s coming from, if that ever felt like something that needed to be worked out.</p>
<p><strong>Watson:</strong> No, not really. We have an incredible bond, and there are certain similarities in our fervor for different things. She is the spiritual person. I am not that spiritual. I mean, my first book was called <em>We Live in Bodies</em>, so that’s another reason that I gravitated towards her work: that it had the spiritual side but is so dedicated to and full of the body and daily life. For me, the struggle is more one of time. There’s never enough time in the week and the day and in anything to do editing and translating and my own writing. I guess I’ll just say that at a point when I was translating novels, I had to quit translating and not do any translating for a number of years in order to get my first book written. And people said, “Oh, you must be done translating.” And I said, “No, I’m a translator by heart. I’ve gotten that far into it. But I just have to find a way to make space to also write my own poems.” And I guess I’m a little bit of a workaholic in the way that I love the work that I do. When we’re in Divinopolis together, when we’re not working, she expects me to just go take walks, relax, and she’s like, “Why are you still working?” And I say, “Well, I’m preparing for our next session.” She kind of feels sorry for me, but I’m excited about this! So in those ways we’re different.</p>

<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> I’d like to request you to read “Where a Bird Is Also Nesting.” It’s from your book <em>Dogged Hearts</em>. It’s a poem that I felt really captured your relationship with Adélia Prado. 

<p><strong>Watson:</strong> And it really did start with this pineapple. [<em>Reads poem aloud.</em>]</p>

<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> The last line is still my favorite.</p>

<p><strong>Watson:</strong> I tear up when I say it. I mean, it’s true I am lucky to have these people in my life.</p>

<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> I’m wondering if we could talk a bit more about the process of your collaboration with Prado, in those sessions when you sat down at the table and you wrote with her because she doesn’t speak English. Could you talk about explaining your translations to her once they were written?</p>

<p><strong>Watson:</strong> Well, I sort of paraphrased into Portuguese what I had on the page. After a while, when we both trusted each other and I trusted what I knew and knew what I didn’t, it was more of a matter of opening a book to a certain poem and me having my questions ready. There were times when there are references to Biblical moments and although I grew up with the Bible, it was a Protestant upbringing and I don’t remember it all that well, and so she would go to great lengths to bring out the Bible and show me what’s in it and the verse. We just sit there, and sometimes we get distracted and wander off somewhere else in our talking, and then I would say, “Ok, the next question is…” There was a time in her life when she kind of lost her faith for a while. She was clinically depressed and felt like her belief had somehow gotten frail, and she didn’t write for a number of years. She’s such a fervent believer that doubt wasn’t something that she could really accept. There are poems that refer to that, and we always talk about how much to reveal.</p>
<strong>Kotziers:</strong> I can imagine that having known her poems so deeply and in a way that any other reader, without having spoken to her, wouldn’t quite know them, it would be difficult not to let that wander into your mind while you were translating and let it show too much, maybe even in ways that she hadn’t.</p>

<p><strong>Watson:</strong> Exactly. I didn’t want the poem to reveal more than she put in the poem. Whether she’d want that or not, it really should have been loyal to the poem.</p>

<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> There’s a compromise in the process of choosing what to keep and what to omit. Not just on a line-by-line, stanza-by-stanza level, but also having to choose which poems from her volumes to publish in English. Could you speak to that process of deciding which poems to keep in?</p>

<p><strong>Watson:</strong> Sometimes it was about poems just having a problem that makes it hard for them to work in English. For the things that get left behind, it was usually because they’re weaker poems. Occasionally she’d ask me, “Why didn’t you include this poem?” and I’d say, especially when it’s religious content, is that she is known for and unique in her ability to put not just the body and religion in the same book or poem — sex and belief — but for a counterbalance, a conflict. And some of her poems are just written in a moment of hallelujah, when she’s praising God, and it’s more likely they could be in a collection. But when they didn’t have images within them, when they didn’t have the daily in them, and then they ended with “Amen, Amen, Hallelujah,” I had a harder time putting them in with these other poems that were so much more substantial. I said to her that it’s that they’re less complicated. When I’m reading student poems or looking at my own poems or looking at peers’ poems, I’m looking for complexity. I’m looking for layers. When I’m putting a book together, I try to pick out what I think are the richest Adélia Prado poems.</p>


<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> I have some questions that are more specific to translation. Prado has said that what you must translate is the emotion. She has said, “I don’t care about the word.” I’m wondering how you reconcile such a liberal statement with the translator’s impulse to be more conservative or to meticulously consider every word and how it relates to the whole.</p>

<p><strong>Watson:</strong> I think we make blanket statements to make a point, but I think what that really means is don’t put the word above the emotion. The words are still important. But because she’s not a veiled poet, if I don’t understand something, it’s my lack of cultural context or Portuguese faltering, and that’s sort of the easy part of the fix. Overall my goals in translating her were to create the same sort of energy and accessibility in her work. I think of her poems as inviting and also disconcerting, because they are very open-armed. I think that she’s very inventive in the way the poems move, and I want to keep that level of surprise and spontaneity, because they feel like they’re just happening as you read them, and that’s exactly what they are. She’s so genuine. She says things and she takes them back, but you know that she means them both.</p>

<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> I’m wondering if I could ask you to read another poem, while we’re on the topic of choosing the right word. This one is called “The Birth of the Poem.” It’s in <em>Ex-Voto</em>, originally from Prado’s <em>O Pelicano</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Watson:</strong> [<em>Reads poem aloud.</em>] I like how she has it both ways. “Words stand for things. Things stand for nothing. Understanding comes like rapture. It’s the same as not understanding.”</p>

<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> I especially love the last line: “I didn’t build the pyramids. I am God,” as if we’re not building things; we’re just building poems and words.</p>

<p><strong>Watson:</strong> She says that poetry is the most human kind of communication. So although there’s the God side of it, there’s the human side of it. It’s the body. Poetry is the most human.</p>

<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> Just reading her poetry you can see her spirituality, and she finds God in things, in every day. She’s not searching for it in churches and buildings. She’s just writing at a kitchen table.</p>
<p>In another interview, you asked Prado if she thought metaphor was the guardian of reality, and if so, if translation could then be the guardian of metaphor. Could you elaborate on what you mean by “translation as guardian of metaphor”?</p> 

<p><strong>Watson:</strong> It’s like the business of saying I might have to change the image or metaphor to reflect more of the reality. So it’s the responsibility of what metaphor you choose. Maybe I’m interpreting it right now just in terms of translation and there’s a broader way of understanding it.</p>

<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> That makes sense to me, though, in terms of translation too.</p>

<p><strong>Watson:</strong> It’s so funny because we don’t think about the fact that the news cycle uses it. “Boots on the ground,” for example. I’m so sick of that. It dehumanizes boots. It’s people in those boots who are going to die. They don’t just say, “the troops.” We think in metaphors, but I think that’s not being the guardian of reality to say, “Boots on the ground.” That’s denying reality.</p>

<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> That’s almost doing a disservice to the kind of work that metaphor could be doing.</p>

<p><strong>Watson:</strong>  It’s not the most human form of communication that metaphor should be doing. It sounds catchy. And once it started happening, everyone now says that phrase and so many others like it.</p>

<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> I’m wondering, for translation to be the guardian of metaphor, do you feel like this means realizing that there are metaphors in every language? Is it preserving that this is a powerful thing we do in the way we think as humans?</p>

<p><strong>Watson:</strong> In a way, it’s that you are a guardian, so you need to take it seriously. It’s the commonality, that it happens in both languages, but you have to be creative in order to preserve it. I think translation is not an intellectual act. I think it’s an act of poem-making, in which the metaphor is supreme.</p>","<p>Adélia Prado was born and has lived all her life in the provincial, industrial city of Divinópolis, Minas Gerais, Brazil.

<h3>Starting From the Title: Translating a Captured Ruler and His Captivating <em>Ci</em></h3>

<p>The title of this poem has me stuck — not a good sign. Someone once said, “well begun is half done,” and I may have just jeopardized my shortcut.</p>

<p>This title (“Yü Mei Ren”) can be rendered as “Fair Lady Yü” but this lady is not related to the poet, Li Yu. In fact, the title is irrelevant to the content of the poem — specifically, of the <em>ci</em>.</p>

<p>As a traditional form of Chinese poetry, <em>ci</em> typically has a title that indicates the “set pattern” of the poem, which dictates the number of characters in each line, as well as their rhymes and tones (explained below). These set patterns initially evolved from lyrics of certain tunes, thus the restrictions, though the tunes themselves were lost in time. This particular tune is said to be written first for Xiang Yü’s (项羽, 232–202 BC) concubine, Yü (虞姬) (this is the Yü used in the title). Xiang Yü was a heroic leader of great nobility and virility, who led revolutions that overthrew the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC). Later, however, he suffered a tragic military defeat and committed suicide. Xiang foresaw this failure, and thus bid a final farewell to his beloved beautiful concubine, Yü, before going to the battlefield. The love and grief between Xiang and Yü, intertwined with the fate of a regime and the tragic heroism, are well known to native readers. In analyzing a <em>ci</em>, people typically attach no importance to the background of the title, because the set pattern can be used for a variety of unrelated themes, and the origin of some tunes can be obscure. Still, it would be fun to speculate whether Li Yu chose this set pattern with a little dark humor, about which readers may form their own judgment after reading the poet’s biography and the translation.</p>

<p>But I hesitate to present such extraneous information before the reader gets to the content of the ci itself. On the other hand, if the translation of content is captivating, maybe the reader will seek out this information, and more.</p>

<h3>Sound</h3> 
<p>The tones, which are strict, melodious, and crucial to the original poem, are not present in English — and in my opinion, impossible to render faithfully. There are four tones in Chinese, and most Chinese characters have only one of the four (some can have more than one tone, and people need to choose the most appropriate according to the context, e.g. the particular phrase a character is used in). In poetry, these four tones are divided into two categories, which we may call “even” and “oblique.” For every set pattern of Chinese poem, it is predetermined whether each character should be even or oblique. The tones therefore strongly limit the author’s choice of words. They, however, create a certain melody when one recites the <em>ci</em> in words. There are times I would try to recite a <em>ci</em>, but the words would get stuck on the tip of my tongue; I simply could not remember them. Yet the tones would still come to me spontaneously, and humming them was exhilarating. These were frustrating experiences, but they might speak to the significance of tones in appreciating a <em>ci</em>. On the other hand, studies show that humans selectively develop sensitivity to phonemes they are exposed to in the first twelve months after birth, and gradually lose the sensitivity to other phonemes (one reason why learning a second language can be so difficult, or why certain racial pejoratives were formed). While tones are different from phonemes, one’s attunement to and appreciation of tones likely rest on significant early exposure to them.</p>

<p>Rhyme is another aspect that requires consideration in terms of the sound of <em>ci</em>. The rhyme scheme of “Yü Mei Ren” is in couplets, if you will, though the original probably did not have the format presented above, with line breaks and punctuations. Therefore I hesitate to use words like “verse” or “stanza,” for fear of unfaithfulness and of creating an illusion that non-English poetry maps perfectly onto English poetry. It may be important to note that the standard of rhyme also works slightly differently. In English, the full vowel and the ending consonant, if there is one, must match. Only the ending consonant, or vowel, matters in Chinese. In this poem, for example, <em>feng</em> and <em>zhong</em> rhyme because of the ending consonant <em>ng</em>, while <em>chou</em> and <em>liu</em> rhyme because of the ending vowel <em>u</em>. The conceptual and nomenclative mismatch goes even further. In fact, the word “poetry” itself creates ambiguities in indistinctively referring to <em>shi</em>, <em>ci</em>, and <em>qu</em>, three different genres of classical Chinese poetry.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3> 
<p>Classical Chinese is strange. Classical Chinese is beautiful. It has a great succinctness and vividness, both of which entice one to explore further. It is mesmerizing yet almost impossible to find an equivalent in English. Ezra Pound interestingly noted that one should use a proportionally antiquated language in translation, meaning that one should identify in the development of the target language a historical stage similar to that of the original language. While this notion sounds appealing at first, serious consideration reveals that it is impractical to compare the development of one language to that of another. What we take for granted today as modern Chinese originates from drastic social changes in China in the  early twentieth century, as a tool of breaking free from obsolete traditions and revolutionizing people’s ideologies. Before that, classical Chinese had various forms and levels of sophistication — even Li’s own poems before and after his capture show distinctive changes in vocabulary. Therefore, the issue is more complicated than choosing a linguistic period, as there can be significant variations in a period itself, and the wiggle room just gets smaller (for the interested reader, I highly recommend a translation by Jone A. Turner, S.J., who had a similar notion to Pound’s, and partially succeeded). Other than feasibility, is it fair to create either a pseudo-archaic or modern rendition of the original, and to let readers assume its authenticity? Here, I was initially fascinated by the idea of Vladimir Nabokov, who proposed that translations should be absolutely literary, with extensive footnotes that explain every feature of the original that was lost in translation. After I translated the poem that way, however, the fascination ceased — the extensive footnotes, like “skyscrapers” on the page, were pompous and intrusive; it was difficult to draw the line between conveying versus interpreting features; and most importantly, the process was like sloppily dissecting a poem and laying out the valuable parts for auction. Whatever remaining liveliness in the poem was gone once I announced my translation as “complete.” As a result, I decided to include a word-for-word translation for anyone who wants a glimpse of the original and removed all footnotes, except one.</p>

<h3>Confession</h3>
<p>The above is mostly my extended justification (and self-exoneration) for choosing not to preserve the form of the original, as I found no satisfying way to do so. Of course, my judgment was partly clouded by my affection for the original, which I learned to recite from a young age and which represents a dense and riveting cultural history to me. It was my deliberate choice to write the translation as a third-person narrative, since it allowed me to integrate the historical background into the translation rather than provide a separate and dry footnote that broke the reader’s immersion in the story. The specific plot with guards and a dream, however, was arbitrary — I scribbled down the scene immediately after it came into my head during a relaxing hot shower. I hope this turns out to be an accessible and enjoyable translation.</p>
 
<p>Well, at least I managed to get away without a title.</p>
","Word-for-word Translation:

Spring flowers, autumn moon, when will end?
Foregone things, know much or little.
Last night, again, east wind in small pavilion,
Former country, in bright moonlight, bears not turning head back on. 

Carved railings, jade stairs, should still exist,
Only those crimson faces* have changed.
Ask thee can have how much sorrow,
Just like a river of spring tide eastward flow. 

*Literally translated from the original, “crimson faces” (<span lang=""zh"">朱顏</span>) is a variation of “red faces,” (<span lang=""zh"">紅顏</span>) possibly as a result of the poet’s effort to fit the tone of set pattern. “Red faces” is a common phrase to refer to beautiful young girls in classical Chinese and does not suggest embarrassment or exertion. 

<h1>Translation:</h1>

<p>Li Yü, dressed in a coarse, gray robe, was in a plain room with bare wooden furniture. The windows, carved with shapes of flowers, clattered in the wind. Li stood up to open the window and looked out at the fresh green leaves and budding flowers in the yard. He stared at them for a moment without any expression of joy or sorrow, turned, and sat back down beside a low table, leaving the windows open. Against the closed doors, he could see shadows of two armed guards. “They are to protect the safety of your Highness,” he remembered being told when he surrendered his kingdom to the army just outside the city walls. “At least no more innocent people in the capital will die because of me,” he thought. “Ah, it’s the third year now.”</p>  

<p>In a spring drowsiness, Li dozed off against the wall. In a rare dream, he was back in his carefree teenage years. He was never thought of as the next ruler, as his older brother was in line to succeed. Li indulged himself with the maidens’ dancing and singing, with poetry and painting, and with Buddhism. When his brother died unexpectedly, and he became the ruler, he was not too bothered either — he had even more freedom and resources to do what he liked. Pitiable were the officials who tried to divert his attention to politics and military affairs — they were simply executed.</p>

<p>“Lunch!” a guard shouted as he barged into the room, holding a wooden tray with two bowls of plain buns and some pickles. Li, startled awake, silently watched the guard walking in, putting the plate on the table, and closing the door.</p>

<p>“What are my people eating now?” Li found his thoughts wandering back to the dream a moment ago. “But it's not my country anymore.” He quickly self-corrected. “Yet, how many of them are still alive? What kind of life are they living? Hopefully better than mine, of course. The palace will probably still be there — it’s too magnificent and too much work to rebuild. Did they change the drapes, and throw away my writing? Ah, the talented maidens, they will probably never be as generously rewarded.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this ruthless spring brings so much memory. But I shan’t blame the spring — how many more springs will I see? Ha. I used to say I knew of sorrow. Sorrow when an exquisite piece of music eventually ended, sorrow when my beloved wife died, sorrow when I couldn’t live long enough to read and write all the beautiful things. But now, now, I only long to see the Yangtze River one more time in the spring, with all its majestic tides, and let out a sigh.”</p>
","<p>As one can see, this translation is in no way faithful to the form of the original. The original was created under a set pattern (<em>ci pai</em>, <span lang=""zh"">詞牌</span>) that predetermined the number of characters in every line as well as their tones and rhyme scheme. By compromising on word-for-word fidelity, rhyme, and original imagery, among other things, however, this expansion into a narrative prose has the advantage of integrating background information with the scene and emotion of the poem by using Li’s dream, which is purely imagined. I borrowed ideas from the original in recreating this scene. For example, flowers, which indicate the advent of spring, are engraved on the windows. Another important feature is that Li does not speak a word in this entire narrative, nor does he show any emotion. This reservedness and the guard’s disrespect towards Li imply his miserable current situation, as he lives under the mercy of the new ruler, and help to tangibly illustrate the sorrow beyond words. Li’s personal reflections (dead elder brother, love for Buddhism, execution of loyal officials, passion for music and dance) are historically true.</p> ","<p>Li Yu (<span lang=""zh"">李煜</span>, 937–978 CE) was the third and the last ruler of the Southern Tang regime during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960 CE). Li was not interested in politics, but rather indulged himself with the arts and sensual pleasures. He surrendered the capital to the ruler of the Song regime and lived under what we today may call home custody, though he did not live in his former home, the palace. This drastic change in his life circumstances resulted in a huge shift in the tone and content of his poems. Li switched from flowery descriptions of sensual pleasures to a more colloquial vocabulary and wrote laments about larger and heavier topics such as regime changes and the vicissitudes of life. His laments pioneered <em>ci</em>, a form of Chinese poetry. The stark contrast between his political incapability and his artistic genius makes Li a famous exemplar of the power of fate; people ponder the irony of the tragic destiny that turned him into one of the greatest Chinese poets of all time.</p>
<p>This poem was written during the period of Li’s home custody, and it was speculated that the grief and lament in this poem contributed to the new ruler’s decision to poison Li.</p>

When translating, you choose to phrase a line in one way rather than another, and the new language assigns meaning to the poem.

In the end, “lashes cease to signify” won in order to preserve the rhyme with lines four and eight.</p>","<p>Paul Celan was born in 1920 in Chernivsti, the capital of Bukovina, formerly northern Romania.

In 1945, Celan relocated to Bucharest, where he translated Russian into Romanian and published his first poems.

<p>In the original, a period ends the first stanza, but I decided to end the stanza with a colon. The colon brings a cohesiveness to the translation, connecting the speaker’s experience to the memories and the June day. The second stanza of the poem was the most difficult for me to translate. The problem was not in conveying what the original poem was saying, but in structuring those ideas in English and fitting them into the rest of the translation. I played around with several arrangements, but ultimately settled on the current version because I felt that it sounded the most cohesive when read aloud. Other arrangements of that stanza that I read in other translations or tried to create myself were awkward and confused the meaning of the poem. My only concern for the current version is in the lack of punctuation, which could cause one to rush as they read it. Nevertheless, these decisions, among others, allow my translation of “Memories Watch Me” to both accurately represent my interpretation of Tranströmer’s thoughts and be pleasing to the ear.</p>","<p>Born in 1931, Tomas Tranströmer was a Swedish poet, translator, and psychologist.

Tranströmer’s work is internationally acclaimed and has been translated into over sixty languages. His poetry is admired for its distinctive language and form, most evident in his use of metaphor and his concision. He chose to address ideas of human isolation, memory, and identity and to integrate them with images of nature. In 1990, Tranströmer suffered a stroke that left him paralyzed and robbed him of his ability to speak. Nevertheless, he continued to write poetry.

you-are-not-poetry,Poesía no eres tú,You Are Not Poetry,Rosario Castellanos,Stephanie Diaz,"Porque si tú existieras
tendría que existir yo también. Y eso es mentira.

Nada hay más que nosotros: la pareja,
los sexos conciliados en un hijo,
las dos cabezas juntas, pero no contemplándose
(para no convertir a nadie en un espejo)
sino mirando frente a sí, hacia el otro.

El otro: mediador, juez, equilibrio
entre opuestos, testigo,
nudo en el que se anuda lo que se había roto.

El otro, la mudez que pide voz
al que tiene la voz
y reclama el oído del que escucha.

El otro. Con el otro
la humanidad, el diálogo, la poesía, comienzan.","Because if you existed,
I would also have to, and that is wrong.

Nothing but us: the couple, 
sexes reconciled in a child,
heads together, neither studying the other
(to avoid turning into a mirror)
instead looking ahead towards each other.

The other: mediator, judge, balance
between opposites. Witness, knot
in which the broken is tied.

The other: muteness that asks
a voice of he who has one
and demands the ear of he who listens

The other. With whom
humanity, dialogue, and poetry begin.","<p>Above all, this poem seemed both intensely personal and yet widely universal. In this poem Castellanos addresses her quarrels with the concept of what a relationship is and what this means to her existence as an individual. I think that it’s particularly important to consider the time and place in which “Poesía no eres tú” was created, as the role of women at this point in time was often very restrictive.</p>
<p>In translating this poem, I stumbled on the first stanza because of the line “Y eso es mentira.” First of all, the line begins with the word “and,” a conjunction which every elementary teacher clearly told me should never start a sentence. In the original version I found that <em>y</em> has a more disruptive quality because the sharp sound of its pronunciation does not allow you to rest after the end of the first sentence, but instead pushes you into Castellanos’ next definitive line. Secondly, the sentence itself is a bit tricky since it does not use an article. Literally, the line reads “And that is lie.” To clear up this issue, I first tried to simply insert the article and say, “And that is a lie.” However, I found that this version did not quite pack the same punch that Castellano’s did. I then realized that what made her version so impactful was that I could imagine the lines being spoken in an argument, so my translation of “and that is <em>wrong</em>” was my effort to replicate this effect.</p>
","<p>Rosario Castellanos, born in 1925, was a Mexican writer and diplomat who is considered one of Mexico’s most important authors and poets. Castellanos wrote on topics including Mexican culture and gender, often focusing on the intersection and implications of being a Mexican woman. Another subject which Castellanos highlighted in her works was the indigenous population of her native Chiapas. In addition to addressing injustices committed against this population, Castellanos also worked with the National Indigenous Institute to improve literacy in this region. In her later years Castellano served as the Mexican ambassador to Israel.</p>",,Spanish,es,,,,,,,2018,submission

我亲爱的祖国！","I am the wan, battered waterwheel by your riverbank,
weaving a haggard song for hundreds of years;
I am the smoke-smeared miner’s lamp on your forehead, 
shining into the tunnel of your history, 
searching and groping.
I am the husk of rice, shriveled; the roadbed, out of repair;
I am the barge mired in the silted strand,
towed, a rope 
carving into your arms and shoulders;
— O Motherland!

I am poverty, 
I am sorrow.
I am your generations of generations
        in aching hope,
I am the flowers in the wide sleeves of Feitian
that, for thousands of years,
have not landed;
— O Motherland!

I am your youngest wish, 
shaking off the cobwebs of mythos;
I am the embryo of an ancient lotus, 
germinating under your quilt of snow;
I am the tears pooling in the crease of your smile;
I am your starting line, just painted;
the red light of dawn, 
        effusing, racing, 
outpouring;
— O Motherland!

I am one fraction of your billions, 
I am the sum of your nine-million-six-hundred-thousand square;
You with your breasts, inscribed 
with wounds, have nurtured me, 
who waits 
in bewilderment, in musing, in rapture;
so from my body of skin and pulse
please, take
your glory, your flourishing, your liberation;
— O Motherland,
My dear Motherland!","<p>I used to be daunted by the impossible task of being “absolutely faithful” in translation but have since learned to enjoy the process as a creative endeavor while maintaining the utmost respect for the poet and the original work. In ""O Motherland, My Dear Motherland,"" what I tried to preserve was not the word-for-word translation, but the overall sentiment: we are enraptured by our country’s glorious moments, and we become deeply disappointed when she stops trying for herself.</p>

<p>The first two lines in the original poem rhyme, with a variation in inflection that is unique to Chinese lyricism. Having recognized that it is very difficult to preserve such end rhyme without compromising syntactic clarity in English, I decided to utilize internal rhyme (“battered,” “haggard”), and let the poem sing through alliteration and assonance (“wan,” “waterwheel,” “weaving”). These drawn-out sounds also aptly capture the weariness of the old waterwheel with an almost onomatopoeia, a pleasant surprise that even the original Chinese could not deliver. Such an aspect of the poem is a result of my process: I read the lines aloud one time after another to let the sounds come to me and guide me, and then, amazingly, the meanings soon followed.</p>

<p>In the poem, the imagery least accessible to English speakers is perhaps <em>Feitian</em>, which refers to the flying female spirits painted on the walls of <em>Mogaoku</em> in <em>Dunhuang</em> (widely known as “Thousand Buddha Grottoes”). I initially translated the imagery into <em>apsaras</em> — defined by the Oxford Dictionary as female spirits in Hindu and Buddhist culture. Yet I soon realized how the seemingly accessible rendering could be misleading. <em>Apsaras</em> are strongly associated with Indian Buddhism. <em>Feitian</em> evokes the many treasured Chinese relics in <em>Dunhuang</em> that have been snatched by other civilizations and are, still, unreturned. This case presents a stricter version of “faithfulness” in translation — an impossible yet necessary task.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the word choice in the original poem was no less difficult; Shu Ting’s work was initially denied publishing on the basis of superfluous imagery and obscurity. The “waterwheel” we see here was an edit from “windmill” in an effort to make it more relatable to the average Chinese man. Another suggestion was made to change “weaving [the song]” to “singing [the song]” (“how could one weave a song?”), but Shu Ting remained firm in her choice. The poem was finally published in the official poetry journal, <em>Shi Kan</em>, and became widely applauded for the human, fervent, and discerning expression of “patriotism.”</p>","<p>Shu Ting (1952–) is arguably the most celebrated contemporary Chinese female poet. Born in Fujian in Southeast China, she lived through the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), the most tumultuous and tortured years for Chinese intellectuals. In 1969, she was sent to the countryside, forced by the government who sought to transform “privileged urban-educated youths” into “cultural workers” to serve the people. This movement destroyed many treasured Chinese literary and artistic works; the entire generation was denied access to formal education. It also inspired poets like Shu Ting to read and write even more fervently in quiet protest.</p>

<p>Widely considered a part of the “Misty School” along with poets like Bei Dao and Gu Cheng, Shu Ting writes in a penetrating language beyond the label. “O Motherland, My Dear Motherland” won the National Poetry Award in 1980; more importantly, it speaks of profound, ambivalent feelings that one can harbor for one’s country. Shu Ting is now back in her hometown, serving as the Chair of Xiamen Federation of Literary Art Circles and Member of China Writers’ Association.</p>

She never thought she would become a translator until she found herself angry at the <em>absence</em> of good translations and the <em>presence</em> of bad translations of most Chinese poems.

<h1>8</h1>
Ты все равно придешь — зачем же не теперь?
Я жду тебя — мне очень трудно.
Я потушила свет и отворила дверь
Тебе, такой простой и чудной.
Прими для этого какой угодно вид,
Ворвись отравленным снарядом
Иль с гирькой подкрадись, как опытный бандит,
Иль отрави тифозным чадом.
Иль сказочкой, придуманной тобой
И всем до тошноты знакомой,—
Чтоб я увидела верх шапки голубой
И бледного от страха управдома.
Мне все равно теперь. Клубится Енисей,
Звезда Полярная сияет.
И синий блеск возлюбленных очей
Последний ужас застилает.

<h1>Эпилог</h1>
<h1>I</h1>
Узнала я, как опадают лица,
Как из-под век выглядывает страх,
Как клинописи жесткие страницы
Страдание выводит на щеках,
Как локоны из пепельных и черных
Серебряными делаются вдруг,
Улыбка вянет на губах покорных,
И в сухоньком смешке дрожит испуг.
И я молюсь не о себе одной,
А обо всех, кто там стоял со мною,
И в лютый холод, и в июльский зной
Под красною ослепшею стеною.

<h1>To Death</h1>
You will come. Why not at once?
I wait for you. I find it difficult. 
I have blown out the candles, unlocked the door
for you, simple and wondrous thing. 
Put on any sort of face, any form —
blow me up with an arsenious grenade, 
or sneak up with a kettlebell, like an experienced bandit
or infect me with typhus,
or do it with a little story, made up by you
and familiar to all, ad nauseam —
for which I will be taken
past the blanched face of the superintendent
to the commander in the blue cap.
It’s all the same for me now:
The Yenisei river ripples, Polaris twinkles
and the blue gleam of the beloved eyes 
glazes over in the final terror.     

<h1>Epilogue</h1>
<h1>I</h1>
I’ve soon found out how faces fall,
how lashes hide a trace of fear,
how suffering is etched on cheeks
in crude strokes of cuneiform,
how strands of black or ashen hair
can silver in a day or hour,
the smile wilts on docile lips, 
the hollow laugh trembles with fear. 
I pray not for myself alone
but everyone who stood with me;
in savage cold, in the heat of July  
beside a wall, brick-red and blind. 
","<p>Akhmatova’s <em>Requiem</em> is a cycle of poems about the years of terror in Russia (1935–1938) known as the Great Purge. Although written during and soon after the events it describes, the cycle remained unpublished in Russia until 1987, thirty-five years after Stalin’s death. The two poems above capture the two main subjects of the cycle: Akhmatova’s individual suffering and the suffering of the many in Russia. In “To Death,” Akhmatova alludes either to her son Lev being taken to a labor camp in Siberia or to her former husband, Nikolai Gumilev, being shot. In “Epilogue I,” Akhmatova mentions all those who waited on the prison lines to visit friends and family members, often to no avail. The shift from the individual to the collective is distinct here in that Akhmatova’s voice remains heard; the pronoun “I” is still used.</p>
<p>I chose not to carry over the formal structure of the poems, which includes rhyme and a distinct Russian cadence, as it is heavily reliant on the Russian language’s easily-formed end-rhymes and fluid word order. However, some echo of form may be felt in the use of iambic tetrameter of “Epilogue I.” Although the emotional register of the poems is expressed in the original through the rhyme and rhythm, giving the content its expressive power, I tried to stay as close as possible to the images in the poem, which communicate by being direct and precise, and letting the sound follow.</p>
","<p>Anna Akhmatova (1889–1966) was an acclaimed Russian poet of the “Silver Age” of Russian poetry, the first half of the twentieth century. After moving to St. Petersburg, Akhmatova became a part of the Acmeists, a literary group of six people who attempted to write poetry in traditional form that focused on the objects and incidents of everyday life, in contrast with the highly experimental poetry in fashion at the time. During the war years, Akhmatova’s former husband Nikolai Gumilev was shot, her son Lev was imprisoned and exiled to Siberia, and her close friend Osip Mandelstam was arrested, exiled, and shot. <em>Requiem</em>, along with many other poems, was a response to those times. Beginning in 1925, Akhmatova’s poetry was banned by the Soviet government; even when the official ban was lifted, the implicit ban remained. Still, her poetry circulated orally and on scraps of paper that were burned upon being read. Akhmatova is known as the mother of the modern female Russian voice, freeing it to speak about complex topics including and other than love. She is also known as one of the only well-known poets to outlive the Stalinist era, stay in Russia, and chronicle those times.</p>
","<p>Yehudith Dashevsky is a junior studying English, Russian, and Hebrew literature. She has also dabbled in Arabic and Old English. Her fascination with translation stems from her mental blocks in the world of words, and she is repeatedly amazed at how the space in the imagination before language is bridged when the right words (for a given time and place) are found. One word she recently encountered and was surprised exists is “idiolect,” which according to Wikipedia is “an individual’s distinctive and unique use of language.”</p>",Russian,ru,{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/images_18/ahkmatova.JPG,,photo by Daila Wolfson,,,,2018,submission

O sorella dell’ombra,
Notturna quanto più la luce ha forza,
M’insegui, morte.
In un giardino puro
Alla luce ti diè l’ingenua brama
E la pace fu persa,
Pensosa morte,
Sulla tua bocca.
Da quel momento
Ti odo nel fluire della mente
Approfondite lontananze,
Emula sofferente dell’eterno.
Madre velenosa degli evi
Nella paura del palpito
E della solitudine,
Bellezza punita e ridente,
Nell’assopirsi della carne
Sognatrice fuggente,
Atleta senza sonno
Della nostra grandezza,
Quando m’avrai domato, dimmi:
Nella malinconia dei vivi
Volerà a lungo la mia ombra?
<h1>Canto secondo</h1>
Scava le intime vite
Della nostra infelice maschera
(clausura d’infinito)
Con blandizia fanatica
La buia veglia dei padri.
Morte, muta parola,
Sabbia deposta come un letto
Dal sangue,
Ti odo cantare come una cicala
Nella rosa abbrunata dei riflessi.
<h1>Canto terzo</h1>
Incide le rughe segrete
Della nostra infelice maschera
La beffa infinita dei padri.
Tu, nella luce fonda,
O confuso silenzio,
Insisti come le cicale irose.
<h1>Canto quarto</h1>
Mi presero per mano nuvole.
Brucio sul colle spazio e tempo,
Come un tuo messaggero,
Come il sogno, divina morte.
<h1>Canto quinto</h1>
Hai chiuso gli occhi.
Nasce una morte
Piena di finte buche,
Di suoni morti,
Come di sugheri
Di reti calate nell’acqua.
Le tue mani si fanno come un soffio
D’inviolabili lontananze,
Inafferrabili come le idee,
E l’equivoco della luna
E il dondolio, dolcissimi,
Se vuoi posarmele sugli occhi,
Toccano l’anima.
Sei la donna che passa
Come una foglia
E lasci agli alberi un fuoco d’autunno.
<h1>Canto sesto</h1>
O bella preda,
Voce notturna,
Le tue movenze
Fomentano la febbre.
Solo tu, memoria demente,
La libertà potevi catturare.
Sulla tua carne inafferrabile
E vacillante dentro specchi torbidi,
Quali delitti, sogno,
Non m’insegnasti a consumare?
Con voi, fantasmi, non ho mai ritegno,
E dei vostri rimorsi ho pieno il cuore
Quando fa giorno.
","<h1>First Canto</h1>
O sister of shadow,
darker in the brightest of lights,
you chase me, death.
In an untouched garden
naive craving bore you,
and peace,
pensive death,
was lost on your mouth.
Since that moment
I have heard you in the flows of my mind
deepening distances,
aching imitator of the eternity.
Venomous mother of ages,
in the fear of throb
and loneliness,
punished and laughing Beauty,
in the slumber of flesh,
fugitive dreamer,
sleepless athlete
of our greatness,
once you have tamed me, tell me:
Will my shadow fly long
in the melancholy of the living?
<h1>Second Canto</h1>
The dark vigil of our fathers
with its crazy blandishments
hollows out the intimate lives
of our unhappy mask
(enclosure of the infinite).
Death, still word,
sand laid as a bed
by blood,
I hear you singing like a locust
in the darkened rose of reflections.
<h1>Third Canto</h1>
The eternal deception of our fathers
Engraves secret wrinkles
On our unhappy masks.
In the broad light,
you, confused silence,
insist like tense locusts.
<h1>Fourth Canto</h1>
Clouds took me by the hand.
Upon the hill, I consume space and time
like your harbinger,
like a dream, divine death.
<h1>Fifth canto</h1>
You have closed your eyes.
A night is born,
a night full of false holes,
of dead sounds,
like corks
of nets dropped into the water.
Your hands become a breath
of inviolable distances,
as unreachable as ideas,
and the moon’s ambiguity
and its swinging — so tender —
if you want to lay them on my eyes,
they touch my soul.
You are the woman
who goes by like a leaf
and you leave the trees like a fire during fall.
<h1>Sixth canto</h1>
O beautiful prey,
nocturnal voice,
the way you move
raises my fever.
Only you, demented memory,
could capture freedom.
On your flesh, unreachable
and wavering in turbid mirrors,
what crimes, dream,
didn’t you lead me to commit?
With you, ghosts, I have no restraint
and my heart is filled with your remorse
when a new day rises.
","<p>As usually happens when translating poetry, the title is the first challenge presented
to the translator, and “La morte meditata” is no exception. First of all, one wonders what
“la morte meditata” actually means. I believe the meaning of the title is closely connected
to the act of reflecting on something, to meditate on what on what all human beings have
in common — mortality. At some point of their lives, all people question themselves about
death. This why I decided to translate the title as “The Meditated Death.” It does not
refer to death per se, but, more precisely, it refers to that meditated death that inevitably
becomes part of people’s thoughts.</p>
<p>The poem is divided into six <em>canti</em>, which I decided to keep as “canto.” The most
obvious and literal translation would be “song,” but I do not think it gives justice to
Ungaretti’s word choice. Furthermore, the word “canto” echoes the one hundred cantos of
Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em> — at least to the ears of an Italian speaker — and I think it is a fair
tribute to the Italian literary tradition. One of the lines I liked the most is the fifth line of
the second canto, where death is defined as <em>muta parola</em> — “mute word.” It is an
exceptionally powerful and paradoxical image, full of tension: How can a word be mute? It
can be so before it is spoken, when a word is still an idea, but it is nonetheless striking to
the reader. Instead of opting for “mute,” the most straightforward equivalent, I preferred
using “still.” It is such an interesting word in English, because it conveys both the meaning
related to the sound, but also the idea of steadiness. And of course, nothing can be as
steady and motionless as death.</p>","<p>Giuseppe Ungaretti was born on February 10, 1888, in Alexandria, Egypt, from an Italian family originating from Lucca (Tuscany). The multicultural and cosmopolitan city of Alexandria had a considerable influence both on his life and on his work. Ungaretti is mostly known in Italy as “Il poeta Ssldato,” that is, “the soldier poet.” In 1915, in fact, when Italy joined World War I, he decided to volunteer. World War I left a mark on his life. He got to know both the suffering of war, but also the true meaning of brotherhood.</p>
<p>Giuseppe Ungaretti is certainly one of the most appreciated Italian poets of the twentieth century. Students remember him for writing very short and incisive poems, but what makes him so great is his experience of war that gave a very introspective cut to his poetry.</p>","<p>My name is Carla Rossi, I’m twenty-five, and I’m from Italy. Last year I spent the spring semester at Penn, and I fell in love with it. I’ve just graduated from the University of Bologna in conference interpreting, with a concentration in English and Spanish — so I mostly translate speeches from English and Spanish into Italian (but also the other way around).

","<p>I was drawn to translate Benedetti’s work from Spanish into English for much the same reason, I think, as Benedetti was drawn to translate the world from experience into poetry. Which is to say, not because I immediately loved it or found it beautiful, but rather because it confused and overwhelmed me, and I wanted to figure it out. Benedetti’s work is chaotic, wordy, both straightforward and cacophonous. There are too many simultaneous truths, there is too much death for life to hold, there are too many words, and the words can’t hold the death, either. I wanted to translate “El verbo” almost as a coping mechanism, some way to methodically and concretely process a mess that resists detangling.</p>
<p>Benedetti writes in a conversational tone, no flourishes: “This people is overripe for revolution and for innocence.” “The verb will not be god.” <em>The world is a mess and words are failing us. I will throw them at you in a fluid stream and hope that something sticks.</em> Somehow this head-on confrontation of injustices, for all its matter-of-fact-ness, can’t make sense of the mess. To me, understanding Benedetti’s poetic translations of experience means understanding that words can’t make sense of unfathomable horror, be they fragments or sentences or Spanish or English. The world is not right; Benedetti searches frantically within and between and underneath words, grasping at some sense of understanding. Whether he achieves it is another question. Whether I achieve it by puzzling through his puzzling is also another question. Reading and translating Benedetti requires rigorous dialogue between how the world is and how it ought to be. Whether we get to the bottom of this or not, that dialogue is a good place to start.</p>","<p>Mario Benedetti (1920–2009) came of age and died in Montevideo, Uruguay, the country’s coastal capital that serves as a backdrop for much of Benedetti’s poetry. Part of the Generación del ’45, he was and is one of the most widely read poets in Latin America, revered for his seamless interweaving of love and politics and best-known for his short stories. In his youth he worked as a car mechanic, typist, secretary, journalist, and translator of Kafka from German into Spanish.  Benedetti was a vocal figure in left-wing political organizing in Uruguay. He was passionate and active in shaping domestic politics, championing revolutions in Puerto Rico and Cuba, and criticizing US political and economic involvement in Latin American dictatorships. The poet also wrote plays and novels and was heavily involved in journalism. He founded and led a leftist magazine called <em>Marcha</em>, which was shut down when Benedetti was forced into exile during the country’s 1973 military coup. He moved first to Buenos Aires, but fled to Cuba, Peru, and finally Spain following threats from Argentina’s right-wing military regime. He returned to Uruguay after twelve years of exile and split his time between Montevideo and Madrid until his death at eighty-eight.</p>","<p>Ella Konefal is a Penn junior studying fine arts and comparative literature.

בֵּין יַמִּים סוֹעֲרִים שֶׁל הַדָּם,
הִנְנִי מַבְעִירָה פַּנָּסִי הַקָּטָן,
לְחַפֵּשׂ, לְחַפֵּשׂ בֶּן-אָדָם.
 
שַׁלְהֲבוֹת הַשְּׂרֵפָה מַדְעִיכוֹת פַּנָּסִי,
אוֹר הָאֵשׁ מְסַנְוֵר אֶת עֵינַי;
אֵיךְ אַבִּיט, אֵיךְ אֶרְאֶה, אֵיךְ אֵדַע, אֵיךְ אַכִּיר,
כְּשֶׁהוּא יַעֲמֹד לְפָנַי?
 
תֵּן סִימָן, אֱלֹהִים, תֵּן סִימָן עַל מִצְחוֹ,
כִּי בָּאֵשׁ, בַּדְלֵקָה וּבַדָּם,
כֵן אַכִּיר אֶת הַזִּיק הַטָּהוֹר, הַנִּצְחִי,
אֶת אֲשֶׁר חִפַּשְׂתִּיו:  בֶּן-אָדָם.
","In the fire, explosions, the pyre of war. 
Between days that are stormy with blood,
I am burning my little lamp, casting the light,
and I search, and I search for someone.

The blaze darkens the glow of my little lamp’s flame,
it is so bright that I cannot see; 
will I realize, gaze forth, will I know, ascertain 
when he finally stands before me?

Give a sign, Blessed God, on his forehead a sign,
for in fire, in explosions and blood,
I will see the pure spark, see the infinite spark, 
and find what I have searched for: someone.","<p>In the original Hebrew, there are twelve syllables in the first and third lines of each four-line stanza. These lines are not rhymed. The second and fourth lines contain nine syllables and are rhymed. The poem as a whole follows a tribrachic meter, meaning each line comprises an assortment of three short, unstressed syllables.</p>
<p>I was able to recreate the syllabic makeup of each stanza, as well as the rhyme scheme. To do this successfully, I had to make a few sacrifices. For instance, notwithstanding the primacy of syllabic triplets in <span lang=""he"">במדורות מלחמה</span>, I could not incorporate tribrachic meter into this translation. I found it impossible to both rhyme the second and fourth lines and translate into the original meter without totally transforming the diction. I ought to mention that, strictly speaking, there is no rhyme in the first and final stanzas, merely an assonance between “blood” and “someone.” Given, first, my ultimate objective of representing the essence of the original piece, second, the parameters of my translation and, third, the exact rhyme in the second stanza, I believe my readers will be able to infer that the original Hebrew bears a rhyme.</p>","<p>Like many European Jews in the early twentieth century, Hannah Szenes was captivated by the prospect of establishing a Jewish homeland. As a teenager in Budapest, she joined local Zionist youth movements, eventually emigrating to Palestine in 1939 at the age of seventeen. For two years she lived in an agricultural cooperative (in Hebrew, <em>moshav</em>) in Nahalal. It was here that she composed, among other works, “In the Pyre of War.” In 1941, she relocated to a <em>kibbutz</em> in Caesarea.</p>
<p>In 1943 Szenes joined a Zionist paramilitary organization called the Palmach as a volunteer. A year later, she joined the organization’s paratrooper unit, and, in 1944, was dropped into Yugoslavia to aid anti-Nazi forces. Only hours after entering Hungary, which was the central objective of the mission, Szenes and her compatriots were captured and imprisoned. Although Szenes was tortured for months, she never capitulated to her captors. In late November 1944, she was offered the choice to petition for clemency or face the firing squad. She did not want to beg for her life; she chose to die. Szenes faced her executioners without a blindfold. She was twenty-three.</p>
