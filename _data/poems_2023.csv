cobweb-clues-counting,蛛丝迹：数,Cobweb Clues: Counting,Jiemin Liu (刘洁岷),Yi Feng,"我在平原上数影子的数目
记起一个细节的代价是
忘掉更多的轮廓

中国的农村已飘逝而去

2013.3","On the plain I counted the number of shadows
The cost of remembering one detail is to
forget more contours

On the highway, the traffic was noisily shuttling
Rural China was flowing away

March, 2013","<p>I like Jiemin Liu’s poems not only because of the nostalgia in the loss of the rural due to the industrialization in China, but also due to the estrangement, puns and dynamics in his poetic language. When I translated his poems, I tried to keep the original cultural features of the Chinese language in my English translation. For instance, the title of the poem’s literary translation is “Cobweb’s Traces: Counting” and the semantic translation is “Clues: Counting.” My translation is “Cobweb Clues: Counting,” which tries to combine these two translations. Cobweb, or spider’s web, in Chinese, is an abbreviation of an old Chinese saying, “<span lang=""zh"">蛛丝马迹,</span>” which refers to clues or hints, for discovering something secret or hidden. I keep the translation of the original Chinese saying to indicate the unique image in the Chinese saying, and I add “clues” — the implied meaning of the Chinese saying — after “counting” in the hope that English readers can see the subtle connection between cobweb and clues in their imagination. This poem is about the fast development of China and the industrialization of rural areas. The last stanza has a pun, which reminds me of Jean-Paul Sartre’s thoughts on William Faulkner’s nostalgia towards the old South, “Faulkner is the one who is sitting in a carriage moving forward but keeps looking back.”</p>","<p>Jiemin Liu was a poet, and a poetry editor in Wuhan, China. Born in Songzi, Hubei province, in 1964, Jiemin Liu founded <em>New Han Poetry</em>, a journal of poetry in 2003, the Modern and Contemporary Poetic Studies column in <em>Jianghan Academic</em> in 2004, and the ‘New Poetry Road’ public account number in 2016. He published and edited poetry collections, including <em>Liu Jiemin Poems, Roots and Tongue Roots, Under the Shadow of Ants,</em> and <em>Mutual Gaze</em>. His poems are also compiled and published in <em>The Distinction of Islands, The Charm of Group Portraits, Cross-Strait Poetry Collection in the 21st Century</em>. He now lives in Wuhan.</p>","<p>Yi Feng is a scholar, translator, poet, and associate professor at Northeastern University, China. Her English poems have been published in <em>The Penn Review, Model Minority</em>, and <em>Voice & Verse Poetry Magazine</em>. Her Chinese poems have been published in Lotus (<span lang=""zh"">芙蓉</span>) and Chinese Poetry Website.

","I am done with the discreet lyricism
The well-behaved lyricism
The public servant-like lyricism with timesheets fixed hours protocols and showing how much they appreciate the mr. big boss

I am done with the lyricism that stops to consult a dictionary for the vernacular nature of a word

Down with purists

All the words, especially the universal barbarisms
All the constructions, especially the exceptions of syntax
All the rhythms, especially the innumerable ones

I am done with this lyricism
flirtatious
political
rickety
syphilitic
With all the lyricism that surrenders to whatever is outside of itself

Besides that, it is not lyricism
It is accounting cosines table secretary of the exemplary lover with a hundred letter templates and the different ways to please women, etc.

I would rather have the lyricism of the lunatics
The lyricism of the drunkards
The lyricism of the drunkards, so difficult and pungent
The lyricism of Shakespeare’s clowns

– I don’t care about the lyricism that is not liberation","<p>This was a great opportunity to translate one of my favorite poems. “Poética,” with its very modernist manifesto-like tone, struck a chord with me the first time I read it. The poem speaks to a return to lyricism that, instead of being perceived as bureaucratic like its Parnassian predecessors, is modern, pungent, and critical. At the same time, it asks and allows for a series of innovations considered impossible in previous Brazilian literary movements. I hope to live up to Bandeira’s original and adequately convey the poem-as-a-joke, which is simultaneously political and comical.</p>
<p>As some grammatical devices do not work the same way in English and Portuguese, there was a need for compromises like the ones in the notes above. Nevertheless, trying to find a way around it during the translation process was quite enjoyable.</p>

<p>Below are some lines with specific translations of interest:</p>

<p>(1) The beginning of the first line, “Eu estou farto,” can also be translated as “I am tired” and similar expressions, but I chose to use “I am done” to give the translation a more contemporary tone.</p>
<p>(2) Here, instead of “sr. diretor” (Mr. Director), I chose to use “mr. big boss” to add to the general comic tone present in the poem.</p>
<p>(3) Although in the original, the words for “political,” “rickety,” and “syphilitic” rhyme, there was no better alternative to translate into English than the current attempt. In addition, since in Portuguese adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, I had to adapt the rhythm for the fifth stanza, positioning “lyricism” after the last adjective.</p>
<p>(4) Similarly, there was a choice to translate some strings of adjectives as they would be written in Portuguese to create the tone to close the poem in a manifesto-like nature.</p>
<p>(5) Instead of the literal translation “I do not want to know about (…),” I preferred to use a more casual “I don’t care.”</p>","<p>Manuel Bandeira, in full Manuel Carneiro de Sousa Bandeira Filho (b. April 19, 1886, in Recife, Brazil, and died Oct. 13, 1968, Rio de Janeiro) was one of the principal figures in the Brazilian literary movement known as modernismo. In addition to writing poetry, he was a translator, critic, anthologist, and literary historian.</p>
<p>In his poetry, Bandeira abandoned the rhetorical tone of his predecessors and used colloquial Brazilian speech to treat prosaic themes and everyday events with directness and humor. His poems’ themes were simultaneously related to daily life and universal topics, often using a “poem-as-a-joke” approach to deal with forms and inspirations that the academic tradition of his time considered vulgar.</p>
<p>The book in which “Poética” was featured for the first time, <em>Libertinagem</em> (1930), is regarded as one of the essential books in Brazilian poetry. In the book, Bandeira brings us poems that were not only remarkable to his career but also contributed significantly to modernisto literature and Brazilian poetry in general. Furthermore, the book crowns Bandeira’s transition to modernismo in its use of free verse, colloquial language, unconventional syntax, and themes based on Brazilian folklore.</p>","<p>Fernando Ursine, from Montes Claros, Brazil, currently based in Sapporo, Japan, is a master’s student at Hokkaido University Public Policy School. His interest in Brazilian modernist literature goes back to high school when he learned about the movement in his literature classes and was amazed at the poem-manifestos written by Manuel Bandeira and Oswald de Andrade, among others, and the concept of “poem-as-a-joke,” common among the first Modernist generation authors. This fostered his passion for modern and contemporary Brazilian literature and writing. He likes to learn things, and his interests are all over the place.</p>",Portuguese,pt,/assets/images/images_23/poetica.jpeg,none,,,"<div>

i-want-to,Aku Ingin,I Want To,Sapardi Djoko Damono,Dian Febrianti,"Aku ingin mencintaimu dengan sederhana: 
dengan kata yang tak sempat diucapkan kayu 
kepada api yang menjadikannya abu.

Aku ingin mencintaimu dengan sederhana: 
dengan isyarat yang tak sempat disampaikan awan
kepada hujan yang menjadikannya tiada.","I want to love you in simplicity
with a word that the woods cannot say 
to the fire that turns it to ashes.

I want to love you in simplicity
with a cue that the clouds cannot convey 
to the rain that turns it into nothing.","<p>The poem “Aku Ingin” symbolizes a deep feeling experienced by an individual that is so beautiful and high beyond words. That person cannot describe those words in a material essence, like her physical beauty, her humor, or her smile, so he uses personification to describe how much he is willing to sacrifice for the person that he loves. I think this is fantastic; how else can a person describe an indescribable feeling?</p>
<p>I understand what makes many Indonesians love this poem: they can see themselves in this short work. Our beloved one is not always a perfect person that we can measure by material standards, but instead by what she is doing every day. Different from the western concept of falling in love, traditional Indonesians believe that love is not something that we fall into, but rather something that we build.</p>
<p>The reason why I chose this poem is its simplicity yet deep meaning. This poem is very popular among Indonesians. You often see this poem in Indonesian wedding invitations. The tradition of putting poems on wedding invitations might not be normal in other countries. Isn’t it lovely to introduce something cultural in one area, yet people from all over the world can understand, enjoy, and relate?</p>
<p>Since this is a simple poem that is written with common expressions, I don’t sacrifice much in meaning. Compromises that I make are more on the aspect of rhythm. There is a rhythm pattern of each sentence’s last word. The first and second paragraphs start with the same sentence: “Aku ingin mencintaimu dengan sederhana.” The next sentence is always followed by a word that ends in the same vowel, like the vowel “u” in <em>kayu</em> and <em>abu</em> in the first paragraph, and the vowel “a” in <em>awan</em> and <em>tiada</em> in the second paragraph.</p>
","<p>Sapardi Djoko Damono, one of the most prominent writers in Indonesia, was born in Solo, Central Java on March 20, 1940. He earned his doctorate in literature from Universitas Indonesia; at the same university, he worked as a professor. In 1982, he was chosen as a Dean of the Faculty of Literature. Sapardi’s works are recognized in Indonesia and internationally. Some awards include the Cultural Award (Australia, 1978), the Anugerah Puisi Putra (Malaysia, 1983), the S.E.A. Write Award (Thailand, 1986), the Anugerah Seni Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan (Indonesian Ministry of Education, 1990), and the ASEAN Book Award (2018). Sapardi’s works have been translated into several languages.</p>","<p>Dian Febrianti is a Fulbright FLTA at the University of Pennsylvania for 2022-2023.

house-house,Дом дом,House house,Valeriya Krutova,Ryan Hardy,"Вокруг нас дом-деревянные полы. Поля за деревянными окнами. Сквозь треснувшие стёкла пытаюсь увидеть точку, где они заканчиваются. Мы — точка, где они начинаются. Но нас окружил дом. Деревянные ставни. Дом. Деревянная мебель. Дом. 

Деревянные чувства, поступки, движения.

Я держусь за живот. Деревянный от нахлынувших чувств. Нет точки, где бы они закончились. Они нарастают с каждым прикосновением. Ты говоришь это дом моего отца, гладишь плечо. И мне холодно. Сквозняк. Спиной я чувствую твой шершавый подбородок поднимись выше — неудобно стоять на полусогнутых. Твои колени, как наш дом, — деревянные.

Между нами дом. Дом-мир. Дом-вечность. И нет точки, где бы он закончился.

Старая крепкая мебель. Запах вокруг — запах дома. Так пахнет дерево перед тем, как его срубят. Деревьев не существовало 90% времени существования планеты. Тебя не существовало 90% времени моего существования.

Дом дом не защитит нас от вечности, от скорости света, от угрозы расставания. Дом слишком деревянный, и он принадлежал твоему отцу. Отец — бывший военный. Деревянным шагом он входил в дом, теплее не становилось. Становилось страшнее. Поэтому наши прикосновения здесь — саботаж памяти, они — вопреки деревянной отцовской любви. Ты целуешь меня назло. А я пытаюсь сохраниться на этом уровне, чтобы сердце не откатилось назад.

Дом дом нас окружает, стискивает, ты чувствуешь это и крепче прижимаешься губами к затылку, тянешь волосы книзу, чтобы поцеловать макушку. Макушкой я буду трогать небо, потом целую вечность, показывая ей твой поцелуй. Макушкой я достану до крыши деревянного дома, возможно, пробью его и полечу в космос. Там — та же пустота без тебя и нашего будущего дома. Там — та же тишина. Отсутствие воздуха поглощает 100% звуков. Твоё отсутствие поглощает 100% моей жизни. Я — вечность и пустота. Листаю комнаты не нашего дома дома — свайп вверх до самого начала — и трогаю дерево, чтобы вогнать в себя побольше заноз.

Этот дом дом — сон сон. Есть ты и твой запах, остальное заблюрено. И поле есть. Горизонт завален.","All around us, there’s a house of wooden floors. There are fields behind the wooden windows. Through the cracked glass, I try to see the point where they end. We’re the point where they start. But the house surrounded us. Wooden shutters. The house. Wooden furniture. The house. Wooden feelings, happenings, motions.I hold my stomach. It’s wooden from the feelings having washed in. There isn’t a point where they might end. They swell with every touch. You say it’s my father’s house, stroke my shoulder. And I’m cold. A draft. I feel your rough chin run higher up my spine… isn’t it uncomfortable to stand with knees half-bent? Your knees, like our house, are wooden.Between us, there is the house. A house like the world. A house like eternity. And there isn’t a point where it ends.Old, study furniture. The smell is all around, the smell of the house… how wood smells before it’s cut. Trees haven’t existed for 90% of the planet’s existence. You haven’t existed for 90% of mine.The house house doesn’t protect us from eternity, from the speed of light, from the threat of parting. The house is too wooden and it belonged to your father. Your father — a former soldier. He came into the house with his wooden steps. It didn’t get any warmer. It got more frightening. That’s why our touching is a sabotage of memory. It’s in spite of the wooden fatherly love. You kiss me in spite. And I try to stay level, so my heart doesn’t recoil.The house house surrounds us, squeezes us. You feel it and press your lips tighter to the nape of my neck, pull my hair down to kiss the top of my head. With the top of my head I’ll touch the sky, then kiss eternity, showing it your kiss. With the top of my head, I’ll reach the roof of the wooden house, maybe break through it, and fly into the cosmos. There, it’s that same emptiness without you and our future home. There, it’s that same silence. Air’s absence swallows 100% of sound. Your absence swallows 100% of my life. I am eternity and emptiness. I leaf through the rooms of the house, not our house, swipe up to the very beginning, and touch the wood to force in more splinters.This home home, it’s a dream dream. There’s you and your smell… the rest is blurry. And there’s the field. The horizon is overflowing.","<p>In our correspondence, Krutova told me a bit about the poem. In a dream, she saw a house with shutters, shrouded in fog. She noted how unnerving and scary the dream was and wanted to convey this in words. When she woke up, she jotted down the first line. Upon sitting with the dream further, she wanted to break away from this unnervedness and leaned into the poem’s intimacy.</p>
<p>Krutova’s focus on repetition and the sound of words in their delivery is clear in the poem. The original’s repetition of дом дом (dom dom) or “house house” throughout creates a rhythmic motif which Krutova returns to frequently. I translated <span lang=""ru"">дом</span> to the more logically rhythmic “home” and, instead, opted for “house” to preserve the more tangible nature of the building Krutova describes. In sticking with “house,” I often chose to add the articles “a” and “the,” both of which are absent in Russian, to better space the poem’s meter. Towards the end of the poem, as the its intimacy builds, I shifted to “home” to emphasize the emotional aspects of a home instead of a house’s physical structure.</p>
<p>Translating “House house” was an exercise in delivery. Much of the original’s lyrical strength comes from the way it builds the meter’s momentum and creates an elliptical rhythm. At several points in my translation, I deviated from the original to maintain the meter’s momentum. For instance, I omitted some instances of parallelism, such as that of “Trees haven’t existed for 90% of the planet’s existence. You haven’t existed for 90% of my existence.” To preserve a sense of building metrical momentum leading into the next section and prevent the lingering meter of “existence,” I ended this line with “existed for 90% of mine.”</p>
<p>I’d like to extend special thanks to Maria Glukhova and Connor Hardy for their feedback on this translation and their presence in my life. You make each day a bit brighter.</p>","<p>Valeriya Krutova, a native of Shymkent, Qazaqstan, is a writer of short prose and poetry.

undine-goes,Undine Geht,Undine Goes,Ingeborg Bachmann,Ailie Margot,"Ihr Menschen! Ihr Ungeheuer!

Ihr Ungeheuer mit Namen Hans! Mit diesem Namen, den ich nie vergessen kann. 

Immer wenn ich durch die Lichtung kam und die Zweige sich öffneten, wenn die Ruten mir das Wasser von den Armen schlugen, die Blätter mir die Tropfen von den Haaren leckten, traf ich auf einen, der Hans hieß. 

Ja, diese Logik habe ich gelernt, daß einer Hans heißen muß, daß ihr alle so heißt, einer wie der andere, aber doch nur einer. Immer einer nur ist es, der diesen Namen trägt, den ich nicht vergessen kann, und wenn ich euch auch alle vergesse, ganz und gar vergesse, wie ich euch ganz geliebt habe. Und wenn eure Küsse und euer Samen von den vielen großen Wassern — Regen, Flüssen, Meeren — längst abgewaschen und fortgeschwemmt sind, dann ist doch der Name noch da, der sich fortpflanzt unter Wasser, weil ich nicht aufhören kann, ihn zu rufen, Hans, Hans, …

Ihr Monstren mit den festen und unruhigen Händen, mit den kurzen blassen Nägeln, den zerschürften Nägeln mit schwarzen Rändern, den weißen Manschetten um die Handgelenke, den ausgefransten Pullovern, den uniformen grauen Anzügen, den groben Lederjacken und den losen Sommerhemden! Aber laßt mich genau sein, ihr Ungeheuer, und euch jetzt einmal verächtlich machen, denn ich werde nicht wiederkommen, euren Winken nicht mehr folgen, keiner Einladung zu einem Glas Wein, zu einer Reise, zu einem Theaterbesuch. Ich werde nie wiederkommen, nie wieder Ja sagen und Du und Ja. All diese Worte wird es nicht mehr geben, und ich sage euch vielleicht, warum. Denn ihr kennt doch die Fragen, und sie beginnen alle mit »Warum?«. Es gibt keine Fragen in meinem Leben. Ich liebe das Wasser, seine dichte Durchsichtigkeit, das Grün im Wasser und die sprachlosen Geschöpfe (und so sprachlos bin auch ich bald!), mein Haar unter ihnen, in ihm, dem gerechten Wasser, dem gleichgültigen Spiegel, der es mir verbietet, euch anders zu sehen. Die nasse Grenze zwischen mir und mir…

Ich habe keine Kinder von euch, weil ich keine Fragen gekannt habe, keine Forderung, keine Vorsicht, Absicht, keine Zukunft und nicht wußte, wie man Platz nimmt in einem anderen Leben. Ich habe keinen Unterhalt gebraucht, keine Beteuerung und Versicherung, nur Luft, Nachtluft, Küstenluft, Grenzluft, um immer wieder Atem holen zu können für neue Worte, neue Küsse, für ein unaufhörliches Geständnis: Ja. Ja. Wenn das Geständnis abgelegt war, war ich verurteilt zu lieben; wenn ich eines Tages freikam aus der Liebe, mußte ich zurück ins Wasser gehen, in dieses Element, in dem niemand sich ein Nest baut, sich ein Dach aufzieht über Balken, sich bedeckt mit einer Plane. Nirgendwo sein, nirgendwo bleiben. Tauchen, ruhen, sich ohne Aufwand von Kraft bewegen — und eines Tages sich besinnen, wieder auftauchen, durch eine Lichtung gehen, ihn sehen und »Hans« sagen. Mit dem Anfang beginnen.

»Guten Abend.«
»Guten Abend.«
»Wie weit ist es zu dir?«
»Weit ist es, weit.«
»Und weit ist es zu mir.«","You humans! You monsters!

You monsters named Hans! To those of you with this name which I cannot forget.

When I come through the clearing and the branches open, when the river reeds whisk the water from my arms, the leaves licking the droplets from my hair, I meet someone whose name is Hans. 

Yes, I learned this logic which demands that one of them be named Hans, which you are called, each one of you just like the other, but actually only one. It’s always only one who bears this name which I cannot forget completely and totally as I have loved you. And when your kisses and seed have been long ago washed off and swept away by the many great waters–rains, rivers, oceans– the name is still here under water, breeding, because I cannot cease calling it out, Hans, Hans…

You monsters with the steady and easy hands, with the short, sallow nails, dirty with black at their rims, the white shirt cuffs around the wrists, the frayed sweatshirts, the uniformed grey suits, the coarse leather jackets and the oversized T-shirts! Let me be clear, you monsters, and say it just once, because I will not return, will no longer follow your beckoning, an invitation to a glass of wine, to a vacation, to a visit to the theater. I will never come back, never again say Yes and You and Yes. These words will never more be given, and I tell you perhaps why. Because you all know the questions, and they all begin with “why?” There are no questions in my life. I love the water, its thick transparency, its greeness, and its speechless creatures (and just as speechless I will also be!), my hair under them, in it, the righteous water, the indifferent looking glass that forbids me to see you differently. The wet boundary between me and me… 

I have no children from you, because I have known no questions, demands, precautions, no future, and I have never known how to take up space in another life. I have no livelihood, no assurance, no security, only air, night air, coastal air, air from borderlands so that I may always be able to draw breath for new words, new kisses, for a constant confession: Yes. Yes. Were the confession to be discarded, I would be condemned to love; were I to come free for a day out of love, I would have to go back in the water, in this element in which no one builds themselves a nest, spins themselves a roof out of timber, decks themselves out with a plan. Nowhere to be. Nowhere to remain. To submerge, to recline, to move without the deference to power– and one day to change direction, to re-emerge, to go through a clearing, to see “him” and say “Hans.” To begin with the beginning: 

“Good evening.”
“Good evening.” 
“How far is it to you?”
“Far it is, far.” 
“And far is it to me.”","<p>The 1811 myth of a water-nymph named Undine — the same fairy tale that inspired Hans Christian Andersen’s <em>Little Mermaid</em> — inspired Ingeborg Bachmann to reclaim Undine as a central speaking figure. Rather than depending on sexual difference in order to speak, or falling in love with a man to gain legs, Bachmann’s <em>Undine</em> refuses human language as she does gendered codes, instead chastising, and then leaving, her audience, whom she addresses as “Hans.”</p>
<p>Bachmann’s difficult-to-parse phrases and repetition peppered throughout call attention to the way in which the signifier always misses the thing it signifies. That is, words always miss their mark, fall imperfectly, never quite get it right. Refusing to live on land, Bachmann’s protagonist offers an alternative to fitting herself into words, even as she speaks from within them.</p>
<p>With a writer like Bachmann, compromises abound for a translator. For me, one has been the loss of syntactic rhythm. <em>Ungeheuer</em>, for example, loses its aural rhythm and ugliness when translated as the English “monster.” The double meaning of particular German words that do not carry with them the same multiplicity in English has also been lost. For example, <em>gehören</em> in German means “to belong,” but shares a root with the word which means “to listen” (<em>hören</em>). Listening and belonging are combined in German through a shared root for which English has no near approximation.</p>
<p>Translation is, as Barbara Johnson writes, “an exercise in violent approximation.” And yet it can also be a site of creativity, where an author and a translator meet, and, in doing so, generate something between them that is new. I have attempted to follow Bachmann’s call to move within her text without displacing myself. My hope is for readers of this short excerpt to do the same.</p>

","<p>Ingeborg Bachmann (1926 –1973) was an Austrian poet and author. The daughter of an early Nazi party member, Bachmann’s work grapples with the imperialist, antisemitic, racist, and sexist ideologies of the party as part of German language. While studying for her doctorate in philosophy, she became an influential voice in literary circles, publishing widely in the fields of literature and philosophy. She also contributed to the growing salon culture, like that of Group 47 in Vienna. In what was and is a largely male dominated, post-war German literary world, she published her first volume of poetry, <em>Die gestundete Zeit</em> (<em>Time on Loan</em>). After moving to Rome in the summer of 1953, she published her second volume of poetry, <em>Anrufung des Großen Bären</em> (<em>Invocation of the Great Bear</em>). In 1965, she became the first woman to win the Georg Büchner Prize. Bachmann died in Rome, in October of 1973, at the age of forty-seven, after an apartment fire. One of her translators, Gabriel Annan, writes that Bachmann is “fiendishly difficult” to render in another language due to the intricate philosophical implications of the way she plays with words.</p>","<p>Ailie Margot studies medieval Christian mysticism and letter writing.

","I shriek in anguish for the boy severed from my soul—
Suddenly his home is in the expanse
I am in great pain for him —
— Please, just let me take me his place —

My heart left me when I saw Jacob, dead,
Carried upon his bearers’ arms.
On this earth, other than they,
None have been seen
Burying a star in the dust.

I brace my heart again and again,
That it might quiet down and settle in place.
My right hand is upon it. Perhaps it will slacken,
But then I won’t hold back.

Tears stream from my searing heart,
Which has been rent twelvefold.
Now I must weep unrestrained
For my precious son, my beloved child.

How can my heart last — so I find rest — in my life
— after him — on this earth?
And how can I find comfort without his face,
When his name and memory are all I desire?
Jacob’s name is lost — and yet
A sprout of his loss still thrives inside.
I try to weep it away, and yet it grows —
For a sprout flourishes when quenched.

True, to me, the Earth is like a tight stopper.
To my eyes, my house is like a prison.
But I will never fear Fate again, for
In your death, my son, every fear came to pass.

On the day Jacob was taken,
The sound of my harp turned to mourning.
May that day seize darkness!
May that evil, bitter day be lost!
","<p>These eight Hebrew epigrams are about the death of Moses Ibn Ezra’s son, or sons. The order of their composition is unknown, and it is unclear if they are about one or multiple losses. I decided to arrange these translations in a way that narrates a journey through grief after the death of a child. I placed the first poem about sudden loss in the beginning, and then followed it with the epigram about attending the son’s funeral. The next four epigrams portray a parent inundated with intense waves of emotion released by weeping. The final two epigrams convey a sense of deep sorrow whose rawness has subsided due to the passage of time.</p>
<p>The spare, compact, and sometimes obscure Hebrew makes these poems difficult to translate. The verses are laden with biblical references, difficult constructions, and experiments with language. Like other Hebrew Andalusi poets, Moses Ibn Ezra’s verse was written in the style of medieval Arabic poetry. I needed to consult a number of resources, including a scholarly commentary, a range of Hebrew and Arabic dictionaries, and of course the Hebrew Bible.</p>
<p>The wordplay at the end of each epigram is almost completely lost in translation. In the original Hebrew, the differences in meanings and syntactical shifts induce a sense of surprise at a radical change. I believe that this effect mirrors the horrible sense of shock and disbelief when hearing of a relative’s sudden death. I tried to arrange these translations in a way that captures this cataclysmic paradigm shift.</p>
<p>I would like to thank my colleague and friend Ori Kinberg, a doctoral student in Hebrew literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, whose comments on my translations were indispensable.</p>
","<p>Medieval Hebrew poetry in al-Andalus (Islamic Spain) from the eleventh and twelfth centuries is an exciting fusion of biblical language and Arabic literary style. Moses Ibn Ezra (c. 1055-after 1138) was the third of the four great medieval Hebrew poets during that time. After coming of age among the Jews under the Zirid dynasty in Granada, he received a rabbinic education in the yeshiva (house of Jewish study) in Lucena. Like his educated contemporaries, he wrote both secular and liturgical poetry. In his secular poetry, Ibn Ezra is considered the most conservative of the medieval Hebrew poets because of his strict adherence to Arabic literary conventions. In his youth, he composed the <em>Sefer ha-’Anaq</em> (<em>Book of the Necklace</em>), a work of epigrams which demonstrates his mastery of the <em>badī’</em>, or classical Arabic poetic ornamentation. His <em>Dīwan</em> (poetry collection) contains many genres of medieval Hebrew verse, including wine, panegyric, complaint, love and friendship, and contemplation. After the Berber Almoravid conquest of al-Andalus in1090, Moses Ibn Ezra fled the kingdom of Granada and wandered in exile in Christian-ruled Northern Spain. There he wrote two Judeo-Arabic works, one on the use of biblical metaphor, and the other on Hebrew poetics.</p>","<p>Ben Notis is a doctoral student in the University of Pennsylvania’s department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations. His dissertation focuses on Hebrew poetry written during an exciting time of Jewish-Muslim interaction in al-Andalus (Islamic Spain) in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. He hopes to explore lyrical complaints about physical and mental breakdowns, betrayal and abuse, separation from friends and lovers, and the vicissitudes of Time. His other interests include medieval Arabic poetry, the histories of madness and emotions, and the cultural history of the human body. A graduate of Brandeis’s Near Eastern and Judaic Studies department in 2017, he came to Penn after a series of odd jobs including farming, Bar Mitzvah tutoring, and book editing. When not studying, he enjoys visiting his nephews and baking.

sin-titulo,Sin título,Without a title,Rosalía de Castro,James Mesiti,"Una sombra tristísima, indefinible y vaga
Como lo incierto, siempre ante mis ojos va
Tras de otra vaga sombra que sin cesar la huye,
Corriendo sin cesar.
Ignoro su destino…mas no sé por qué temp
al ver su ansia mortal,
que ni han de parar nunca, ni encontrarse jamás.","A melancholic and indefinable shadow, blurry
like all that is uncertain, before my eyes always follows
another blurry shadow that without rest tries to escape,
running restlessly.
Its destiny I ignore… but I am not sure why I am scared 
upon seeing such mortal longing
as they must never stop, nor ever meet.","<p>When translating the work of Rosalía de Castro, two of the most difficult — albeit most important — qualities are the ambiguity and musicality in which her verses and poetic subjects operate. Spanish allows for ambiguity and wordplay that must be defined when translating into English. One of the first challenges to this respect was the use of the neuter noun “lo incierto” in the second verse. The options were changing “lo incierto” from a noun to an additional adjective, “uncertain” specifically, perhaps by applying it to the previous phrase: “A melancholic, indefinable, and uncertain shadow.” I chose to keep the grammatical syntax of the verse as is but introduced the noun/adjective pairing of “all is ambiguous.” This struggle with the intentional ambiguity of Castro was also present in the second to last verse and the possessive adjective of “su.” The translation of this word to “such,” while ridding the verse of its possessive qualities, maintains a level of ambiguity as to who, or which shadow, the “mortal longing” refers to without having to make a creative decision on the matter. Difficulties with Castro’s lyrical fluidity and musicality manifest themselves in a similar manner. The second to the fourth verses were particularly challenging in this regard. For example, the repetition of “sin cesar” in the third and fourth together with the alliteration of the “c” required a compromise in order to maintain the fluidity of the text while sacrificing a direct repetition of “without rest.” A more exact translation of “sin cesar” may have been “without stopping” or “incessantly.” However, this would have made it perhaps impossible to translate the employed alliteration.</p> 
<p>Maintaining these characteristics were the two main priorities of this translation, which may have provoked other sacrifices. Rosalía de Castro is known for being a precursor to free verse poetry for the time period in which she was writing. This being said, while there tends to be irregularities from one verse to the next in terms of metric, there may be intention to what her metrics were even though they do not match from verse to verse. This translation does not follow any metric and is in complete free verse.</p> 
","<p>Rosalía de Castro (Feb. 23, 1837 – July 15, 1888) hails from Santiago de Compostela, Spain. There are not many documents in regard to her early life. However, it is known that her father José Martínez Viojo was a priest and thus could not recognize her as his daughter. Her mother, Teresa de Castro, was a member of high Galician society and was thus forced to keep her birth clouded in secrecy. As such, for much of Rosalía de Castro’s early infant life, she was cared for by her paternal aunts away from Santiago before returning to live with her birth mother. She would come to develop a close relationship with her that would later inspire some of her poetic work. In 1858, she married Manuel Murguía, with whom she had seven children. Their marital history, like much of the life of de Castro, is uncertain and contradictory in terms of opinions among academics. It is partly assumed that the marriage was not founded in love, but was sought by de Castro as a means of establishing legitimacy due to the circumstances that surrounded her birth. However, it is known that Murguía changed the order and format of some of the poems in <em>En las orillas del Sar</em> (1884), the poetry book where this translation comes from, with the intention of partially shielding de Castro from criticism which she may have received from the church, particularly when considering her existentialism and lyrical questioning of death. Prior and in addition to <em>En las orillas del Sar</em>, de Castro’s earlier books <em>Cantares Gallegos</em> (1863) and <em>Follas novas</em> (1880) were not published originally in Spanish but in Gallego. Based on her work and the biographical information that does exist, it is known that de Castro lived “indicada” and tormented, perhaps in part for not being able to be recognized by her father and what this meant for the rest of her life. De Castro is considered a precursor to poetic Modernism for her irregularities in terms of metric and, as stated, her existentialism. She has since enjoyed a mythification of her figure, not only in Spain but also in the greater Hispanic world.</p>","<p>James Mesiti, a native of Albany, New York, is a researcher and poet.

palik-tik-daina-man,Palik Tik Dainą Man,Leave Me Only A Song,Paulius Širvys,Ash Maria,"Girdėjau tavo atdūsį
Kaip dainą iš toli. 
Daireis, kažką praradusi
Baltam dienų kely.
Šaukiau tave — neatmeni.
Neatmeni — nereik.
Apeik mane kaip akmenį,
Kaip mirusį apeik.
Ir eik tu sau, kaip einama
Mylėti pirmąsyk. 
Palik, palik tik dainą man,
Tik ilgesį palik.","I heard how you breathe 
As though a song far out. 
You looked around for something bereaved
On the days’ white route. 

I called out to you… no recollection.
Recollect you… don’t need to. 
Pass me — a stone’s reflection, 
As if dead, pass me through. 

And go the way, in which you belong
To experience love on its eve.
Leave, leave me only a song, 
Only the longing I want you to leave.","<p>Before translating Paulius Širvys, I had made an intentional effort to avoid any attempt at translating Lithuanian poetry. Lithuanian has an incredibly rich catalog of intransitive verbs, alongside highly productive morphology, which leads to countless considerations that the translator must mull over. For the sake of capturing the poem’s rhythm and feeling, nuances must be removed. To illustrate this point, I will explain the layers in the Lithuanian word <em>besitrindamos</em>. The root of the word is <em>-trin-</em> which comes from the verb trinti meaning “to rub.” <em>-si-</em> is the reflexive affix. <em>Be-</em> is a prefix to denote that the action is happening for an indefinite amount of time. <em>-damos</em> is the feminine plural half-participle suffix to denote that the action is taking place in tandem with another. A long-winded, yet still insufficient, translation of besitrindamos might be “while rubbing against one another for some time.”</p>
<p>Luckily, this poem did not include any words that were so complex, though there were still plenty of difficult decisions that I had to make. In the second and fourth lines of the poem, Širvys creates a linguistic harmony through the usage of <em>dainą</em> and <em>dienų</em>, meaning “song” and “day” respectively. Unfortunately, I was unable to find any way to recreate this harmony using the same simple language. This original poem also takes advantage of colloquialisms to reduce Lithuanian’s sesquipedalian morphology. This most often occurs with verb endings. For example, in formal Lithuanian it would be <em>daireisi</em> not <em>daireis</em> in line three, and <em>baltame</em> instead of <em>baltam</em> in line four. Again, I was unable to recreate this effect. In lines five and six, Širvys writes the same word, <em>neatmeni</em>, with the meaning of “you don’t remember.” For the sake of finding an equivalent rhyme in English in line seven, I had to make a slight departure from the original’s consistency.</p>
<p>When sharing my translation with a Lithuanian writer friend, the last line was where they had their only reservation with it. In Lithuanian, the word <em>palik</em> is the imperative form of <em>palikti</em> meaning “to abandon/leave behind or in its current state,” but just writing “leave,” as my friend suggested, felt too ambiguous. Therefore, I had to affix the words “I want you to” in order to make it more clear. My heart also sank when I read this line for the first time, as I came across the word <em>ilgesys</em>, which does not have a direct translation in English. It is similar to the concepts of <em>saudade</em> in Portuguese and <em>toska</em> in Russian, but nonetheless the concept is deeply rooted in Lithuanian culture and history. From conversations with Lithuanian friends, the best way I can describe <em>ilgesys</em> is as the following: “an unsettled, arcane longing for a time, place, or person forever out of reach.” In the contemporary Lithuanian conscious, <em>ilgesys</em> is often understood in reference to the idealized free Lithuania of the interwar years.</p>

 

","<p>Paulius Širvys (1920 – 1979) was a popular Lithuanian poet and journalist who spent his childhood in a free Lithuania, but his adult life entirely under occupation. After the death of his parents and brother at an early age, Širvys was placed in an orphanage. He pursued the life of a rural farmer until the beginning of World War II, when he moved to Vilnius to receive military training. While serving, he was able to survive despite twice being captured by the Nazis. However, in 1944, he was badly injured as a combatant in the Red Army. A decade after the war, he devoted his energy to writing, serving as editor for the Lithuanian Writers’ Union’s magazine <em>Literatūra ir menas</em> (<em>Literature and Art</em>). He then studied at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow. In 1973, he received the Lithuanian SSR State Prize for his poem <em>Ilgesys – ta giesmė</em> (<em>Longing is this Song</em>).</p>
 
<p>He is no longer a household name in Lithuania today, but in literary circles he is still considered to be one of the most important writers of the Soviet period. In 1995, a poetry award (Paulius Širvio literatūrinė premija) was founded in his honor. Like other Soviet artists, his early works were in the socialist realist style and were largely concerned with issues of war. His later works were much more romantic, with the Lithuanian concept of ilgesys being a common focal point of this style of writing. The poems from this period have an intimate levity through the frequent usage of alliteration and parallelism, in addition to a disposition for Lithuanian folk imagery and language.</p>","<p>Ash Maria is a first-generation college student double-majoring in anthropology and Russian and Eastern European studies at Pomona College. Despite entering college monolingual, at Pomona he was able to study Eastern Armenian, French, German, Lithuanian, Portuguese, and Russian. They spent the last summer living in Vilnius, Lithuania, where they completely fell in love with the Lithuanian language and realized that they wanted to spend their career studying and translating its literature. He has also published poetry translations of Anton Ochirov’s work from Russian and translated for the independent media outlet <em>Meduza</em>. They are currently applying to Ph.D. programs in both comparative literature and Slavic studies.

der-erlkonig,Der Erlkönig,The Elm-King,Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,Benjamin McAvoy-Bickford,"Wer reitet so spät durch Nacht und Wind?
Es ist der Vater mit seinem Kind:
Er hat den Knaben wohl in dem Arm,
Er fasst ihn sicher, er hält ihn warm.

»Mein Sohn, was birgst du so bang dein Gesicht?«
»Siehst, Vater, du den Erlkönig nicht?
Den Erlenkönig mit Kron’ und Schweif?«
»Mein Sohn, es ist ein Nebelstreif.«

»Du liebes Kind, komm, geh mit mir!
Gar schöne Spiele spiel’ ich mit dir;
Manch’ bunte Blumen sind an dem Strand,
Meine Mutter hat manch gülden Gewand.«

»Mein Vater, mein Vater, und hörest du nicht,
Was Erlenkönig mir leise verspricht?«
»Sei ruhig, bleibe ruhig, mein Kind:
In dürren Blättern säuselt der Wind.«

»Willst, feiner Knabe, du mit mir gehn?
Meine Töchter sollen dich warten schön;
Meine Töchter führen den nächtlichen Reihn
Und wiegen und tanzen und singen dich ein.«

»Mein Vater, mein Vater, und siehst du nicht dort
Erlkönigs Töchter am düstern Ort?«
»Mein Sohn, mein Sohn, ich seh es genau:
Es scheinen die alten Weiden so grau.«

»Ich liebe dich, mich reizt deine schöne Gestalt;
Und bist du nicht willig, so brauch ich Gewalt.«
»Mein Vater, mein Vater, jetzt fasst er mich an!
Erlkönig hat mir ein Leids getan!«

Dem Vater grauset’s, er reitet geschwind,
Er hält in Armen das ächzende Kind,
Erreicht den Hof mit Mühe und Not:
In seinen Armen das Kind war tot.

<h1>Erlkönigs Tochter</h1>
<h2><em>Johann Gottfried von Herder</em></h2>

Herr Oluf reitet spät und weit,
Zu bieten auf seine Hochzeitsleut;

Da tanzen die Elfen auf grünem Land,
Erlkönigs Tochter reicht ihm die Hand.

»Willkommen, Herr Oluf! Was eilst von hier?
Tritt her in den Reihen und tanz mit mir.«

»Ich darf nicht tanzen, nicht tanzen ich mag,
Frühmorgen ist mein Hochzeittag.«

»Hör an, Herr Oluf, tritt tanzen mit mir,
Zwei güldne Sporne schenk ich dir.

Ein Hemd von Seide so weiß und fein,
Meine Mutter bleicht’s mit Mondenschein.«

»Ich darf nicht tanzen, nicht tanzen ich mag,
Frühmorgen ist mein Hochzeitstag.«

»Hör an, Herr Oluf, tritt tanzen mit mir,
Einen Haufen Goldes schenk ich dir.«

»Einen Haufen Goldes nähm ich wohl;
Doch tanzen ich nicht darf noch soll.«

»Und willt, Herr Oluf, nicht tanzen mit mir,
Soll Seuch und Krankheit folgen dir.«

Sie tät einen Schlag ihm auf sein Herz,
Noch nimmer fühlt er solchen Schmerz.

Sie hob ihn bleichend auf sein Pferd.
»Reit heim nun zu deinem Fräulein wert.«

Und als er kam vor Hauses Tür,
Seine Mutter zitternd stand dafür.

»Hör an, mein Sohn, sag an mir gleich,
Wie ist dein’ Farbe blaß und bleich?«

»Und sollt sie nicht sein blaß und bleich,
Ich traf in Erlenkönigs Reich.«

»Hör an, mein Sohn, so lieb und traut,
Was soll ich nun sagen deiner Braut?«

»Sagt ihr, ich sei im Wald zur Stund,
Zu proben da mein Pferd und Hund.«

Frühmorgen und als es Tag kaum war,
Da kam die Braut mit der Hochzeitschar.

»Sie schenkten Met, sie schenkten Wein;
Wo ist Herr Oluf, der Bräutigam mein?«

»Herr Oluf, er ritt in Wald zur Stund,
Er probt allda sein Pferd und Hund.«

Die Braut hob auf den Scharlach rot,
Da lag Herr Oluf, und er war tot.
","Who rides so late through night and wind?
The father with his lad: 
He has the young one in his arms,
He keeps him safe, well-clad.

“My son, what brings your look to fear?”
“You can’t see the Elm-King?
The Elm-King with his crown and tail?”
“My son, the mists just sing.”

“Beloved lad, come, go with me!
The games we’ll nicely play;
So many flowers on my shore,
And mother’s gold array.”

“My father, father, don’t you hear,
The Elm-King’s quiet deals?”
“Be calm, stay calm, my lad: it’s just
Dry leaves the wind reveals.”

“You want, young sir, to go with me?
My daughters wait there nigh;
My daughters lead the nightly waltz,
And dance a lullaby.”

“My father, father, don’t you see,
His daughters’ dark display?”
“My son, my son, well can I see,
Some willows old and gray.”

“I love your figure, teasing me,
You’ll see how I am strong.”
“My father, father, feel his touch!
The Elm-King does me wrong!”

The father, dreading, swiftly rides,
He holds his groaning son,
At last in need he reaches home:
His child’s life is done.

<h1>Elm-King's Daughter</h1>

""Sir Oluf rides both far and wide,
To tell them of his marriage-bride;

There dance the elves on verdant land,
The Elm-King’s daughter gave her hand.

“Come in, Sir Oluf! Must you flee?
Do stay to waltz and dance with me.”

“I must not dance, no dance I may,
Tomorrow morn’s my wedding day.”

“Sir Oluf, listen, dance with me,
Two golden spurs I’ll give to thee.

A silken shirt so fine and white,
My mother bleached it with moonlight.”

“I must not dance, no dance I may,
Tomorrow morn’s my wedding day.”

“Sir Oluf, listen, dance with me,
A golden hoard I’ll give to thee.”

“I’d take a golden hoard, it’s true;
Yet I must never dance with you.”

“You won’t, Sir Oluf, dance with me,
Let pox and illness follow thee.”

She dealt a blow unto his heart,
He felt a wound to deeply smart.

She helped him, pale, onto his horse.
“For your one, ride a homeward course.”

And as he reached his house’s door,
His mother, trembling, stood before.

“My son, do listen, tell me true,
What makes your face so pale and blue?”

“And should it not be pale and blue,
The Elm-King’s realm I did go through.”

“My son, do listen, my dear pride,
What should I now go tell your bride?”

“Just say I went into the grove
To let my horse and dog go rove.”

The day, by early morning, rose,
The bride came by in wedding clothes.

“They give the mead, they give the wine,
Oh where’s Sir Oluf, bridegroom mine?”

“Sir Oluf’s gone into the grove,
To let his horse and dog go rove.”

The bride was turning scarlet red,
There lay Sir Oluf, he was dead.
""","<p>“Der Erlkönig” has become one of Goethe’s most famous poems because it lends itself well to musical settings, of which one by Franz Schubert has become the most well-known. However, its long history of musical settings stretches from the first setting, by the actress, musician, and singer Corona Schröter, to Carl Loewe’s popular version, to more recent works such as Marc-André Hamelin’s “Étude No. 8 in B-Flat Minor”, “Erlkönig, after Goethe”. “Earl King” by the Carolina Chocolate Drops also deserves note as a recent, and quite good, musical reworking of this scene. Some of the reasons that this poem calls out to musicians is in its strong sense of rhyme and a continual forward movement of the action, which I attempted to imitate in my English rendering by setting it to one of the meters typical of a ballad.</p> 
         
<p>Furthermore, this suits the history of the poem; Goethe was inspired by the Danish ballad “Elveskud”, also called “Elverskud” and an interpretation of the ballad by Johann Gottfried Herder, the second poem translated here. The title of  “Erlkönigs Tochter”, or “Elm-King’s Daughter”, seems more common to me than the alternate title of “Herr Oluf.” The Herder poem has a similar musicality, since it was only lightly adapted from the original source material in the process of translation. I chose to render it in a different meter common among ballads and hymns that better suited the rhythm of its lines.</p> 
        <p>However, Herder’s translation differs significantly from the source text in one way: It discusses the “Erlkönig”, or alder-king, instead of the elf-king found in the earlier Danish ballad. Although a common approach in English is to simply render “Erlkönig” as erl-king, I found this unsatisfying because it destroys the history and meaning of the original. Three things, to me, are important about the “Erl” in “Erlkönig”: The way it sounds, its meaning of referring to an alder, and how it was supposed to initially refer to elves. I found that a translation of elm-king preserved the sound symbolism, connected it with trees, and resembled the word elf-king.</p> 
         
<p>I also sought to preserve the different but interlinked feels of the two poems. Goethe’s version takes its time elucidating every line, but the poem progresses quickly and straightforwardly to the inevitable end. The lines of Herder do not force the reader to slow down as much, but instead the poem circles back again and again with its chorus. Ultimately, I decided to balance the need to preserve that character with the limits of a literal translation. The translation that I settled on isn’t wholly literal but tries to be literal when possible and strictly abides by line divisions. I also left some archaisms that seemed to want to sneak into the Herder poem stand, which helped preserve its folk-esque origins while giving me additional freedom to stick to my self-imposed metrical scheme.</p>","<p>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749 – 1832) is arguably the most famous author to ever make use of the German language. Besides his poetry, he served as an adviser in the Weimar Court and wrote numerous novels, plays, scientific works, and articles. Although he can’t neatly be grouped into any one literary movement, he was influenced by the Sturm und Drang movement early on in his career and was a major influence on burgeoning German Romanticism. Goethe also studied the Quran and Islamic literature more generally, an influence demonstrated in his “West-östlicher Divan.” Goethe’s esteem in Germanic literary culture is so high that the government-supported foundation for the German language abroad is called the Goethe-Institut.

<p>Johann Gottfried von Herder (1744 –1803) was a friend of Goethe, although their relationship did not last. He became a notable poet and critic in his own right, and was also supported by the work of the Weimar Court. Similarly to Goethe, his work is influenced by both the neoclassical style of Weimar and the Sturm und Drang movement. His views helped give rise to later German nationalistic movements, although he was also a supporter of the French Revolution and generally expressed complex and sometimes confusing views on political matters.</p>","<p>Benjamin McAvoy-Bickford is a first-year student at the University of Pennsylvania from Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

I felt dry grass graze the back of my knees and the roughness of marula bark on my fingertips. And I learned the way our curly black hair glows like gold springs under the gleam of the sun. Memories, before words, were the first love letters eSwatini sent to
me, inscribed on the joys and mysteries of early childhood.</p>

<p><em>Yebo</em> (Yes)</p>
<p><em>Sawubona</em> (Hello)</p>
<p><em>Make</em> (Mother)</p>
<p><em>Kwasukasukela</em> (Once upon a time)</p>

<p>My mother taught me my first siSwati words and my first English words. I began to search for language––the right words, and how to say them–– as my world began to expand and then enclose over Coquitlam, British Columbia, a city where I have never met another Swazi outside of my family. In the classroom, seeking siSwati was impossible. In books, on chalkboards, and in conversations, French and English were all I could find. English cast its veil over almost everything.</p>

<p>My search for the right words has failed many times. It failed the first time I tried to order a meal on my own, explain “where I’m really from,” and answer the question “tell me about yourself”. It failed almost every class discussion and during many awkward introductions. Lost in my own jumbled silence, I’d wish I were someplace else. Somewhere between Malkerns, my imagination, and the boundless evergreen forest behind my childhood home. In this place of dreams, my voice wavered seamlessly between the languages of my ancestors and my classmates. Back in Coquitlam, I felt eSwatini receding further and further away. The feeling of Gogo’s flowers on my fingertips was thwarted by that of pointing out a tiny unlabeled country on a laminated map and saying I’m ‘from there’ and not being able to go back there for 16 years and counting. No one around me knew what eSwatini was and began to wonder if I really knew either.</p>

<p>eSwatini came back to me in small ways. At first, in a neon yellow polyethylene bag, littered with perfectly spaced magenta squares that converge at the center. Inside lay wrinkled corn puffs in a fluorescent orange, covered in millions of cheese dust particles. Every time my mom or my Gogo visited Eswatini, they brought back the popular South African snack Nik Naks. They were my absolute favorite chip, the perfect balance of maize, cheese, and crunch. And they were the perfect way to share something Swazi with my classmates. “Like Cheetos but better” was my opening line. Tasty and tangible. I found comfort in Nik Naks’ explicit, Swazi-imported existence. I hoped to transfer some of this clarity into my own Swazi identity.</p>

<p><em>Lutsandvo</em> (love)</p>
<p><em>Bantfwana</em> (children)</p>
<p><em>Umndeni</em> (family)</p>
<p><em>Ngikukhumbulile</em> (I miss you)</p>

<p>siSwati echoed through the air when my mother spoke to relatives on the phone or to my Gogo when she visited us every few years. Besides a word here and there, I couldn’t understand most Swati conversations. But I could still listen to the sound of the language: the way my mothers’ voice shifted tone many times in a single word, the sharp release of the ‘c’ click in ngiyacabanga (I think) and lucingo (telephone). The rhythmic dance between short and long syllables. How the interjections of English words in Swati conversation sounded like the British actors in Pride and Prejudice. If I listened close enough, I felt love breathed into every sound. Lutsandvo that reached far beyond the Atlantic Ocean, the phrases I couldn’t understand, and the two-thousand dollar plane ticket back to Mbabane.</p>

<p>I found more of Eswatini over dinner. Once a week, we’d eat baked chicken, mashed potatoes, and peas that I’d push to the sides of my plate. Sometimes, stories from her childhood accompanied my favorite meals. As I bit into spicy chicken, she’d be in the Swazi countryside on the weekends, helping tend to her grandfather’s dairy farm in Malkerns. The farm’s vast plain of green doubled as a stage she’d sing her favorite songs on, with the animals, the grass, and her cousins as the only audience. In the farm fields existed a portal to an infinite number of worlds. In the fields, she could be in Mbabane. Or she could be the newest member of the Fantastic Four, using the power of invisibility to defeat humanity’s greatest enemy yet. For the both of us, the outdoors was a place of childhood dreams, where tall branches and leaves of various shades of green shielded us from the confines of worldly realities. For years at a time, memories and our imaginations were the only way back home. By the time I finished my mashed potatoes, my mother had moved across the world at 19 to pursue an education and new opportunities in Canada.</p>

<p><em>Nosizwe</em> (Mother of Nations)</p>

<p>In Coquitlam, in Philadelphia, and in every state or province in between, I’ve still never met another Swazi outside of my family. I can’t say most things I want to say in the language of my ancestors and sometimes, I still can’t find the right words to say what I want to say in English.</p>

<p>But I’ve found stories and memories that I hold deep in my heart, irrespective of time or distance. I can hold photographs or Nik Naks or dictionaries between my fingertips and I can hear my Mom and my Gogo speak in siSwati. And I have myself. I am a Swazi of the Ndwandwe clan in Canada, in the United States, during my childhood, and in my dreams. What I’ve lost and found has always been with me. And will remain when I once again watch the sunset light Malkerns sky on fire.</p>","<p>Aiyana Nosizwe Mate is an undergraduate student pursuing a bachelor’s in Anthropology from the

鶴巢松樹遍，人訪蓽門稀。 
綠竹含新粉，紅蓮落故衣。
渡頭煙火起，處處採菱歸。 ","In solitude I silently closed 
The brushwood lattice-gate, facing
The setting sun whose shine is as vast
and boundless as this moment. 

As the cranes have found themselves homes 
Everywhere
in the pine trees,
Visitors seldom come to my grass-woven door. 

Bamboos of green are newly coated
by a thin layer of powders, 
while the lotuses of red 
have just peeled her old dress. 

Smoke and flames are looming out of the darkness
from the ferry afar, 
enveloping the silhouettes of the ladies upon their return
from harvesting water-chestnuts. 
","<p>I always begin my translation process by trying to sense in my mind what the poet sensed in the moment when the poem was written. I use my imagination to reconstruct and to repaint for myself the picture that the poet sees in nature and paints; I imagine the light and heat in the moment, the brightness and transparency of the air before me, the coolness of the evening wind surrounding me. Due to my passion for remembering and enlivening the experiences of the five senses, the mood, and the sentiments at the moment, I try my best to restore and translate into English what I feel in the Chinese poem. The title, “impromptu verses,” is translated from <span lang=""zh"">即事</span>, which adds a little “musicality” into the simple action of “jotting down things.” Since my goal is to evoke the reader’s sensations and sentiments and put them in the precise moment that the poet was experiencing while he wrote the poem, I selected words that emphasize colors and smell, such as “smoke and flames,” “green,” and “red.” One phrase that I struggled a bit to translate was <span lang=""zh"">蒼茫</span>, which I translated into “vast and boundless” — a spatial dimension that accentuates the hollowness and nothingness of the space called <span lang=""zh"">天地</span>, namely the infinite space between the firmament and earth. By doing so, the English reader may experience a moment when the light from the sunset permeates and gilds everything in the universe, even though the night is looming ahead.</p>","<p>Wang Wei (<span lang=""zh"">王維</span>, 701 – 761) was a poet, painter, and government official. He was born during the glorious Tang Dynasty or Prosperous Kaiyuan Era (<span lang=""zh"">開元盛世</span>), under the rule of Tang Xuanzong (Emperor Xuanzong of Tang; <span lang=""zh"">唐玄宗</span>). The poet also witnessed the An Lushan Rebellion (<span lang=""zh"">安史之亂</span>) during his lifetime. The color imagery in Wang Wei’s poetry is vivid, almost like a painting. The vivid colors in Wang Wei’s poems may suggest that he was inspired by the life-affirming philosophy of Chan (<span lang=""zh"">禪</span>) (the Japanese adaptation of Chan, more widely known to the Western audiences as Zen Buddhism). This would explain much of Wang Wei’s ardent wishful thinking.</p>","<p>Yudi Xie is a poet, a fervent talker, one who dreams in Chinese and writes her philosophy, literature, and history essays in English.

First, practice Buddhism every day.
Second, preserve Thai traditions; that’s the way.
Third, listen to your parents and teachers.
Fourth, always speak with good cheer.
Fifth, be grateful to the older ones.
Sixth, work hard until it’s all done.

The Royal Thai government wanted to celebrate Children’s Day and organize an annual Children’s Day Fair to promote children’s rights. The Royal Thai Government also wanted to localize the concept of Children’s Day to fit Thai culture. So, Cha-um Phanchaphan wrote “Children’s Duties” as a set of principles for children to follow, and Euah Sunthornsanan composed the music. Later, the Suntaraporn Band started playing it, and it has become a song played on Children’s Day in Thailand since 1959. The song has had a strong influence on Thai children’s literature — the third value mentioned in the song, ‘listen to your parents and teachers’, has become a prominent theme of many Thai children’s books.</p>","<p>Cha-um Panchaphan, also known as Cha-um Yaem-ngam, is a Thai author, poet, novelist, and songwriter.

In her free time, she wrote song lyrics regarding love, patriotism, the monarchy, and nature. She composed more than one hundred songs. In 2003, the Thai Writers Association gave her the Narathip Award to honor her great work and contribution to Thai literature.  Cha-um Panchaphan took part in organizing the 1959 Children’s Day Fair. The Royal Thai Government wanted her to write “Children’s Duties” as the theme song for Children’s Day and to remind Thai children of their filial duties.</p>","<p>John Viano and Peeriya Pongsarigun are authors and translators who excel in creating English language rhyme schemes which echo that of their sources, while accurately communicating the author’s message.

don’t break this net tied around me.
My whole life, I have tried to get out of it.
I’m familiar with the thorns bound to it,
but all of these thorns have grown witnessing death.

I laid down with a hand caressing their hair.

that mouth of theirs has become sharp.

Listen, 
I beg of you, do listen.
I don’t have any need for flowers.

What will I do with flowers?

Listen,
I’m begging you.
Listen, don’t cut my net.
Just leave me be.
I find great comfort
within this net, my friend!

I understand through living within it.
Where are they outside, 
the hard times of this age?

Come on, distance yourself.
The many-mouths of the net’s teeth
are doing well in my liver.
If, while biting the net, they break within me, 
then don’t ask what will happen.

Broken thorns cause ample pain.","<p>Translating <span lang=""hi"">जाल</span> was, more than anything, an exercise in patience — clearing the straits of my lack of expertise in reading Devanagari script and the poet’s extensive use of metaphor and imagery that, often, proved difficult to understand as a non-native Hindi speaker.</p>

<p>I began by transferring the poem from Devanagari to a phonetic version in Latin script. I learned Hindi by listening, and being able to link words to sound proved the most effective method of finding meaning in the text. From there I translated the poem literally, then adjusted the language of my translation to account for Sachdev’s tone and my interpretation of her intentions.</p>

<p><span lang=""hi"">जाल</span> is a poem meant to be read out loud; Hindi poetry has a wonderful lyrical quality, rhythmic and rich on the tongue. This musicality falls flat in a language like English, whose semantics and phonetics lend themselves to harder, shorter consonants and singular meaning. To remedy this, I focused on enhancing the poem’s emotional aspect through my use of diction.</p>

<p>I chose to preserve much of the poem’s structure, placing line breaks and stanzas in similar places; however, I also added capitalization — a feature that Hindi lacks completely — and punctuation where it didn’t exist prior for stylistic purposes. While the original can be read with minimal punctuation, almost intuitively, the same transitions between thoughts read much less naturally in English. However, while I sought to keep the structure similar, preserving the meaning in the same direct way was much more difficult. Many phrases are untranslatable, or can be translated multiple ways.</p>

<p>For example, <span lang=""hi"">सुनो तो सही</span>, a line that I translated as “do listen,” has no English equivalent. In its original form, it evokes a sense of both invitation and desperation, as if the poet is beseeching an unhearing stranger or seeking company between the bars of a jail cell. Similarly, <span lang=""hi"">कलेजे</span> can be translated as both heart and liver. I chose liver for the gruesome, honest tone it lends to the poet’s narrative, while heart would have alluded in some ways to a romance that the text doesn’t contain.</p>

<p>Rather than accuracy, I sought to capture the poem’s emotional essence — the poet’s clinging to familiar pain, her simultaneous self-destruction and consumption of that which traps her.</p>","<p>A poet and novelist hailing from India, Padma Sachdev (April 17, 1940 – August 4, 2021) is widely acknowledged as the first modern female poet to write in Dogri — an Indo-Aryan language native to India’s Jammu district. She also wrote extensively in Hindi, Urdu, and Punjabi.</p>

<p>Known for her lyrical, often deeply personal verse, she is regarded as a luminary of Dogri culture, evoking in her readers the beauty and nostalgia of their language — and of their nation. Through her intimate descriptions of mundane life, her own emotional turmoil, and the lands she was raised on, Sachdev’s love for her heritage is evident.</p>

<p>In India, Sachdev is celebrated among the nation’s most prominent female poets and contributors to Indian literature, and her death was regarded as a loss for her home state of Jammu and Kashmir. She was awarded the Padma Shri, India’s fourth-highest civilian honor, for her work.</p>

<p>Sachdev also received the Sahitya Akademi award for her collection <span lang=""hi"">मेरी कविता मेरे गीत</span> (My Poems, My Songs), a work which inspired Hindi poet and freedom fighter Ramdhari Singh Dinkar to declare, “After reading Padma’s poems, I felt I should throw my pen away—for what Padma writes is true poetry.”</p>","<p>Abigail Tuscano (b. 2005) is a high school junior from Texas, and a first-generation Indian-American born to immigrant parents from Maharashtra. A native speaker of Kadodi, an Indian dialect with eclectic roots in languages like Marathi and Konkani that contains loanwords from Portuguese, she is also working to learn Hindi, Urdu, and Spanish. Her loss of fluency in her heritage language at an early age — and the resultant loss of a cultural anchor — inspired her to turn to language-learning as a way of circling back to something akin to the voices and stories of her childhood.</p>",Hindi,hi,/assets/images/images_23/net.png,none,photo by Katherine Rozsypalek,,,,2023,submission,

quando non hai visto più niente
quando per qualche secondo
ti hanno spento la luce degli occhi.
Fissavi un punto impossibile del soffitto
e ti ho sentita andare via, camminare
sul muro, stringere la mano a un altro bene.
Poi sei tornata e non te n’eri accorta,
hai chiesto: sono a terra? e hai guardato me.
Sì, eri a terra, eri la mia terra
che tremava sotto ai piedi.
                                                        
E allora rispondi bene
a chi ti chiede come stai
e non vede l’inferno che ti scuote
non ti vede andare via di spalle.
Col tempo diventa tutto normale
tu dici che l’universo conosce
la strada più di te e che capita
a tanti e che c’è di peggio
c’è sempre di peggio.
Ma una parte di pianto resta
gonfia in mezzo al petto
una parte che si chiede perché
continuamente e non si rassegna
una parte che segna il sorriso
ferita negli occhi, una cosa 
che porterai su di te come un marchio
fino alla fine.
                                                        
Ti ho vista entrare in ospedale
Dea svenutaa
di tutte le sigarette fumate
e per mesi ho pensato
a quale sarebbe stata l’ultima parola
che ti avrei detto, quindi finivo
ogni frase con ti amo.
E oggi che il sole sembra
non farti più effetto
spero almeno ci sia
un sole più caldo di questo
che ti aspetta da qualche parte
nell’universo.
                                              
Ti ho telefonato
tutti i giorni per dieci anni
e ora che il tuo telefono squilla a vuoto
come potrò chiamarti?
Facendo scendere tutte le stelle
nel mio ufficio
aprendo la porta
del punto più chiaro del giorno
dove la tua voce è acqua
di ogni rubinetto, ogni fiume,
e dice: Valerio svegliati
come quando mi addormentavo
sul divano. Ora la tua voce
canta la canzone di Marinella
tra il vento degli alberi
e fa del mio cuore una marcia lenta.
                                                        
Rideremo di questi giorni
con le mani celesti
quando la testa ci esploderà
d’amore per il segreto delle cose.","I wonder what you saw
when you saw no more
when for a few seconds
they turned off the lights in your eyes.
You stared at an impossible spot in the ceiling
and I heard you leave, walk
on the wall, squeeze the hand of 
another love.
Then you returned and you hadn’t realized;
am I on earth? you asked. And you looked at me.
Yes, you were on earth. You were my earth,
trembling under my feet.
                                                     
And so you reply well
to those asking how are you
those who don’t see that hell is 
shaking you
do not see you leave behind their backs.
Over time it all becomes normal
you say the universe knows the
way better than you do and it happens
to many and there is worse
there is always worse.
But a piece of sorrow remains
swollen in the middle of the chest
a piece that continuously wonders 
why and does not subside 
a piece that marks the smile
wound in your eyes, something
you’ll take with you like a hallmark
till the end.

I saw you enter the hospital
fainted Goddess
of all the cigarettes you smoked
and for months I thought 
about the last word
I’d say to you, so I ended
every sentence with ti amo.
And today when the sun seems
to leave you indifferent
I hope that at least
a sun warmer than this
is waiting for you somewhere
in the universe. 

I telephoned you
every day for ten years
and now that your phone just rings out
how will I call you?
Making all the stars descend
into my office
opening the door
of the brightest point of day
where your voice is water
from every faucet, every river,
and it says: Valerio wake up
like when I fall asleep
on the couch. Now your voice
is singing the song of Marinella 
among the wind in the trees
and turns my heart into a slow march.

We will laugh of these days,
our hands azure,
when our heads will explode
out of love for the secret of things.","<p>These poems are excerpted from <em>Dammi tue notizie e un bacio a tutti</em> (<em>Send Me Your News and Kisses to All</em>), a raw and earnest collection in which the poet journeys through the death of his mother, Giulia, who died from cancer after a brief but fierce battle. Mother and son are warriors who, lightsabers in hand, fight against the incurable illness. The poet courageously explores the feelings provoked by this suffering, unafraid to name and experience even the most heartbreaking of them. The book, however, doesn’t speak only of grief and pain, but also of profound love, ardent hope, and eventually even a kind of happiness that, while not dismissing the pain of loss, reconciles it within life.</p>

<p>Firmly grounded in the grassroot origins of his poetic and artistic upbringing in anarchist and counterculture circles, Grutt brings together elements from Italian folk culture with echoes of Italy’s high poetic tradition of, for instance, Eugenio Montale. In his peculiar, down-to-earth yet highly lyrical style, Grutt does not shy away from exploring all corners of reality and human experience.</p>

<p>This collection is very close to me, because when I first read it I had recently discovered that I was pregnant with my second child. For the first time in my life when reading a book — <em>this</em> book — I identified with the mother rather than the child. Whenever the poet called out to his mother, I was the person being called, not the caller. That’s why I chose to keep the invocations in Italian; I felt that the sense of emotional urgency they convey would be weakened if translated into English. Moreover, while it is common for English speakers to use “I love you” both for parental and romantic relations, “ti amo” is generally used between lovers, and its use here for his mother heightens the intensity of the poet’s love. This book played such a crucial role in the development of my identity as a mother, woman, and human being, that I stayed with these poems and mulled over translations of them in my head for the following three years. As often happens, translating the text was a way of metabolizing the poetic experience, making it my own so that I could in turn offer it to English readers.</p> ","<p>Valerio Grutt is an Italian poet, musician, and visual artist. An anarchist at heart and eclectic by nature, he has experimented with a vast range of expressions involving words, music, and rhythm, from hip hop to copywriting to explorations of the healing powers of poetry. After a brief stint as the director of the University of Bologna’s Center for Contemporary Poetry (2013 to 2016), he has returned to a life of vagabond quests: “I am someone who is constantly searching, writing, creating...

for-kira,За Киру,For Kira,Alina Khaitlina,Yehudith Dashevsky,"<em>23 квітня, у переддень Великодня російська 
ракета влучила в житловий будинок в Одесі. 
Вбито 8 людей, поранено 18.
Серед загиблих — 3-місячна Кіра і її мати.</em>

<em>23 апреля, в преддверии Пасхи,
российская ракета попала в жилой дом в 
Одессе. Убито 8 людей, ранено 18. Среди 
погибших 3х-месячная Кира и ее мама.</em>

Как вы там говорите — скорей бы мира?
Коляска через ступеньку летит по лестнице.
Девочку из Одессы назвали Кира.
Кире было три месяца.

В три месяца начинают держать игрушку,
Учатся переворачиваться на спинку.
В три месяца человек похож на зверушку —
Белочку или свинку.

Улыбается маме, уставшей от вечных стирок,
Начинает другие лица вокруг учить.
Кирина мама погибла в Одессе с Кирой,
Теперь никто не сумеет их разлучить.

У мамы на запястье старая фенечка,
Сказали, что защитит. Видно, обманули.
У Киры в приданом — купальник размера ""феечка,""
Должна была примерить его в июле.

Как они там ""а давай напишем им 'с пасхой вас,'
Сейчас докурю и ракетку им в тыл закину.""
Жители ада выйдут, боясь испачкаться,
На дверях напишут:
""За Киру.""



","<em>On the 23rd of April [2022], just before Easter, a Russian rocket hit a civilian residence in Odessa. Eight people were killed, eighteen wounded. Among the dead were 3-month old Kira and her mother. </em>

What’s it called — let peace come quicker? 
The step, the stairs, where a stroller flies over —
In Odessa, there was a girl
who was three months old. Her name was Kira. 

At three months you might begin to teach her
to hold a toy, to learn to turn on her back.
At three months a person looks like a squirrel,
or a piglet — a small animal, a creature. 

She smiles at her mom, who’s exhausted 
from infinite laundry. She’s solving the quandary 
of other faces around her, but she can’t separate
from her mom now. Kira’s mom died in Odessa with Kira.

On the mom’s wrist was an old bauble, which they said 
would protect her. That turned out to be a con. 
Kira was about to inherit a fairy-sized swimsuit, 
which, in July, she was supposed to try on. 

So they were like — “Let’s send them a ‘Happy Easter!’
Gonna finish this smoke and blow their brains out with a rocket.”
The dwellers of hell will crawl out, afraid to get stained, 
and write on the door:
“For Kira.”","<p>The poem opens with an introduction in Ukrainian, with a Russian translation beneath it. The relationship Ukrainians have with the Russian language is complex. According to a survey from 2004, around 40% of Ukranians use Russian at home and between 70% and 90% understand the language, depending on the region. Despite the widespread use of Russian, the Ukrainian language is a flourishing one. A poll in 2012 showed that 50% of adult Ukranians consider their native language to be Ukrainian, around 30% consider it to be Russian, and around 20% consider both to be their native languages. I’m not an expert in the language policies in Ukraine, or how Ukranians feel about Russian, about whether they feel unjustly compelled to learn or use it, even now. I can guess how they might feel about the Russian jokes that portray Ukrainian as “crude” or “funny-sounding.” I will say that it is sad and not surprising that languages, such as Russian and Ukrainian, that are incredibly rich and developed in literature, poetry, music, and film,  only begin to be studied once there is a crisis.</p>

<p>The first phrase of this poem is “<em>Kak vi tam govorite?</em>” which is literally, “How do you say it there?” Is the “there” a veiled reference to the West, to the U.S., where it’s possible to have well-wishes about peace soon in Ukraine, but stay far removed from the actual war, from the remains of a three-month old flying over a staircase? Or is it simply an idiom, a casual way of saying “What’s it called?” I chose the latter, because it feels like more of an earworm phrase (as does the Russian), but am offering the former here as a possibility.</p>

<p>A place where I departed from the literal meaning for the sake of sound is in the stanza beginning with “At three months, you might begin to teach her.” The original is “At three months, [general, collective they] learn to turn on their back.” I wanted to add the rhyme back into the translation, so I added “teach her” at the beginning of the stanza to rhyme with “creature” at the end. A place where I chose a better-known phrase in English instead of the more literal original is “blow their brains out with a rocket” (the original reads “send a rocket at their backs”).</p> 

<p>In general, the original poem has a fairly regular rhyme pattern, not unusual for Russian language poetry, but also definitely not a given in contemporary Russian poetry. I wanted to convey some of that rhyming sound in the translation, especially because in some places the original Russian rhyme scheme feels silly. While not contrived in terms of sound, it feels as if the rhymes came first and the phrases after, as if there was nothing to say, so the poet tried some rhyming phrases. This is most felt in the fourth stanza, with the images of the bauble bracelet and the not-yet-tried-on bathing suit. It feels like a desperate and absurd attempt to say at least something about the mind-boggling waste the war made of these lives. Did the mom actually buy a protective bracelet that didn’t work? Was there really a bathing suit the baby did not have a chance to try on? Maybe. But it doesn’t really matter. The rhyme of the poem creates some accompanying drumbeat, a cradle of sound, for these images to live in.</p>","<p>Alina Khaitlina (b. 1987) is a poet and linguist born in 1987, and is from Leningrad, Russia. Formerly and well-known as Alya Kudryasheva, she became famous after posting some poems (especially her most well-known, “Mom is at the <em>dacha</em>, the key is on the table”) on her blog on <em>LiveJournal</em>. With the release of her first collection of poems in 2007, titled <em>It’s Open</em>, and which sold out its first print and was reprinted twice, she became one of the most read Russian language authors on <em>Livejournal</em>. What is unusual about Alina Khaitlina, and what the contemporary poetry world noticed, is that her poetry became known not just in the world of literary critics but among the general young population. Masses of followers in their twenties were reading her poetry and posting supportive comments on her blog. She is now known as one of the people who led to the revival of interest in poetry among Russian youth in the 2000s (poetry had gone out of style even in Russia at the time; it was seen as frivolous). Strikingly, she did not really consider herself a poet, even with her growing fame. She published academic work about poetry and sociolinguistics in the Russian deaf community and saw herself mostly as an academic, having moved to Germany for work in 2012. Yet, she is now considered one of the top “network poets” (a Russian category for poets who became famous on the internet) and has since been published in various anthologies, including one with COVID-themed poetry. Her second book of poems, <em>Sometimes Ships</em>, came out in 2016, and her book of poems for and about children, <em>Non-Fearful Cats</em>, came out in 2020.</p>","<p>Yehudith Dashevsky is a writer and translator living in Washington D.C. She currently works in development for the non-profit public health care and policy magazine, <em>Health Affairs</em>.

O Ziyâî, may the folk of this world not overly pine
For he — pistachio-lipped, almond-eyed — arrives
","<p>I wished to preserve some of the form of the ghazal because often only their meaning is translated which flattens them. This type of translation obscures much of the poets’ signature interplay of restriction and liberation. I preserved the <em>redif</em> (repeating word) while not attempting the <em>kafiye</em> (rhyme). To make up for the loss of rhyme, I played with internal rhyme in lines three and seven, introduced some word play in line six (“soul/solace”), and added alliteration in a few places. The addresses I kept as they are, including the <em>tehallus</em> (the poet’s self-naming). Müberra Gürgendereli, whose edition of Ziyâî I use, praised the poet’s relative simplicity of expression, so I strove for a measure of plainness. Still, I needed to indicate that this is a very refined verse that uses the full stylistic range of sixteenth-century Turkish. In line three, Ziyâî used two synonyms, <em>‘ahd</em> and <em>peymân</em>, of Arabic and Persian origins respectively, which I rendered into an old-fashioned native word and a medieval French borrowing.</p> 
<p>Turkish like Persian lacks grammatical gender. It has a single third-person singular pronoun instead of he or she, much like the singular they in English. The translation into a gendered language has to decide the gender of the beloved. I have imagined him as male to balance the constant feminization (and thus heterosexualization) in, for instance, an otherwise excellent Bosnian rendition of Ziyâî’s divan by Alena Ćatović. Related to this question of beloved’s gender is their or her or his ontological status: human or divine? Ghazals deal with both. Languages written in the Arabic script do not have capital letters, but those using Roman letters do, and can thus distinguish between a person and God. The beloved for me here is human and male, but of course he does not have to be.</p>","<p>Ziyâî (“The Illuminated”) of Mostar is the <em>mahlas</em> (pen name) of Hasan bin Ali bin Hüseyin bin Mahmûd bin Yûsuf el-Hersekî. He was well-educated, an accomplished calligrapher, and worked as a <em>katip</em> (cleric) and a <em>vaiz</em> (preacher). Only a single manuscript of his <em>divan</em> (collection of verse) survives, dating to April 1584, which is kept at the Selimiye Library in Edirne, Türkiye. It features a range of classical Ottoman poetic genres, 641 poems in total, including no fewer than 510 ghazals, of which fourteen are in Persian. Ziyâî also authored a <em>mesnevi</em> (narrative in verse) about Şeyh Abdürrezzâk who falls in love with a Christian in a dream and has many adventures before returning to Sufi Islam. Three manuscripts survive, two held in Istanbul and one in London. Ziyâî’s commentary on a <em>kaside</em> (long praise poem) by the classical Persian poet Sâdi of Shiraz is attested in one copy, now in the Historical Archive of Sarajevo. He died of the plague in Mostar in 1584/85. An early representative of divan poetry among the Bosnian Muslims, Ziyâî influenced many later Ottoman poets of his background. His verses were often featured in compilations or anthologies (<em>mecmua</em>) across Bosnia-Herzegovina.","<p>Denis Ferhatović (b. 1980) is a Bosnian-American scholar and writer, working and playing with English, French, Turkish, Indonesian, South Slavic microlanguages, and medieval Germanic and Romance languages. His essays, poems, translations, and co-translations have been published in <em>Rumba under Fire</em>, <em>Index on Censorship</em>, <em>The Riddle Ages</em>, <em>Iberian Connections</em>, and <em>Turkoslavia</em>.

sonnet,Soneto,Sonnet,Guillermo Blest Gana,Madison Weiss,"Si a veces silencioso y pensativo
a tu lado me ves, querida mía,
es porque hallo en tus ojos la armonía
de un lenguaje tan dulce y expresivo.
Y eres tan mía entonces, que me privo
hasta oír tu voz, porque creería
que rompiendo el silencio, desunía
mi ser del tuyo, cuando en tu alma vivo.
¡Y estás tan bella; mi placer es tanto,
es tan completo cuando así te miro;
siento en mi corazón tan dulce encanto,
que me parece, a veces, que en ti admiro
una visión celeste, un sueño santo
que va a desvanecerse si respiro!","If at times, thoughtful and silent
by your side you do see me,
it is because I discover in your eyes the harmony
of a most tender and affectionate language.
And you are so much mine, then, that I myself deprive
of even hearing your voice, because I fear
that in breaking the silence, my dear,
I split my being from yours, when in your soul I live.
And you are so beautiful, my pleasure is so great,
so complete when I look at you like this;
I feel in my heart such sweet enchantment,
that it seems, at times, as if in you I admire
a heavenly vision, a holy dream
that will vanish if I so much as breathe!","<p>The biggest challenge that I faced when translating this poem was deciding how to balance faithfulness to the structure versus the word choice. As a petrarchan sonnet, the original poem has a very exacting form in terms of rhyme scheme and meter; I did my best to preserve these elements while still being true to the language that the poet uses. I unfortunately found myself largely forced to abandon the technical elements of the poem in the name of creating something that sounded beautiful, not formulaic, in English. The language that Blest Gana uses is so subtly evocative, and English rhyme is so limited, that it was truly difficult to create a translation that could really be considered a translation and not a re-imagining or rewriting. For me, trying to translate “Soneto” was an exercise of putting myself into the poet’s head to decide how far I could stretch his work in any given direction without losing sight of it as a whole, missing the forest for the trees.</p>","<p>Guillermo Blest Gana was a Chilean writer born in 1829. Originally a law student, he fell ill and decided to pursue writing instead, publishing two works of lyrical poetry during his lifetime: <em>Poesías</em>, his first ever publication, which was inspired by the pain of losing his sister and the love he felt for his brothers, and, thirty years later, <em>Armonías</em>. During this time, his poetry shifted from romanticism, a style of which he is considered an exemplary author in Chile, to classicism. Between the release of these works, he was exiled from Chile as a political dissident, but he later returned. He continued writing in Santiago until his death in 1904, at which point his friend Antonio Orrego Barros assembled, edited, and published three volumes comprising his life’s work.</p>","<p>Madison Weiss is a senior at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, minoring in French and Spanish.

Let’s give him the milk, and offer him our souls. We go seeking liberation, gentle one. 
How fortunate we are, to sell milk 
and get Hari in return! 
We submit to him, the lotus-eyed.

could be greater than our profit 
from encountering Hari, my friend? 

Let’s return to the garden 
on the banks of the Yamuna to sell milk. With it, our devotion, just as pure. 
Come fast, hurry, my friend.","<p>The beauty of Kuvempu’s poetry truly lies in his ability to story-tell. He creates vivid scenes with simple characters that convey a fine divinity in his work. This poem is a lyrical one that describes two beautiful women — likely Gopikas — that seek the love and blessing of Lord Krishna. They plan to do so by selling milk at Brindavana, where the God is seen to be moving about along the banks of the river Yamuna. The poem itself has since been translated into a popularized song.</p>
<p>Lord Krishna has a myriad of incarnations and, therefore, names with which his devotees praise him. Kuvempu refers to him as Hari or Govinda, which I chose to maintain in certain parts of the poem. I characterize the deity with terms like the charmer, the lotus-eyed one — all reflections of the purity and playfulness Lord Krishna embodies.</p>
<p>It is challenging to translate certain words that encompass images and ideas as a whole — rannava, for example, can literally be translated to gemstones. But in essence, it is how they gleam under the sun, the milky glow of a pearl, the blood-like sparkle of a ruby. Likewise, Peetambara can be loosely translated to a dhoti, but it really is a description of its lustrous silk and gold-lined drapery. It is easily seen that there are no literal translations, given Kannada’s nuances and layered meanings.</p>
<p>Even the simple reference to the friend throughout this poem is delivered in many ways — like souymamukhi, the soft-faced, innocent one, or indhumukhi, one whose face resembles the moon. It is precisely why Kuvempu’s poetry — and any poem, for that matter — shines in a different light when kept in its intended form.
</p>","<p>Kuppali Venkatappa Puttappa (1904 –1994), known best under his pen name Kuvempu, was an Indian poet revered throughout the country for his many linguistic contributions to its rich literary history. His career included teaching and publishing poems, scripts, novels, essays, and more.</p> 
<p>Born in Karnataka, Kuvempu majored in Kannada at the Maharaja College of Mysore, graduating to become an academic lecturer at the same university. Along with his expertise in the Indian tongue, he entered the literary field with a collection of poetry in English. Regardless, Kuvempu wrote primarily in Kannada because of his firm belief that he could do more justice to his roots and society through native rather than foreign speech.</p> 
<p>He advocated extensively for students in Karnataka to be taught in Kannada as opposed to English, starting the Institute of Kannada Studies through Mysore University to further this cause. In addition, Kuvempu was vocal about societal change, advocating for the dismantling of gender inequality and such discrimination he perceived as dragging the nation down. To this day, his works are considered incredibly influential.</p> ","<p>Nesara Shree is a first-generation student with roots in Karnataka, India, where her parents were born and raised. Her family has extensively read and listened to musical renditions of Kuvempu’s poetry, an interest that inspired her to translate one of her favorites into English.</p>

<p>She speaks both Kannada and English at home, but cannot yet write or translate direct Kannada/Brahmic script, limited to the English alphabet spellings. She admires the softness of her language. She considers it poetry in itself to be able to preserve its effortless sweetness as it passes through the restricting sieve of another tongue.</p>

in silver, chaste and true,

spreads in our hearts like drops of morning dew.

norms are abolished, the present day destroyed,
the times revitalized. 

At her command arise the faded ghosts
of Pavane dancers, beautiful and stately,
and Minuets of long ago
in praise of many a noble lady.

She is the voice of funeral organs
boasting the heroic Dead
the Mourner bathed in solemn tears
through which our pain is quieted.

She is the flight of joy, the cry of tenderness,

unite the heroic burst of their chords
with the cellos’ cries.

While from a fantastic firmament
an avalanche falls—
great fragrant lilies with yellow hearts
amid soft mauve tones that move to tears
and faded lilacs.

Is this not the moment of
Immortality?
And the bitter gates
of Reality—
will they unbolt themselves
once more?

This little death—
if it only were
the great, majestic Death
so beautiful!

2 April 1890.                        <em>Picturesque rhythms</em>, 1890.","<p>Marie Krysińska is known today — though perhaps not as widely as she should be — as the first French poet to publish in free verse. However, what Krysińska meant by vers libre is not necessarily the same as what twenty-first-century Anglophone poets mean by “free verse.” (Austin Allen’s essay “Hard Line Politics” provides an excellent history of the mythical divide between free verse and form(alism); A. E. Stalling’s “Presto Manifesto!” is an elegant apologia for poetic forms of all kinds.) In the preface to her second collection, <em>Joies errantes</em> (Paris: Alphonse Lemerre, 1894), Krysińska wrote, “The sacrifice of rhyme and the symmetric cutting of the verse is only an apparent sacrifice, for eyes accustomed to regular prosodies” — thus implying that free verse, too, has prosodies, albeit irregular ones. Many of Krysińska's poems engage in rhymes that, for readers accustomed to traditional French prosody, sound decidedly slanted. Nonetheless, rhyme is there, and so is meter.</p>
<p>In translating Krysińska, I have aimed at an irregular prosody in English, a hybrid between today’s form(alism) and free verse, which I have taken to calling “free form.” This kind of prosody consists of rhythm rather than “perfect” meter; provided the line “works” as a musical phrase, it is nearly always possible to slip in an extra syllable or two. When rhyme is present, it tends to be assonant. The rhyme schemes are frequently asymmetrical. This is at least partly due to my own feeling that sound, in poetry, is just as important as meaning. But Krysińska herself was a singer-songwriter with a taste for music — and a talent for exploiting its near-endless possibilities.</p>","<p>Marie Krysińska (1857/1864 –1908) emigrated from her native city of Warsaw as a teenager to study music at the Conservatoire Nationale in Paris but chose instead to join the Hydropathes, a club of young artists performing at the cabaret Le Chat Noir. With the appearance of “The Owl” (""Le Hibou"") in the literary journal <em>Vie Moderne</em> in 1882, she became the first poet to publish free verse in the French language. By 1885 — the year of her marriage to painter Georges Bellenger — she had been exiled from the Symbolist movement by Gustave Kahn, who, attempting to claim the title “father of free verse” for himself, accused her of plagiarizing one of his unpublished drafts.</p>","<p>Samantha Pious’s translations from the poetry of Renée Vivien are available as <em>A Crown of Violets</em> (Headmistress Press, 2017); her translations of Christine de Pizan’s <em>One Hundred Ballades of a Lover</em> and his <em>Lady and Lady’s Lay</em> are on their way. She holds a Ph.D. in comparative literature from the University of Pennsylvania.</p>",French,fr,/assets/images/images_23/music.jpg,none,,,"<div>

ancient-i-am-dazed-by-the-voice,"Antico, sono ubriacato dalla voce","Ancient, I am dazed by the voice",Eugenio Montale,Carla Rossi,"Antico, sono ubriacato dalla voce
ch’esce dalle tue bocche quando si schiudono come verdi campane e si ributtano 
indietro e si disciolgono.
La casa delle mie estati lontane,
t’era accanto, lo sai,
là nel paese dove il sole cuoce
e annuvolano l’aria le zanzare.
Come allora oggi la tua presenza impietro, mare, ma non più degno
mi credo del solenne ammonimento
del tuo respiro. Tu m’hai detto primo che il piccino fermento
del mio cuore non era che un momento del tuo; che mi era in fondo
la tua legge rischiosa: esser vasto e diverso e insieme fisso:
e svuotarsi così d’ogni lordura
come tu fai che sbatti sulle sponde
tra sugheri alghe asterie
le inutili macerie del tuo abisso. ","Ancient, I am dazed by the voice
coming out of your mouths when they open up like green bells and throw themselves back
again, and melt.
The home of my remote summers
was by your side, you know that,
where the sun is scorching
and mosquitoes swarm in the air.
Now, like then, I am stunned by your presence, sea, but I don’t believe that I’m worthy anymore 
of the solemn rebuke
of your breath. You told me first
that the tiny turmoil
of my heart was nothing but a moment of yours; that after all, to me,
your law was risky — being vast and diverse and still at the same time:
and unburdening of any filth
as you do when you slam on the shores among cork seaweed starfish
the useless debris of your abyss. ","<p>“Ancient, I am dazed by the voice” is the second of nine short poems making up the poem “Mediterraneo.” In these verses Montale describes his relationship with the sea, which is representative of his existential condition. He is almost hypnotized by the sound of the waves, which he compares to bells by virtue of their rhythm. The Italian word Montale uses in the first line, <em>ubriacato</em>, would literally translate to “drunk.” I chose to render it with “dazed.” Sometimes it is inevitable for some semantic nuances to get lost in translation; a translator, however, should keep in mind that their purpose is to convey to their readers the same feelings they get in the original. For this reason, I believe “dazed” clearly sums this up.</p>
<p>Despite being an adult when he wrote “Mediterraneo,” Montale could still experience his childhood feelings when admiring the sea. When addressing the Mediterranean Sea, he says “Come allora oggi la tua presenza impietro,” and I reckon this was one of the toughest lines to translate. <em>Impietro</em> is not a word I would normally use in Italian; when hearing it I envision a stone, but it is definitely obsolete. Although in English the word “petrified” does exist, it gives off fear vibes. I chose “stunned,” because I feel the writer refers to the concept of awe.</p>
<p>My favorite passage, so interesting yet so challenging to render in English, is the line where Montale explains “the law of the sea”: “esser vasto e diverso / e insieme fisso.” It is vast and diverse, and even though it modifies its shape, it stays unchanged. I decided to go for the word “still,” because not only does it evoke the idea of the physical movement of the waves, but it also sticks to the idea presented by the author. Being still and yet washing away useless debris is what the sea does — erasing everything to start over again.</p>","<p>Born in Genoa, in North Western Italy, Eugenio Montale (1896 –1981) is considered one of the greatest Italian poets of the 20th century.</p>

<p>He was called to arms during World War I, after which he devoted his entire life to literature. With the subsequent rise of fascism, he was among the signatories of the “Manifest of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals.” He kept his literary career alive regardless of the newly established regime; some of his poems were published in Switzerland to avoid censorship. He was a journalist as well as a poet, and in 1975 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for “his distinctive poetry which, with great artistic sensitivity, has interpreted human values under the sign of an outlook on life with no illusions.</p>
<p>Montale is widely associated with what he calls <em>male di vivere</em>, which could translate to “the ill of living” or “the burden of living.” It refers to the sense of disorientation spreading in Europe between the two World Wars, which led to shared feelings of uncertainty and isolation. This theme is well represented in his most renowned collection of poems, <em>Ossi di Seppia</em> (<em>Cuttlefish Bones</em>), in which “Antico, sono ubriacato dalla voce” was published.</p>","<p>Carla Rossi graduated with a degree in conference interpreting (English and Spanish) from the University of Bologna in 2017, after spending a semester at University of Pennsylvania as an exchange student. She is not new to <em>DoubleSpeak</em>, having already published translations of Italian poems by Ungaretti and Merini. Among her tasks as interpreter, she has also translated for Indian activist Vandana Shiva. She earned her CELTA in 2019, and has been teaching English as a foreign language ever since, in both private and public schools. She also worked as a university Spanish interpreting lecturer and as a teacher for students in special education. It is no wonder, then, that she has always loved foreign languages.</p>",Italian,it,/assets/images/images_23/ancient-i-am-dazed-by-the-voice.jpeg,none,,,"<div>

all-that-glitters,淡泊,All That Glitters,Liu Guo-Fang (刘国芳),Chardonnay Needler,"根仔从小就没有志向， 秋生总问他大了做什么， 根仔说砍柴。 秋生说就砍柴吗。 根仔说还娶老婆。 秋生问娶了老婆呢， 做什么。 根仔说生儿子呀。 秋生就笑根仔， 说他没出息， 秋生总跟根仔说：“我大了一定要出去，去外面干一番事业。”

秋生大了， 真出去了。 走时， 秋生喊根仔一起去。 他们从小一起长大， 天天在一起， 秋生很希望根仔出去， 仍然天天在一起。 但根仔不出去， 根仔说: “你去吧， 我不想走。”

秋生只好一个人出去。

几年后， 秋生回来了， 秋生西装毕挺皮鞋锃亮。 一村的人都来看秋生， 说秋生有出息。 根仔便相形见绌了。 于是有人说：“根仔你也出去吧， 以后也穿西装， 穿皮鞋 。” 秋生和根仔好，  也劝他，  说; “城里怎么也比这山里好混， 你还是出去吧。”

根仔说他不出去。

又几年， 秋生带着老婆回来了， 女人长得如花似玉。 在乡下人眼里， 简直仙女一样。 村里人一脸羡墓。 这时有人见了根仔， 便说:“叫你也出去， 你不出去， 出去了也娶仙女一样的老婆， 根仔你还是出去吧 。” 秋生也劝根仔， 秋生说：“你应该开窍了， 在这山沟里要浪费你一辈子。”

根仔仍说他不出去。

再几年， 秋生担任领导了， 先是科长， 后是局长， 再是部长。 这期间秋生一年回几次家， 先是骑摩托， 后是坐吉普， 再是坐轿车。 村里人都以秋生为荣， 说到什么， 总把话往秋生身上引， 说我们村有个秋生当了部长。 秋生回来， 一村的人都意笑颜开， 这时没人再劝根仔了， 只说：“你看人家秋生， 多有出息。”

根仔也说 :  “是有出息。” 

秋生记着根仔， 回来一定要看望根仔 。

一次根仔在山上砍柴， 秋生也去了山上， 但秋生发福了， 大腹人便便， 等爬了上山去， 秋生气都喘不过来。 秋生喘着粗气跟根仔说：“你怎么就是想不开呀， 以我的地位， 你为啥要在这里砍柴?  跟我走吧， 就是看机关大门也比这里砍柴强。”

根仔还是不出去。

秋生四十岁的时候， 因喝多了酒， 得了肝硬化， 不出一月，死了。 根仔听说， 去一趟城里， 参加秋生的追悼会。 根仔和秋生一起长大， 秋生走了， 他十分难过， 见人就说: “他怎么喝那么多酒呢， 他怎么不注意身体呀， 早知道这样， 还不如跟我在山里砍柴哩 。”

根仔说得泪眼巴巴。

开完追悼会， 根仔又回到了山里。

又过了一些年 。 起先， 还有人说到秋生， 说他曾经是部长 。 很多年很多年后， 有人提到秋生了， 偶尔有人提起， 也只说他们村里曾经有人当过部长。 又很多很多年后， 村里没人再提他了， 和秋生彻底被遗忘了。

很多年很多年过去， 根仔还活着 。

根仔一百岁时， 还活着， 这时的根仔银发皓齿， 一派仙风道骨。 村里人都以根仔为荣， 说他们村有一个根仔， 一百岁， 还耳聪目明， 行走自如。 很多人都知道百岁根仔， 有人坐了小车鱼贯而来， 问根仔长寿秘诀。 根仔读过好几年书， 说得出淡泊这个词， 他说淡泊就可以长寿。 问的人也懂得淡泊这个词， 但还问怎样才算淡泊。 根仔说不想发财不想当官， 不争名逐利， 过平平淡淡的日子， 无忧无虑， 你们做得到， 就可以长寿。 听的人不问了， 把小车鱼贯开出。

这时候根仔的曾孙也上学了， 秋生的曾孙也上学了。 两个孩子就一个班 。 一天根仔的曾孙带秋生的曾孙到村里玩， 见了根仔， 曾孙喊道: “太公， 我回来了。”

秋生的曾孙就说: “你怎么有太公呀。”

根仔的曾孙说: “你没有太公吗? ”

回答 :  “我没有太公。”","From his earliest days, Genzai never had any ambition. Qiusheng would always ask him what he wanted to do when he grew up, and Genzai would always say he wanted to be a woodcutter. Qiusheng would say, “So you’d just cut wood then, huh?” to which Genzai would add, “And marry a wife, of course.” Qiusheng would ask, “And after you get hitched, what’d you do then?” Genzai would say, “Have kids, ya know.” Then, Qiusheng would laugh at Genzai, saying he’d have zero prospects, and he’d tell Genzai, “When I grow up, I’m going to get out of here, travel overseas for a bit, do real business.”

When Qiusheng grew up, he actually left. When he was going, he called out to Genzai to join him. They’d grown up together, spent every day together, so Qiusheng really hoped that Genzai would go with him, so they’d continue to spend every day together. But Genzai didn’t want to leave and said, “You go. I don’t want to leave.” 

So Qiusheng had no choice but to go by himself. 

A few years later, Qiusheng came back — decked out in a spiffy suit and dazzling leather shoes, sharply polished. The entire village came out to see him, saying he has so much potential. Genzai looked pathetic in comparison. So people started saying, “Genzai, you’ve gotta get out there. Then you can wear fancy suits and leather shoes.” Qiusheng was close with Genzai, and he encouraged him to go out, saying, “Oh, the city is crazier than the countryside. You’ve gotta get out there!”

Genzai said he didn’t want to leave. 

A few more years later, Qiusheng brought his wife back home. She was as beautiful as springtime blossoms and jade. In the eyes of the villagers, she was simply like the immortals from Daoist mythology. The whole village was envious. Now, though, people saw Genzai and said, “He’s calling to you to go too, but you’re not going. Leave and marry a woman of equal beauty and elegance. Genzai, you’ve gotta get out too.” Qiusheng kept trying to persuade Genzai, saying, “You should broaden your horizons. You can’t waste your life away in this valley.”

Genzai still said he wouldn’t go. 

Some more years after, Qiusheng took up the office of a local leader: first a section chief, then the director-general, and later a government minister. During this time period, he’d return home a couple times per year, first on motorbike, then a Jeep, and later a limousine. All the townspeople took incredible pride in him. Whatever was discussed, people always found a way to quote Qiusheng, since it was Qiusheng of their village who was appointed as a minister. When Qiusheng returned, the face of every person in the entire village lit up, beaming ear-to-ear. This time, no one encouraged Genzai to leave as well, they’d only say, “Look at our Qiusheng, what a success.”

Genzai would also say, “Yes, what a great success.” 

Qiusheng remembered Genzai, and when he came back he had to pay his old friend a visit.

One time while Genzai was chopping wood up in the mountains, Qiusheng came up to the summit as well, but he’d put on weight and now had a potbelly. Once he’d gotten to the top, he was out of breath. Qiusheng said to Genzai in staggered breaths, “How have you not thought about leaving? From my position, I don’t see…Why the hell do you want to stay here chopping wood? Leave with me, please, and then you can see that the opportunities ahead are greater than cutting wood.”

Genzai still wouldn’t go. 

When Qiusheng was forty years old, due to years of overdrinking, he got cirrhosis of the liver. Within one month, he died. Genzai heard the news and went to the city to attend Qiusheng’s memorial service. Genzai and Qiusheng had grown up together, and Qiusheng’s passing rocked him with grief. Upon seeing him he said, “How did he end up drinking that much alcohol? Why on earth did he not care for his body and health? Had I known this sooner, he might still be chopping wood with me on that mountain.”

As he said this, tears welled up in his eyes. 

After the funeral was over, Genzai returned to the mountains. 

A few years passed. At first, people still would talk about Qiusheng and how he once was a minister. Several years later, people would bring him up on occasion just to talk about how this village once had one of its people appointed as a minister. And many years after, no one brought him up again. Qiusheng had been completely forgotten. 

Yet, a good few years later, Genzai was still alive. 

Genzai was one hundred years old, still alive, except by now he had silver hair and white teeth, the spitting image of the immortal and the Daoist. All the townspeople took incredible pride in him. They’d say, “Our town has Genzai, one hundred years old, and still with sharp sight and hearing; he comes and goes with incredible ease.” So many people knew about this one-hundred-year-old Genzai, and people would drive up in lines to come see him and ask him the secret to his longevity. Genzai had read volumes of books, and still he’d come to this phrase: “eliminating covetousness.” He said that ceasing the chase for wealth can lead to longevity. Some people understood this concept, but then would still ask, “Well, how do you actually stop striving after fame and fortune?” He’d say, “Don’t think about earning money or becoming a government official, don’t pursue titles and tokens. Just plainly live out your days, worriless, without anxieties. If you can do that, then you will be able to live a long and healthy life.” Those who heard would ask no further questions, just leave in the same line they came. 

This same time, Genzai’s great-grandson and Qiusheng’s great-grandson both were in school. The kids were even in the same class. One day, Genzai’s great-grandson brought Qiusheng’s great-grandson into the village for a playdate. Upon seeing Genzai, Genzai’s great-grandson cried out, “Great-granddad, I’m back!”

Qiusheng’s great-grandson said, “How do you have a great-grandpa?”

Genzai’s great-grandson said, “You don’t have a great-granddad? Huh?”

The response: “I don’t have a great-grandpa.”","<p>I translate somewhat loosely. Tone is more important than exact meaning for me, and when translating much of the dialogue, I ad-libbed quite a bit to make the conversation sound more natural. Some terms were simplified or formalized depending on flow.</p>

<p>Other terms were also liberally translated to try to contextualize post-revolutionary China with a modern audience. For instance, Jeeps were a cultural symbol of the time period, with much propaganda featuring Mao and other government officials popularizing the invention nation-wide. It is difficult to relate the novelty of items like tailored suit ensembles, Jeeps, and personal vehicles to modern-day status symbols, so instead of using the actual translation of <span lang=""zh"">轿车</span> (“car”), I decided to choose a different word that would get the concept of opulence and societal importance to readers in a modern context: a limo.</p>

<p>What's beautiful about this piece is that it is so simple but pulls on centuries of philosophy that permeate even the title. There were many references to Buddhist and Daoist thought throughout that helped cement the greater meaning of simplistic purpose against extravagant meaninglessness, but some of these may seem obscure to the average reader. The immortal in Daoist thought has many connotations, few of which sync up one-to-one with Greek and Judeo-Christian philosophy. “Immortal” (<span lang=""zh"">仙</span>), seen in reference to the wife being “the same as the immortals from Daoist mythology” and Genzai becoming “the spitting image of the immortal and the Daoist” doesn't and shouldn't mean one who will never die, but rather one who has attained a heightened place of spiritual and philosophical transcendence and therefore has attained a higher status even in this life.</p>

<p>Buddhist and Daoist permeates the simple piece. The very title —“<span lang=""zh"">淡泊</span>”— is a reference to the phrases <span lang=""zh"">淡泊名利</span> and <span lang=""zh"">淡泊明志, 宁静致远</span>. Both of these phrases have been used since the Three Kingdoms era to refer to a cessation of personal want — through either “name” (<span lang=""zh"">名</span>), “money” (<span lang=""zh"">利</span>), or even notoriety — for the tradeoff of peace and ultimate success.</p>
","<p>Liu Guo-Fang (b.1957), like Genzai, isn’t a man who chases after fortune. That being said, he is sometimes called “The Father of Chinese Short Stories.” A decorated and respected short story author and novelist, he was born in Jiangxi province’s Linchuan district. A recipient of the 2003 Golden Sparrow Award, Liu’s pieces frequently juxtapose ambition and anxiety, modernity and missteps.</p>

<p>Having gotten his start publishing for publications such as China Writer and People’s Daily, Liu has since published over four million words (or well over hundred stories) in print. His pieces, including “All That Glitters,” pose a frightening question to cosmopolitan readers: Is the grass really greener on the other side?</p>

Ya no es mágico el mundo. Te han dejado. 
Ya no compartirás la clara luna
Ni los lentos jardines. Ya no hay una
Luna que no sea espejo del pasado, 
Cristal de soledad, sol de agonías. 
Adiós las mutuas manos y las sienes 
Que acercaba el amor. Hoy sólo tienes 
La fiel memoria y los desiertos días. 
Nadie pierde (repites vanamente)
Sino lo que no tiene y no ha tenido 
Nunca, pero no basta ser valiente
Para aprender el arte del olvido.
Un símbolo, una rosa, te desgarra
Y te puede matar una guitarra.

Ya no seré feliz. Tal vez no importa. 
Hay tantas otras cosas en el mundo; 
Un instante cualquiera es más profundo 
Y diverso que el mar. La vida es corta 
Y aunque las horas son tan largas, una 
Oscura maravilla nos acecha,
La muerte, ese otro mar, esa otra flecha 
Que nos libra del sol y de la luna
Y del amor. La dicha que me diste
Y me quitaste debe ser borrada;
Lo que era todo tiene que ser nada.
Sólo que me queda el goce de estar triste, 
Esa vana costumbre que me inclina
Al Sur, a cierta puerta, a cierta esquina.","I 

The world’s no longer magic. They have left you. 
You will no longer share the clear bright moon 
Nor the slow gardens. Now there is no longer 
A moon that’s not a mirror of the past, 
Crystal of solitude, sun of agonies.
Goodbye to mutual hands and to our temples
That love brought near. Today you only have
The loyal memory and the deserted days. 
One only loses (you repeat in vain)
What one does not have and has never had 
But being brave is not enough to learn
The art of forgetting: oblivion.
A symbol or a rose tears up your heart 
What’s more, you can be killed by a guitar.

I won’t be happy now. Perhaps it doesn’t matter. 
So many other things are in the world;
A random instant is far more profound
And varied than the sea. Yes, life is short 
And though the hours are so long, a dark 
Wonder lies in ambush, stalking us,
Death, that other sea, that other arrow
That frees us from the sun and from the moon
And love as well. The happiness you gave me
And took away from me must be erased.
What once was everything now must be nothing.
Only that I still enjoy being sad, 
That vain habit that makes me inclined to 
The South, a certain door, a certain corner.","<p>I translated Jorge Luis Borges’ double sonnet into blank verse to preserve the poem’s original rhythm and to avoid distorting its syntax or meaning to fit the confines of sonnets’ strict rhyme schemes. I translated lines literally wherever possible and usually chose words whose pattern of stressed syllables and number of total syllables best fit iambic pentameter. I also used rhythm to create emphasis, especially when I added “yes” before “life is short” (la vida es corta) to keep the meter.</p>
<p>I used some secondary meanings to keep the rhythm, such as when I translated <em>diverso</em> as “varied” rather than “diverse.” I sometimes included both meanings of a word to fit the meter and to enrich the images. <em>Clara</em> means “clear; bright,” so I rendered ""clara luna"" as “clear bright moon.” <em>Acechar means</em> “to lie in ambush; to stalk,” so I translated ""nos acecha"" as “lies in ambush, stalking us” to vividly depict how death seems distant yet inexorably sneaks up on people.</p>
<p>I translated other phrases more freely, such as ""un instante cualquiera,"" where I used its implied meaning of “a random instant” instead of the literal “any instant.” While “y te puede matar una guitarra” means “and a guitar can kill you,” I rendered it as “what’s more, you can be killed by a guitar” to add the number of syllables required for iambic pentameter. Ending the line with “guitar” also creates a slant rhyme with “heart” at the end of the previous line. As in the original, the first sonnet now concludes with an emphasis on its subject, the reminiscing lover’s pained susceptibility to beauty, instead of “oblivion,” the subject of the second sonnet.</p>
<p>""No basta ser valiente / Para aprender el arte del olvido"" means “But being brave is not enough / To learn the art of forgetting.” I changed the enjambment and idiomatically translated ""el arte del olvido"" (“the art of forgetting”), then added <em>olvido</em>’s literal meaning (“oblivion”). Instead of having two too-short lines, I created one in perfect iambic pentameter followed by one with near-perfect meter. However, I translated the poem’s penultimate line literally, sacrificing rhythm for meaning to avoid making the syntax awkward.</p>","<p>Jorge Luis Borges (1899 – 1986) was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he grew up bilingual in English and Spanish and read widely in European literature. As an adolescent, he spent seven years with his family in Europe, where he learned French, German, and Latin. When they returned to Buenos Aires in 1921, he began his literary career as a poet and translator of poetry. For most of his life, he was known mainly in Latin America for his poetry. He developed an international reputation as a fiction writ- er after receiving the Prix Formentor International Publishers Prize in 1961, which spurred the translation of his best-known short story and essay collections, <em>Ficciones</em> (<em>Fictions</em>, 1944) and <em>Labyrinths</em> (1962), into English and other languages. His blend of genres and use of metafiction in his fantastical postmodern stories about the nature of time and reality strongly influenced the development of magic realism. His writings and sudden fame also helped catalyze the Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s, in which the books of young experimental and political novelists such as Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes, and Mario Vargas Llosa began to reach a global audience.

to-read-in-case-of-snow,Te Lezen bij Sneeuw,To Read in Case of Snow,"Esther Jansma",C.H. Henry,"Een paar hoeken om en je staat in de stilte
op een bodem, tussen oude muren, lagen metselwerkin
zomaar een winter. Uit de tijd gestapt.

Het vriest. Kinderen — theemutsjes op lompe beentjes — 
rapen takken en sneeuw van de grond net zoals
zij eeuwen geleden deden tussen de stenen

het gemetselde lapwerk in het zwijgen van het hof 
waar als je goed luistert ijle stemmen misschien
de flarden van iets mateloos naar het heden zingen.

Dat is nu, vandaag. Het schemert al. De kinderen 
spelen zoals ze spelen, omringd door tijd
waar jij niet bent. Jij kijkt naar hun herinneringen.","Turn a couple corners and you stand in the silence 
on the ground, between old walls, layers of masonry 
in just any winter. You stepped out of time. 

It is freezing. Children — tea cozies on clumsy legs — 
pick up branches and snow from the ground just
like they did ages ago between the stones 

the masonry patchwork in the hush of the court
where if you listen carefully, airy voices perhaps
sing the fragments of something measureless to the present. 

That is now, today. It is already growing dark. The children 
play as they play, surrounded by time
where you are not. You look at their memories. ","<p>Most of my translation experience up to the present has been limited to workbook exercises and Dutch books. As a class, we have spent a considerable amount of time on significant pieces of Dutch literature like Anne Frank’s Diary. More recently, we have begun looking into songs and poetry — as a guitarist and singer, I have enjoyed our examination of music outside the U.S. I found Esther Jansma’s “Te lezen bij sneeuw” (<em>To read in case of snow</em>) after scouring the internet for a new name and title; I wanted to translate material that neither I nor my professor had read. After settling on this particular poem, translating it was not particularly difficult, save a few words I had never come across. The unusual speech structure of some lines caught me off guard. For instance, “Uit de tijd gestapt” is an unusual sentence that directly translates to “You stepped out of time.” The second person speech and simplicity of the messaging is strange for any translator aiming for complete accuracy. I enjoyed yet was momentarily confused by Jansma’s use of the word <em>mateloos</em> which I chose to interpret as measureless. Describing a song as measureless is not something I have heard of, but I found it to be an interesting choice executed by the poet. Lastly, the phrase “omringd door tijd waar jij niet bent” had me confronting my professor for guidance because the ordering confused me. I eventually settled on “surrounded by time where you are not.” The use of where seems strange until you consider that the poem is about existing within a memory. Overall, I am satisfied with the English version of the poem, and by translating it, I feel more connected with its nostalgic nature.</p>","<p>Esther Jansma (b. 1958) is from Amsterdam. She studied Archaeology and Philosophy at Amsterdam University. She now teaches geoscience at the University of Utrecht, but it is her work outside of the lecture halls that speaks to mass audiences in the Netherlands. Since 1988’s <em>Voice
Under My Bed</em>, she has been writing and publishing poetry, and her talents in prose have not gone unnoticed — she has won the Dutch-language VSB Poetry Prize among other accolades for her various publications. In Jansma’s own words, a poet is “the rag-and-bone man, collector of remnants, moments, cracks in things.” Much like her day-to-day work of dating artifacts and estimating the age of trees, poetry is Jansma’s opportunity to stitch together stories from the remains of previous poets. Her interests may seem fragmented at first glance, but upon deeper inspection, her writing is only bolstered by her life experience as a mother, archaeologist, and Dutch academic in a world which frequently ignores the past.</p>","<p>C.H. Henry is a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania currently studying communications and diplomatic history with a minor in theater arts. For the past two years, he has been learning to speak, read, and write Dutch, and along the way, he has had the opportunity to learn about the history and actively engage in the culture via the Netherlands — America Association of the Delaware Valley. His relatives and family in Nashville, Tennessee, are not directly Dutch, but he has enjoyed learning a language he previously had little to no knowledge of until reaching Penn. He hopes more students will pursue the same remote interests.</p>",Dutch,nl,/assets/images/images_23/to-read-in-case-of-snow.jpg,none,,,,,2023,submission,
dont-bother-the-earth-spirit,Don't Bother the Earth Spirit,Don't Bother the Earth Spirit,Joy Harjo,<em>DoubleSpeak</em> Staff,"Don’t bother the earth spirit who lives here. She is working on a story. It is the oldest story in the world and it is delicate, changing. If she sees you watching she will invite you in for coffee, give you warm bread, and you will be obligated to stay and listen. But this is no ordinary story. You will have to endure earthquakes, lightning, the deaths of all those you love, the most blinding beauty. It’s a story so compelling you may never want to leave; this is how she traps you. See that stone finger over there? That is the only one who ever escaped.

<h1>No molestes a l’esperit de la terra<h1>
<h2>translated into Catalan by Lucía Vázquez<h2>

No molestes a l'esperit de la terra que viu aquí. Està treballant en una història. És la història més antiga del món, i és delicada, canviant. Si veu que l'observes, et convidarà a prendre un cafè, et donarà pa calent, i et veuràs estaràs obligat a quedar-te i escoltar. Però aquesta no és una història ordinària. Hauràs de sobreviure terratrèmols, llamps, les morts d'aquells als quals amaga, la bellesa més cegadora. És una història tan irresistible que pot que mai vulguis marxar; així és com ella t'atrapa. Veus aquí aquest dit de pedra? Aquest és l'únic que mai ha escapat.

<h2>translated into Galician by Lucía Vázquez<h2>

Non molestes ao espírito da terra que vive aquí. Está a traballar nunha historia. É a historia máis antiga do mundo, e é delicada, cambiante. Se ve que a observas, convidarache a tomar un café, darache pan quente, e verasche estarás obrigado a quedarche e escoitar. Pero esta non é unha historia ordinaria. Terás que sobrevivir terremotos, lóstregos, as mortes daqueles aos que amas, a beleza máis cegadora. É unha historia tan irresistible que poida que nunca queiras marcharche; así é como ela che atrapa. Ves aí ese dedo de pedra? Ese é o único que xamais escapou.

<h1>地の霊を煩わさないように<h1>
<h2>translated into Japanese by Stacy Shimanuki, Tsubasa Somasundaram Inada, and Chardonnay Needler<h2>

ここに住む地の霊を煩わさないように。 物語を作っているから。 世界で最も古い話で、繊細で、いつも変わっている。 彼女と目が会ったら、家の中に誘われて、コーヒーと温かいパンを出してもらって、そこで彼女の話を聞かないといけなくなる。 でも、普通の話じゃない。 地震や雷、愛するすべての人が死ぬという、目をくらますような美しさに耐えなければならない。 話に魅了されて、一生帰りたくなくなるかも、彼女はそうやって罠をかける。 あそこの石になった指が見える？ここを抜け出せたのは、あいつだけなんだよ。

<h1>不要打扰那位自然神灵<h1>
<h2>translated into Simplified Chinese by Chardonnay Needler, Zijie “Harry” Zhu, Hannah Zhao, and Katherine Rozsypalek<h2>

不要打扰住在这里的那位自然神灵。她在写故事。这是世界上最古老的故事，而它也很优雅，在改变。如果她看着你看着她，她会请你进入喝咖啡，给你吃温热面包，然后你有义务留下来倾听。但是这并不是平凡的故事。你需要忍地震，闪电，亲人的死亡，最刺眼的壮丽。这故事如此引人，甚至你可能永远离不开；这就是她困住你的方法。你看见那边那支石头的手指了吗？这是唯逃脱过的人。

Si ve que la observas, te invitará a tomar un café, te dará pan caliente, y te verás obligado a quedarte y escuchar. Pero esta no es una historia ordinaria. Tendrás que sobrevivir terremotos, relámpagos, las muertes de aquellos a los que amas, la belleza más cegadora.

Nun fastidies al espíritu de la tierra que vive equí. Ta trabayando n’una hestoria. Hestoria más antigua del mundu, y ye delicada, cambiante. Si ve que la repares, te va convidar a tomar un café, te va dar pan caliente, y te vas ver obligáu a quedate y escuchar. Pero esta nun ye una hestoria ordinaria.

<h1>Neruš zemní duše</h1>
<h2>translated into Czech by Katherine Rozsypalek, Leo Wagner, and Ryan Hardy</h2>

Neruš zemní duše, které zde bydlí. Ona pracuje na příběhu. Je to nejstarší příběh na světě a je to choulostivé, měnící se. Jestli tě ona uvidí že se na ni díváš, ona tě pozve dovnitř na kávu, dá ti teplý chléb, a budeš povinen zůstat a poslouchat. Ale toto není obyčejný příběh. Budeš muset vydržet zemětřesení, blesky, smrti všech, které miluješ, nejvíc oslepující krásu. Je to příběh tak přesvědčivý, že je možné že nebudeš nikdy chtít odejít; takhle tě ona zlape. Vidíš támhle ten kamenný prst? To je jediný, kdo kdy vyvázl. 

<h1>Ärger die Erdgeistin nicht</h1>
<h2>translated into German by Benjamin McAvoy-Bickford and Ryan Hardy</h2>

Ärger die Erdgeistin nicht, die hier wohnt. Sie arbeitet an einer Geschichte. Dass ist die älteste Geschichte der Welt und sie ist empfindlich, wechselnd. Wenn du guchts und sie dich sieht, wird sie dich für Kaffee einladen, dir warmes Brot geben, und dann musst du bleiben und anhören. Aber sie ist keine gewöhnliche Geschichte. Du wirst Erdbeben, Blitzschlagen, und die Todesfälle von aller die du liebst, die blendendste Schönheit, ertragen müssen. Es ist eine so unwiderstehliche Geschichte, dass du vielleicht nie gehen willst; es ist als ob sie dich einfängt. Siehst du dort den steinen Finger? Er ist der einzige, der jemals entfliehen ist.

<h1>Noli turbare deam terrestrem<h1>
<h2>translated into Latin by Benjamin McAvoy-Bickford</h2>

Noli turbare deam terrestrem qui hic habitat. Narrationem operatur. Est narratio antiquissima orbem terrarum et commutans tenerque. Si te observantem videt te hospitaliter invitabit tibi panem caldum dabit tibique manendum et audiendum erit. Sed narratio haec non vulgata est. Tibi terraemotus fulgura mortes amatissimorum pulchritudinemque splendidissimam perpeti necesse erit. Narratio cogens est, ut numquam abire velis; te hac irretit. Digitumne illum lapidis vides? Unicus fugitus est.

<h1>Не беспокойте Духа Земли<h1>
<h2>translated into Russian by Ryan Hardy and Leo Wagner<h2>

Не беспокойте Духа Земли, которая здесь живёт. Она работает над рассказом. Рассказ самый старый в мире и хрупкий, меняющийся. Если она тебя видит, смотря на ней, она приглашает тебя у себя за кофе, даёт тебя тёплый хлеб и будешь обязан остаться её послушать. А рассказ не такой необычный. Тебя нужно будет терпеть землетрясения, молния, смерти всех твоих любимых, самую ослепительную красоту. Это рассказ такой неотразимый, что возможно ты никогда не захочешь уходить. И так она тебя поймёт. Видишь вон тот каменный палец? Он единственный, который сбежал.
