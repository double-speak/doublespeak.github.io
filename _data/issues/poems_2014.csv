Besides studying poetry with Hajin, Buson also studied calligraphy, Chinese-style poetry (kanshi), and Noh chanting (yokyoku).

Occupent nos esprits et travaillent nos corps,
Et nous alimentons nois aimables remords,
Comme les mendiants nourissent leur vermine,

Nos péchés sont têtus, nos repentirs sont låches;
Nous nous faison payer grassement nos aveux,
Et nous rentrons gaiement dans le chemin bourbeux,
Croyant par de vils pleurs laver toutes nos taches.

Sur l'oreiller du mal c'est Satan Trismégiste
Qui berce longuement notre esprit enchanté,
Et le riche métal de notre volonté
Est tout vaporisé par ce savant chimiste.

C'est le Diable qui tient les fils qui nous remuent!
Aux objets répugnants nous trouvons des appas;
Chaque jour vers l'Enfer nous descendons d'un pas,
Sans horreur, à travers des ténèbres qui puent.

Ainsi qu'um débauché pauvre qui baise et mange
Le sein martyrisé d'une antique catin,
Nous volons au passage un plaisir clandestin
Que nous pressons bien fort comme un veille orange.

Serré, fourmillant, comme un million d'helminthes,
Dans nos cervaux ribote un peuple de Démons,
Et, quand nous respirons, la Mort dans nos poumons 
Descend, fleuve invisible, avec sourdes plaintes.

Si le viol, le poison, le poignard, l'incendie, 
N'ont pas encor brodé de leurs plaisants dessins
Le canevas banal de nos piteux destins,
C'est que notre âme, hélas! n'est pas assez hardie.
Mais parmi les chacals, les panthères, les lices,

Dans la ménagerie infâme de nos vices,

Il en est un plus laid, plus méchant, plus immonde!
Quoiqu'il ne pousse ni grands gestes ni grands cris,
Il ferait volontiers de la terre un débris
Et dans un bâillement avalerait le monde;

C'est l'Ennui! L'oeil chargé d'un pleure involontaire,
Il rêve d'échaufauds en fumant son houka.
Tu le connais, lecteur, ce monstre délicat,
— Hypocrite lecteur, — mon semblable, — mon frère!","Complacency, corruption, sin, greed,
Infiltrate our spirits and work our corpse,
And we nourish our genial remorse,
Like mice flocking to beggars to feed,

Our sins are stubborn, our repentance lax;
We pay a hefty sum for our confessions,
Then happily rejoin the path of transgression,
Thinking that vile tears will erase our tracks.

On the cushion of evil, it's Satan Trismegist;
Our charmed spirits he cradles in submission,
And the rich metal of all our volition,
Is vaporized by this cunning alchemist.

It's the devil who holds the strings that move us!
With the repugnant objects we become entrance;
Each day one step closer to hell we advance,
Without repulsion, through the rancid darkness.

And like a wasteful pauper who kisses and eats
The martyred chest of a weathered whore,
As we pass by, we steal a secret pleasure
That we squeeze like an old orange until replete.

Tightly swarming, like a million parasites,
In our brains, Demon-people bang their drums,
And when we breathe, death fills our lungs –
An invisible river flowing with muted cries.

If rape, poison, knives or a fire blazing
Have not etched their pleasing design
On the banal canvas our destine define,
It's that our soul, alas! Is not so brazen.

But among the jackals, the panthers, the lice,
The monkeys, scorpions, vultures, snakes,
The rampant monsters' yelps and shrieks,
In the infamous, infinite menagerie of our vice,

One more ugly, crueler, and sinful lives on!
Though he makes no loud cries on grand gestures,
He would easily demolish the earth with pleasure,
And swallow the world with a simple yawn;

It's Boredom! Guilty of causing the tears of another,
He dreams of guillotines while smoking his pipe.

7/14/1993","--for Xia, going to Tibet alone

One morning,
One yawning and tired morning,
I imagined
that between you
and the high plateau,
the sky must be
unthinkably deep
and far. Lacking
wind, cloud or fog
the translucent blue
perplexes.

When you left,
I was calm.
But when I could no longer see your shadow
the longing for my beloved grew up

and another person wanders and wanders through the lines
in a very small palm of a child
meandering through my body
looking for the only word.

Words don't need wings
They wheel around
Guiding the spirit like a scent in the air
The morning rays fumble
Like the new shoes you bought
for this long-distance trip.

Fluttered open, this time
has allowed my dreams
to be pregnant but not married.
Sealed with snow,

the peaks snatch
the mist you exhale.

<h2>translated by Tim Lorndale</h2>

Over and out of the Bulgarian landscape, 
canons and their fodder thunder,
Echoing on the hillsides, the sounds ricochet and fall flat.
There are throngs of people, beasts, cars and my own thoughts.
The horse-road neighs as it rears in the distance. 
The sunset, its mane runs along the horizon.
Despite being on the move, constantly, your image is my anchor.
Shining forth from my mind's depths,
Still and silent,
You are like the angel looking on at the destruction
Or, like the bug hiding itself in my mind's hollowed oak.


<h2>translated by Eirini Lemos</h2>

From Bulgaria rumbling the brutish canon fires
strikes the crags. Hesitates. Falls.
Men and carts and thoughts and beasts pile up 
and block the neighing road rears up; 
the sky runs off its mane billowing behind it. 
In this chaos you remain with me, ignore the movement. 
This is permanent. Deep, beneath in my unconscious 
you are still bright, eternally bright
like a mute angel in awe of death's carnival
or an insect in a rotted trunk, observing its funeral.


<h2>translated by Meg Pendoley</h2>

Thick, wild cannon fire is rolling from Bulgaria.
It pulses on the mountain ridge, then hesitates and falls;
a pile-up, confusion of carts, thoughts, animals and men,
screaming, the road rears up into sky, mane running.
And you, constant in this body of chaos,
gleaming in the dark of my consciousness, forever still
and mute, like an angel of death, wondering,
or like a beetle burrowed in the rot heart of a tree.


<h2>translated by Lauren Kaufmann</h2>

The erratic heartbeat rolls like cannon fire from Bulgaria--
pounds the mountains, hesitates, then sighs to silence.
Under a flowing forelock of clouds, the neighing road spooks
at the monstrous pile of carts, animals, men, thoughts.
And amid this chaos, love, only you feel constant,
kindling my core from the darkest comer, the one I cannot reach,
and quiet, like an angel marveling at Lucifer's fall
or a caterpillar weaving a future in the heart of a rotting tree.


<h2>translated by Mirela Zaneva</h2>

From Bulgaria thick, loud cannon pounding rolls,
resounds on the mountaintop ridges, rebounds, hesitates and falls.
The sky unfurls its wild mane above, but the road below
neighs, bucks, and stops.
A tangled blockage of men, beasts, wagons, and thought.
In this chaos and turbulence, I keep you with me, permanent.
Saved deeply in my mind, you shine. Forever saved, still,
like an angel stunned to silence by death
or like a tiny beetle entombed in dying trees.


<h2>translated by Josh Bryer</h2>

The Bulgarian barrage, cannon blasts, a
heartbeat slams the mountain, first hesitating then falling
a jamming of man, animals, carts, thoughts
the whinnying road roaring runs the sky's mane
constant in the changing confusion you are in me
deep in my conscious you shine continuously drained
a mute angel wondrous, admiring its destruction
or a bug burying itself in the hole of a dead tree


<h2>translated by Emma Hirvisalo</h2>

From Bulgaria cannon fire rages and roars
To defy the mountain ridge, then to hesitate and fall.
Below concocts a jumbled jam-of thoughts, beasts, carts and men
On a road that quivers and rears, clouds gallop in the horizon.
Yet you sit so still within me amid this fluid confusion
A blooming silence in the chaos, you ocean
Like a mute angel bedazzled by death's dance,
Or a tree beetle lighting his home in the rotting plant.


<h2>translated by  Rafael Rodriguez</h2>

Out of Bulgaria, the sound of the cannons is heard;
a spectral roar that spreads through the mountains
and crashes into silence like a flashing whip.
Meanwhile down here, all hasten to the lash:
the roads reverberate with the trampling of hoofs
and the clouds disperse in fretful gallop,
as man, beast, cart and thought all collide into one.
And all the while you remain veiled in my mind
lying still and untouched; close inside, yet
far, and suspended, as a lone candle swaying to a naive breeze.
Somewhere inside me, you are preserved forever in this way,
just like a beetle hibernating in a rotting tree.

","<p>Students in a seminar at Penn on the translation of poetry were asked to translate the first of Hungarian poet Miklós Radnóti's four ""Picture Postcards"" for this issue of <em>DoubleSpeak<em/>. The students studied three published translations of the poem along with a or word-for-word translation, or literal rendering, by a native Hungarian speaker.</p>

","<p>Miklós Radnóti was one of the great Hungarian poets of the twentieth century. He lived in Budapest, where streets have been named after him; statues of Radnóti have been erected throughout the country.

The ""Postcards"" ( or ""Razglednicas,"" as Radnóti titled them, attaching a plural Hungarian ending to the Serbian word for ""postcard"") comprised Radnóti's last poem, written during a forced march at the end of World War II. This first section was written just outside the labor camp in Yugoslavia where Radnóti had been interned and from which Nazi forces chose to retreat with their prisoners rather than surrender to the approaching Russian army. When Radnóti wrote this first section of the poem in August of 1944, three thousand Jewish prisoners had just begun the march toward Germany. When he wrote the fourth and final of section of the poem in October, roughly twenty prisoners remained alive. 

Radnóti was shot and thrown into a mass grave along with the others, having prophesied his death precisely in the fourth section of the poem.

Over a year later, his widow Fanni Gyarmati insisted that his body be exhumed. This poem--perhaps addressed to her--was found in a book Radnóti had sealed in plastic and placed in his back pocket. 

Fanni Gyarmati died this year at the age of 102.</p>","<p>The translators of this poem were all students in Professor Silverman's Translation of Poetry seminar, and included native speakers of Finnish, Bulgarian, Spanish, Greek, and English, as well as scholars of Sanskrit and ancient Greek.</p>",Hungarian,hu,,,,,,,2014,,submission

con pamela, impertinentes y botón
de amapola en el oleaja de sus vuelos.
Hoy la voluble señorita es amistad,
y acaricia finalmente el corazón
con su más delgado pétalo de hielo.

Por eso hoy, 
gentilmente, te convido a pasear
por el patio, hasta el florido pabellón
de aquel árbol que plantaron los abuelos.
Hoy el ensueño es como el musgo en el brocal,
dibujando los abismos de un amor
melancólico, sutil, pálido cielo.

Viene a mí, avanza
—viene tan despacio—,
viene en un danza
leve en el espacio.
Cedo, me hago lacio
y ya vuelo, ave.
Se mece la nave 
lenta, como el tul
en la brisa suave
niña del azul.

Oh, melancolía, novia silenciosa,
íntima pareja del ayer.

siempre me arrebata tu placer.

beso que retorna como el mar.

dime quién me puede amar.","Today the lonely damsel comes to see me 
unbidden-,with pamela and lorgnette,
and poppy brooches redolent of blue silk flight.
Today this gentle touch is fickle friendship,
that finally answers the hearty caress,
with her thinnest petal flakes of ice.

And so today,
I bid you climb aloft
to the pavilion through these gray stone-steps
where April comes again for the grandfather pine.
Today the apparitions are like moss
on the curb of a well, tracing the depths
of a silhouette-subtle, melancholic, pale sky.

Slowly it comes to me,
lulled in a dance.
Rousing and hoisting,
ethereal it glides.
I yield, Icarus,
and now too, fly.
Slow sways the vessel,
slow, like the tulle
soft in the zephyr,
girl of azure ...
0, Melancolia, my come-and-go bride,
solemn shade in garbs of yesterday.
0, Melancolia, take me in the night;
drown the silence with your soft refrain.

kiss me oceanic, near and far.
0, Melancolia, flower in the breath,
tell me who can bear my heart!","<p>Perhaps useful as a backdrop for interpreting

Me semble l'égal des Dieux, car il entend
Ruisseler ton rire et rêver ton silence,

Subtile, une flamme a traversé ma chair,
Et ma sueur coule ainsi que la rosée
        Apre de la mer;

Un bourdonnement remplit de bruits d'orage
Mes oreilles, car je sombre sous l'effort,
Plus pâle que l'herbe, et je vois ton visage 
        À travers la mort.

","The lucky man whom you make mad, he seems
The equal of the Gods, in that he hears
Your laughter streaming and your silence dream,

I shudder, and I cannot speak to you:
A subtle flame has passed right through my flesh,
And my sweat flows just like the bitter dew
        Of the ocean's crest;

A roaring of the noise of storms at sea
Fills my ears, for I founder in distress,
More pale than the wild grass, and then I see

Many Latin words possess sound and letter combinations that are not frequently used in English. I solved this problem by translating many of the sounds less ""literally."" If l could not find a close English match for a Latin word that flowed in the context of the piece, I chose an English word that sounded very similar and possessed the same root sounds. In some instances, I also combined the endings of a Latin word with the beginning of the next word. When the Latin poem is read aloud by a native or fluent speaker, the words seem to blend together in this manner, and combining the ending and beginning sounds of words mimicked this affect. For example, the words ""incitare morsus,"" which sound like ""in-kit-are-ray morse us,"" became ""in guitar remorse us."" I feel that incorporating common English words like ""guitar,"" as well ""hurray"" and ""scenario"" makes the piece more relatable and enjoyable for 
the reader. In addition, juxtaposing less frequently used words like ""legume"" and ""hipsta"" with illogical sounds such as ""grr"" gives the piece a unique flair and creates an upbeat rhythm. At the same time, many erotic attributes of the original poem are naturally preserved because of the way these Latin words sound.</p>",<p>Catullus was a poet during the late Roman Republic who died around 54 B.C.</p>,"<p>Sarah is a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences, studying Economics.</p>",Latin,la,,,,,,,2014,,submission
