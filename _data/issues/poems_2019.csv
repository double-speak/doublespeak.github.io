For example, argaman is a reddish-purple dye used in biblical times. Because of its use in the temple design, it has a regal connotation that is lost in the translation (“crimson”). The fact that articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and pronouns are often attached to other words in Hebrew allows for concision that is not possible in English (where “and” and “in” are individual words). The final line (three words) of the poem literally translates to “here, I am like this” — but that felt too wordy, so I chose to maintain the simplicity of the original last line instead. Finally, the gendered nature of Hebrew words (with a few set suffixes) makes rhyming
much easier in Hebrew than English, so rhymes or slant-rhymes are mostly omitted from this translation, since I endeavored to preserve Rachel’s images above all else.</p>","<p>Rachel Bluwstein (1890–1931) — better known in Hebrew as “Rachel the Poetess” — is one of Israel’s most beloved poets.

Similarly, the man who walks too slowly
sometimes lags behind himself

becomes the junk

Sometimes he sits to the right of himself

he always sits not too far from himself

When translating this poem, I changed the part of speech of some words in the original poem. For example, in the first line, the original Chinese poem used an adjective “fast-walking” (<span lang=""zh"">走得太快的</span>) to describe “the man,” but in my translation, I changed it into a verbal phrase “walk too fast” and put it in an attributive clause to describe the fast walking action of this man. Also, the direct translations of the last two lines are “Fortunately in general / he always sits near himself.” I omitted “in general” to make the English sentence flow better, and used “not too far from” rather than “near” to indicate that moderation is crucial in <em>Zhong Yong</em> (<span lang=”zh”>中庸</span>).</p>","<p>Li Yuansheng was born in Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, where poetry is deeply rooted in the local culture and life.

to see the sun, like a phoenix, rise and take flight.
 
We haven’t slept to see, at daybreak, our poetics
come hand in hand, with love itself, to the door and strike.
 
The morning breeze takes your fragrance as travelmate,
so that he can visit the roses in the garden beaming with pride.
 
Night burned with our fever, our union like water
on the burning bodies of those set alight.
 
What am I to do all day so far from you?
What if I start thinking of our bed as it was that night?
 
When you’re next to me, it’s the height of ungratefulness
if my eyelashes come together, covering my sight.
 
Cover the window, you’re nude! and I’m afraid
that the evil eye of a star may strike you in spite.
 
I wrote ghazals about your lips ever more passionately,
so that they may kiss my lips with even more passion tonight.","<p>Whether motivated by certain scholarly sensibilities or a personal attachment to the centuries-old history of <em>ghazal</em>, I decided to leave the word untranslated. The <em>ghazal</em>, often translated as lyric poetry, is a poetic tradition that spans across languages and geographical boundaries. The Persian <em>ghazal</em> is defined by two sets of characteristics. First, the form, the “aa-ba-ca” rhyme scheme, is the most recognizable formal feature of the <em>ghazal</em>; there are also rules governing meter. Second, regarding the content, the <em>ghazal</em> tradition comes with a cluster of images, devices, and conventions. <em>Ghazals</em> do not have titles.</p>
<p>As such, the translator’s challenge is also two-fold; formal qualities of the Persian <em>ghazal</em> are impossible to fully import into English. I have attempted to approximate the sound of the <em>ghazal</em> by keeping the rhyme scheme, albeit imperfectly. The conventional images are even more difficult to “translate.” The morning breeze, the rose garden, the <em>ghazal</em> itself as it is referenced in the last line, the night of separation and the morning of union that form the conceptual universe of the poem here are all common tropes within the tradition of the <em>ghazal</em>. A translation of a <em>ghazal</em> into another language — and by extension a new poetic and cultural space — divorces these images from the rich tapestry of meaning that they are a part of and that gives each of them more significance than a poem standing by itself can carry. I chose this <em>ghazal</em> to translate in part because I thought that even after the violent severance that is inevitable in the act of translation, the images retained some of their vibrancy and vitality.</p>","<p>Hossein Monzavi (d. 2003) was an Iranian poet, essayist, and translator. Known especially for his exceptional <em>ghazals</em>, Monzavi’s poetry has been regarded as a masterful amalgamation of conventional <em>ghazal</em> imagery and poetic innovation in the style of twentieth-century Persian free verse. His verse is recognizable by its effortless flow and its spiritedness. Monzavi wrote in Azeri Turkish, in addition to Persian. The <em>ghazal</em> here was selected from a collection of his poems titled <em>But You Human-in-Love, No One Understood You</em>.</p>","<p>Ali Noori is a doctoral student in religious studies at Penn.

the-abandoned,La Abandonada,The Abandoned,Gabriela Mistral,Perren Carrillo,"Ahora voy a aprenderme
el país de la acedía,
y a desaprender tu amor
que era la sola lengua mía,
como río que olvidase
lecho, corriente y orillas.

¿Por qué trajiste tesoros
si el olvido no acarrearías?
Todo me sobra y yo me sobro
como traje de fiesta para fiesta no habida;
¡tanto, Dios mío, que me sobra
mi vida desde el primer día!

Denme ahora las palabras
que no me dio la nodriza.
Las balbucearé demente
de la sílaba a la sílaba:
palabra “expolio,” palabra “nada,”
y palabra “postrimería,”
¡aunque se tuerzan en mi boca
como las víboras mordidas!

Me he sentado a mitad de la Tierra,
amor mío, a mitad de la vida,
a abrir mis venas y mi pecho,
a mondarme en granada viva,
y a romper la caoba roja
de mis huesos que te querían.

Estoy quemando lo que tuvimos:
los anchos muros, las altas vigas,
descuajando una por una
las doce puertas que abrías
y cegando a golpes de hacha
el aljibe de la alegría.

Voy a esparcir, voleada,
la cosecha ayer cogida,
a vaciar odres de vino
y a soltar aves cautivas;
a romper como mi cuerpo
los miembros de la “masía”
y a medir con brazos altos
la parva de las cenizas.

¡Cómo duele, cómo cuesta,
cómo eran las cosas divinas,
y no quieren morir, y se quejan muriendo,
y abren sus entrañas vívidas!
Los leños entienden y hablan,
el vino empinándose mira
y la banda de pájaros sube
torpe y rota como neblina.

Venga el viento, arda mi casa
mejor que bosque de resinas;
caigan rojos y sesgados
el molino y la torre madrina.
¡Mi noche, apurada del fuego,
mi pobre noche no llegue al día!","Now I am going to learn
the sour country,
and unlearn your love,
my only language,
like a river that neglects
its current, its edge, its bed.

Why did you gift me treasures
without the means to forget?
Everything passes me and I pass me
like a party dress for a party no one came to;
Too much, my God, too much.
My life has passed me since the first day.

Now you must give me the words
that my mother never could.
I will babble and blubber them
from syllable to syllable:
the word “plunder,” the word “nothing,”
the word “hell,”
although they writhe in my mouth
like bitten snakes.

I have sat
in the middle of the Earth,
my love, 
in the middle of my life,
to open up my veins and my chest,
to peel myself like a pomegranate,
and to break the red mahogany
of my bones that once ached for you.

I am burning all that we had:
the thick walls, the high rafters,
uprooting one by one
the twelve doors you liked to open,
taking an axe
to the well of happiness.

I am going to throw out
the harvest we reaped yesterday,
empty out the bottles of wine,
and free the caged birds;
I will dismember this homestead
as if it were my body,
the mountain of ashes
measured with fingers to the sky.

How dull the ache, how steep the cost,
how divine these things once were.
They don’t want to die: sniveling,
baring their vivid entrails!
The timbers understand and speak,
the wine pours itself to watch,
and the flock of birds rises
disjointed and slow like the fog.

May the wind come. May this house burn
brighter than a forest of matches;
May the mill and the watchtower
buckle, red and slanted.
My night, rushed by the fire,
my poor night, run away from the day!","<p>I began by doing a literal translation of the poem based on my own understanding of Spanish, the translations of “The Abandoned Woman” by Randall Conch and “Deserted” by Ursula Le Guin, and a Spanish-to-English dictionary. However, I wanted my translation to be just as intense, animated, impassioned, and senseless as the original, which a literal translation could never attain. In order to create a sense of reckless abandon in feeling and emotion, I took multiple liberties in order to evoke certain images or concepts.</p>
<p>For example, in lines 5 and 6 of my translation, “neglects” replaces “forgets.” Here, the speaker, like the river, has made a conscious choice to ignore herself to the point of harm because every part of her has become her lover. Furthermore, I chose “neglect” because each part of her and every word she speaks embodies her lover in such a way that the speaker cannot truly forget no matter how hard she tries. In fact, there is a paradoxical futility in even trying to forget; any active effort to repress something further recalls it.</p> <p>There were times also when words and concepts in Spanish did not translate literally into English, such as <em>postrimería</em> in line 18 of the original. This word is only found in Spanish and is used to describe the four afterlife occurrences according to Catholicism: death, judgment, hell, and glory. Le Guin translated the word as “afterwards” and Conch translated it as “waiting-for-death.” Personally, Le Guin better renders the afterlife in her translation whereas Conch veers away from that in rendering this ad hoc neologism for what the living feel towards the afterlife. I chose “hell” to relate to the connotations of death and the already condemning tone of the poem. This abandonment represents the death of their love, a death that condemned the speaker to hell — to the flames and fire and pain and viscera. I also feel that this was an appropriate choice because it relates back to the first two lines of the third stanza: “Now you must give me the words / that my mother never could.” After all, a mother would never give a child the word “hell.”</p>","<p>Gabriela Mistral (1889–1957) was a Chilean poet, diplomat, educator, and humanist. In 1945, she became the first Latin American author and fifth woman to receive a Nobel Prize in Literature. She had many passionate affairs with both men and women, with perhaps the recently published correspondence between her and Doris Dana being the premier example of both her great capacity for love (if not passion) and her defiance of gender roles and stereotypes that the Chilean government had imposed on her. Central to her poems are nature, betrayal, love, and remorse, as seen in the translated poem, “La Abandonada,” which comes from a collection called <em>Locas mujeres</em> (<em>Crazy Women</em> or <em>Madwomen</em>, depending on the English translation). This poem in particular deals with abandonment after love. Although the original abandonment of the speaker by her lover is the catalyst for the poem, it becomes apparent that at the forefront of the poem is the speaker’s madness, her abandonment of every sense — a madness more complex and more nuanced than it appears to be. She descends into a visceral insanity that engulfs the poem in the all encompassing redness of flames, of rage, of passion, but in a way that is completely her: complicatedly human.</p>","<p>I translated this poem as my final project in Taije Silverman’s class “The Translation of Poetry and the Poetry of Translation.” I study Spanish , French, and comparative literature in the College, so I am constantly translating between languages, authors, times, etc.</p>",Spanish,es,/assets/images/images_19/mistral.JPG,,photo by a <i>DoubleSpeak</i> staffer,,,,2019,submission

","In the corners of the city are 
Scattered, broken, aimless dreams
Of which the city-dwellers are unaware.
I wander the corners of the city, morning and night,
So that I might compile them,
Reignite them in the forge of my heart, 
Clear off old, accumulated dirt,
So that their hands and feet may emerge again,
Their lips and cheeks and necks arise with a sparkle,
Like the unfulfilled desires in the heart of a newly adorned groom 
That these dreams may again find direction.

“Dreams, get your dreams—,”
As morning comes, I go to the square and give my call. 
“Are the dreams real or counterfeit?”
They investigate as if 
There were no greater authority on dreams than them! 

A maker of dreams, I am neither
A maker of the second face, nothing more
Although, yes, the backbone of my livelihood is dreams

Evening comes,
Again, I give my call 
“Free, completely free, these dreams of gold”
Upon hearing “free,” people become even more fearful
And wordlessly move away
“Watch out; ‘free’ he says, 
Might it be a hoax?
A hidden trick?
That they might break upon reaching home, 
Or that these dreams might melt,
Fly away in a puff of air,
Or perform some sorcery upon us,
Oh no! What use are they?
These dreams of a mere scrap-dealer,
These dreams of a sightless scrap-dealer!”

Night falls,
With stacks of dreams resting upon my head,
I return with a dejected expression,
All night I again murmur,
“Take these dreams…
Take more…and take from me their cost as well…
Dreams, take these dreams…
My dreams…
Dreams oh my dreams…
Dreams…
Even their cost”","<p>The translator’s dilemma is truly a world apart. On one hand, you feel the purest form of joy, sharing something so powerful and evocative to a whole new class of readers; on the other, you feel immeasurable loss for all the nuance and connotation that you somehow could not put on paper. There are questions every translator wrestles with: How true should one remain to source material versus the understood meaning of the work? Should line breaks happen as they are, or reflect the thoughts in the translated tongue? Is punctuation to be adjusted depending on the end language?</p>
<p>In translating Noon Meem Rashid’s <span lang=""ur"">اندھا کباڑی</span> (“Blind Scrap-Dealer”), I quickly came to realize that Rashid’s sonic mastery was something I would never be able to capture in my end product — I thus opted to keep the line breaks exactly where they were, to at least preserve the original form. Surveying the analogies and abstractions Rashid uses (likening his heart to a forge, to the sparkling dreams of a groom), I attempted to capture, more artfully, the larger metaphors he constructs.</p> <p>Choosing the tenses of the verbs in the first stanza was an active choice to highlight the narrative Rashid composes of the speaker himself reinvigorating the dreams. 
Additionally, the notion of “the second face” was difficult to explain. Simply put, “the second face” implies an external representation or symbol. Essentially, the speaker is asserting that he simply burnishes and presents these dreams, giving them an external appearance, but is not responsible for the content, the essence of the dream itself. I thought it more appropriate to footnote this explanation than to change the expression that Rashidr uses.</p> 
<p>Without a doubt, the most difficult part of translation was the title and the subject of the poem. <span lang=""ur"">کباڑ</span>, in Urdu, roughly translates to “scraps” or “rubbish,” and one who collects said scraps and sells them is a <span lang=""ur"">کباڑی</span>. In Pakistan, such individuals wheel around their goods, hawking their wares to people. Thus follows the plot of the poem: this scrap-dealer, whose call for dreams exists in the same form of a milkman, fruit-seller, or any other street merchant who might be passing through. It was not even that the equivalent word did not exist, but that the very concept did not exist in the English language or Western culture. Rather than alter the fabric of the work, I chose to include this explanation instead.</p>","<p>Noon Meem Rashid (<span lang=""ur"">نذر مُحَمَّد راشِد</span>, 1910–1975) was a Pakistani poet and writer noted for his progressiveness and rich, adventurous use of language. He served in the Royal Indian Army, and, after Independence, worked with Radio Pakistan before going on to work for the UN for the remainder of his career. Writing at a time when much of Pakistan’s literary community was harkening back to the Arab roots of Urdu, Rashid chose to highlight the Persian influence on Pakistan and Urdu. His language is layered with modern Persian verbiage and displays a mastery of sound that defies simple explanation. This very poem has a rhythmic rise and fall, a natural flow of language that rolls like honey off the tongue. Coupled with the abstractness with which Rashid examined the topics of free will, oppression, love, and beauty, his work emerged as the first marker of “modernist” Urdu poetry. Rashid also became the first prominent user of free verse in Urdu poetry, rebelling against the traditional <em>ghazal</em> format in Urdu poetry. He passed away in 1975, at the age of sixty-five, and asked to be cremated after his death (as opposed to the traditional Muslim burial), a hard-line individualist till the end.</p>","<p>Armghan Ahmad is a senior in Wharton studying finance and marketing.

upon the boundaries between dream and real
i dwell on the margin of myself

how can i know if in this nowhere, 
where the voice frees itself,
if i came from myself
or was imposed.
","<p>This year, we include a chain translation done by the <i>DoubleSpeak</i> staff to demonstrate how many people can contribute to one translation. Each staff member translated about five lines, then we translated the last stanza together. We found it fascinating to watch the translation develop as each individual put in their own piece — aligning our own perception of the poem to the spirit of the poem itself <i>and</i> to others’ perceptions was challenging, but it allowed us to explore the boundaries of the self and others. We asked ourselves: How can we translate the poem’s focus on physicality? How can we capture the spirit of the language without any familiarity of its spirit? How would that spirit change our own expression?</p>
<p>The first line of the poem was difficult to translate. What exactly does it mean for one’s head to be “full of sky”? Is it whimsy at the nature of the world? A means of distraction? A reference to imagination and fleeting youth? Portrayals of nature’s beauty follow this “head in the sky,” with references to “wings of the sun,” “two rivers,” and “towers of sand,” alluding to nature’s magnificent power instead of the hands of humankind.</p>
<p>We also struggled with “I hid in the shade of day,” as the literal translation was “I was the color of day.” The sky is blue or white during the daytime but day seems like a colorless thing. So, we translated it as “I hid in the shade of day” because being the color of something colorless is the same as being invisible. Later in the stanza, the narrator mentions masks, so our translation makes the stanza more cohesive, even though the poem as a whole feels a bit fragmented.</p>
<p>Throughout the poem, the narrator grapples with her relation to the world around her. This is why we translated “j’étais dans la pensée du vent” — literally “I was in the thought of the wind” — as “the wind thought of me.” This decision places the narrator in a position of power: instead of being consumed by the wind, the wind makes the vulnerable decision to think of her.</p>
<p>Ultimately, through this process, we found ourselves each becoming a scrap of the translation and the poem becoming us.</p>","<p>Amina Saïd, born in Tunis in 1953, was raised by a Tunisian father and a French mother and grew up speaking both Arabic and French. A voracious reader of novels, Saïd began seriously writing after her middle school French teacher persuaded her to write poetry. She wrote poems throughout the remainder of her schooling and obtained her baccalaureate degree in Paris after moving to France with her family at the age of sixteen. Saïd continued to delve into the world of language during university, deciding to study English literature instead of forcing herself to choose between the literatures of her native languages. However, she still draws inspiration from both French and Arabic works. She started publishing her own poetry in her twenties and has translated novels by Francisco Sionil José. Her published works include collections of Tunisian folk tales and eight volumes of poetry which have been translated into Arabic, German, Italian, Spanish, and English. Honored in France with the Jean Malrieu Prize in 1989 and the Charles Vildrac Prize in 1994, Saïd has lived in Paris since 1978. She continues to write poetry and currently works as a journalist, often visiting her homeland of Tunis.</p>","<p><em>DoubleSpeak</em>’s editorial staff is a combination of strong individuals.

a-ballad-about-departing-for-heaven,Баллада об уходе в рай,A Ballad about Departing for Heaven,Vladimir Vysotskii,Dan Guralnik,"Вот твой билет. Вот твой вагон.
Всё в лучшем виде, одному тебе дано.
В цветном раю увидеть сон,
Трёхвековое непрерывное кино.

Всё позади. Уже сняты
Все отпечатки, контрабанды не берём.
Как херувим стерилен ты.
А класс второй — не высший класс — зато с бельём.

Вот и сбывается всё что пророчится.
Уходит поезд в небеса, счастливый путь!
Ах, как нам хочется, как всем нам хочется,
Не умереть, а именно уснуть!

Земной перрон, не унывай!
И не кричи: для наших воплей он оглох.
Один из нас уехал в рай,
Он встретит бога если есть какой-то бог.

Он передаст ему привет.
А позабудет — ничего, переживём!
Осталось нам не много лет,
Мы пошустрим, и, как положено, умрем.

Вот и сбывается всё что пророчится.
Уходит поезд в небеса, счастливый путь!
Ах, как нам хочется, как всем нам хочется,
Не умереть, а именно уснуть!

Не всем дано поспать в раю,
Но кое-что мы здесь успеем натворить.
Подраться, спеть — вот я пою! —
Другие любят, третьи думают любить.

Уйдут как ты в ничто без сна,
И сыновья, и внуки внуков в трех веках.
Не дай Господь, чтобы война,
А то мы правнуков оставим в дураках!

Вот и сбывается всё что пророчится.
Уходит поезд в небеса, счастливый путь!
Ах, как нам хочется, как всем нам хочется,
Не умереть, а именно уснуть!

Тебе плевать! И хоть бы хны:
Лежишь, миляга, принимаешь вечный кайф!
Что до меня, такой цены
Я б не дал даже за хороший книжный шкаф.

Разбудит Вас какой-то тип,
И впустит в мир, где в прошлом войны, вонь и рак.
Где побеждён Гонгконгский грип.
На всём готовеньком ты счастлив ли, дурак?

Ну а пока, звенит звонок.
Счастливый путь, храни тебя от всяких бед.
И если там и вправду Бог,
Ты всё-же вспомни, передай ему привет.","Here’s your ticket. There’s your car.
The best we’ve got, it’s all for you alone.
To visit heaven, dream in color
An endless iMax film for when you’re gone…
 
Now all’s arranged, your papers cleared,
No luggage? Good! We take none anyway.
You’re finger-printed, washed and rinsed.
The seat’s just coach, but it reclines so well!
  
All that’s foretold comes to transpire:
The Train for Heaven leaves: farewell, godspeed!
Oh, how we crave, how strongly we desire
Never to die, but gently fall asleep.
 
You, back on earth, do not despair!
And save your cries — we do not have his ear.
He’s bound for heaven, paid his fare,
He’ll meet his maker, if that maker’s here.
 
He’ll pass to god our best regards;
Should he forget, it’s not of much concern:
We don’t have long to stay alive;
We'll have some fun until the train returns.
 
All that’s foretold comes to transpire:
The Train for Heaven leaves: farewell, godspeed!
Oh, how we crave, how strongly we desire
Never to die, but gently fall asleep. 

Not everyone is heaven-bound.
Those left behind could still protest their fate:
Go start a brawl, or join my song,
Perhaps make love, or merely contemplate.
 
Like you, we’ll step into the void,
As our children, great-grandchildren stay behind
Oh god, I wish there won’t be wars
Or we will shamelessly have screwed them over now!

All that’s foretold comes to transpire:
The Train for Heaven leaves: farewell, godspeed!
Oh, how we crave, how strongly we desire
Never to die, but gently fall asleep.
 
You do not care! You will not budge –
Just lying there forever blissful and detached.
You’ve overpaid, if I’m to judge:
Even my library won’t fetch that much!
 
You’ll be awoken by some dude,
who’ll greet you to a world devoid of struggle, stench and dread. 
No wars, no plague, no solitude,
How happy can you be when all is ready-made?

Ah well, meanwhile, the whistle screams.
Godspeed! Let no harm come your way.
And, just perhaps, if god exists,
Do not forget to tell him we said, “Hey!”","<p>My translations grow out of a deep dissatisfaction with available translations of Vysotsky’s work into English. The better ones are so academic they remind me of a quote from Milos Forman’s <i>Amadeus</i>: “Come on now, be honest! Which one of you wouldn’t rather listen to his hairdresser than Hercules? Or Horatius, or Orpheus…people so lofty they sound as if they shit marble!” On one hand, knowing Russian as a mother tongue and having been raised on stories about the USSR — good and bad — and knowing scores of Vysotsky’s songs by heart makes it hard to believe that Vysotsky would ever approve of such <em>haut-couture</em> translations. On the other hand, Vysotsky’s gift for juggling the Russian language and harnessing its cultural references that span centuries of human experience make most fan-made translations too banal and discolored despite the earnest attempt to convey his emotional range.</p>
<p>My goal was to translate the poem while preserving its emotional range, rhythm, and measure, so it could be sung in English as a song to the same melody as the original and understood by my American friends and family. My solution was to make use of colloquial language, as you may have well noticed. Here are some notes/examples:</p>
<p>The chorus is still too academic. I’d love to see something simpler replace the “transpire”–“desire” pair, even more so when I think of the corresponding pair in the original (<em>sbyvaets’a/prorochits’a – hochets’a</em>), which is a simpler rhyme, based on the repetition of a ubiquitous suffix.</p>
<p>A few details in the song, such as those relating to the experience of boarding a long-range train in Russia (one aboard which you’re about to spend days to weeks, where you will require towels and linen, and you’d like those to be clean…), have been replaced with analogous, more contemporary, symbols of comfort that are also more available and/or relevant on this side of the Atlantic. Just one line (the fourth line of the second verse) is given for conveying the train experience, with Vysotsky counting on the listener to conjure up their own memories thereof; in the US, I think, it is easier to ask you to recall how much leg room you had on your latest flight…</p> 
<p>Similarly, the phrase <em>kakoj-to tip</em>, which could have been treated in standard English as a general reference to “some stranger” (and usually is, as a brief online search for translations of this song will demonstrate), is better conveyed by “some dude,” because the latter does carry with it the necessary modicum of repulsion/disrespect.</p>
<p>I am certain that better, much better, translations are possible. Perhaps my conclusion from working on this one should be that translation is not merely about rewriting sentences in another language: it is about the communication of whole experiences. In the case of Vladimir Vysotsky, who dedicated his writing to the experience of life by less fortunate people, and who finds his roots in the study of song in Russian criminal culture (<em>blatnye pesni</em>), translating his work into English may be better served by the loose and laden language of the American Midwest than by the standard, literary English language. My sincere thanks to the editorial team of <em>DoubleSpeak</em> for a very helpful discussion!</p>","<p>Vladimir Vysotskii (1938–1980) was an accomplished actor and one of the famous singer-songwriters of post-WWII Soviet culture who survived the blockade of Leningrad as a child and was greatly influenced by the societal and cultural effects of the Second World War. Having witnessed the crash of patriotic Stalinism as a teenager, the “warming” (<em>ottepel’</em>) of Khruschev times and finally, the “stagnation” (<em>zastoj</em>) during Brezhnev, Vysotskii, in his poetry and song, casts a wide net of empathy over the “simple folk” (<em>prostoj narod</em>) mocked by the Soviet intellectual elites, the homeless war orphans forced into crime, the millions of wounded and bereaved WWII soldiers, and the oppressed non-conformists (<em>inakomysl’aschij</em>) who were tortured and disposed of by a regime whose ends justified all means. Love, death, and the love and beauty of life are themes woven intricately into every poem written by Vysotskii, with his song renditions of these poems so emotionally overwhelming – even in his comical writing – that his resulting popularity made it impossible for the Soviet regime to suppress his concerts (which started out as unofficial “evenings with friends”) or even his calling out the most vile practices of Brezhnev’s regime, such as imprisonment of political foes in psychiatric wards (see, e.g., the song <em>Oshibka Vyshla</em>). What made him still acceptable in the Soviet regime may have been a deeper, non-trivial side of his longing for true freedom for his people, its young culture, and its ideals. The Soviet regime had made it impossible for him to look up to the West, in whose political culture he could see other, no less powerful, patterns of oppression (see songs <em>Temnota, Misteriya Hippi</em> and the most overt <em>Pesnya o mistere McKinley</em>).</p>","<p>My name is Dan Guralnik. I am a mathematician working on geometric/topological methods for knowledge representation at Kod*Lab (Penn ESE) and am with Robert Ghrist’s group at the department of mathematics. I was born in Israel in 1975, raised by my Russian-Jewish parents, who introduced me to Vysotskii when I was about nine (or was it ten?) years old. He was a hero to them.</p>
<p>I moved to the US at the age of thirty, my first six years spent in the “Bible Belt” (specifically Vanderbilt and the University of Oklahoma), where I learned many new things about English. This weekend is yet another anniversary of my dad’s passing (11/17/1939–10/20/2001) of lung cancer. Like every cool dude in his days (Vladimir Vysotskii included), Dad used to smoke a lot. The song I’ve attempted to translate here is the song I played for the small gathering at his funeral – a song celebrating life in what seems a singularly Russian way, painting heaven as the best of all worlds, save one: ours.</p>",Russian,ru,,,,,,,2019,submission

The collection from which these poems come is structured in a way that the poems become shorter and shorter until it culminates in a poem with a title but no text. My goal was to maintain the simplicity and fluidity of the syntax while creating alliteration when it felt organic. I refrained from using too many coordinating conjunctions to intimate the fluidity of the Arabic structure, because too many “ands” would sound clunky. An issue I struggle with when translating Arabic poetry into English is avoiding sounding archaic. While these poems are dreary, they are also supposed to be fresh and light, despite their heavy content. Arabic has a lot of possessive constructions which tend to sound stilted in English. So, I tried to avoid them and alternated with “ ’s “ contractions. Finally, the first poem uses a series of imperatives (“roam,” “attack,” “grind,” etc.). I’m not sure how to make that clearer in the English.</p>","<p>Khalil Hawi (1919–1982) was a prominent Lebanese poet known for his contribution to modernist Arabic poetry. Though literary critics agree that Hawi succeeded in creating a poetic style that was unique, they also criticized him for the grotesque and macabre imagery which permeates his poetry. Influenced by philosophy, religion, and politics, Hawi composed poetry that grappled with difficult questions of authenticity and modernity. But Hawi was a sensitive person. The impact of national defeat throughout Arab countries from the Fifties to the Eighties filled his poetry with a lingering malaise from which he was unable to break free. Hawi tragically took his own life in the summer of 1982 upon hearing news of Israel’s invasion of Lebanon during the 1975 civil war, which lasted twenty-five years. It is difficult not to read Hawi’s poetry in light of his suicide. However, buried deep within the harrowing and nightmarish images he wove together is a story of a disturbed individual who created a language capable of exploring the harshest complexities of human emotional landscapes. Hawi is revered within Arabic literary circles as someone who used poetry to look deep into the abyss where others dared not.</p>","<p>Rawad Wehbe is a PhD student in the department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at the University of Pennsylvania. He studies both pre-modern and modern Arabic literature with a focus on poetry. His decision to study Arabic as an undergraduate at UCLA to learn about his own culture and heritage as an Arab-American transformed into a dedication to explore new approaches to imagine, frame, read, and eventually teach, Arabic literature. He currently lives in Philadelphia, PA, but usually spends his summers in Lebanon, where he teaches Arabic at the American University of Beirut.</p>",Arabic,ar,/assets/images/images_19/hawi.jpeg,,photo by Rawad Wehbe,,,,2019,submission

                          1940, Fountain House","<p>This set of two poems are part of a longer cycle called <em>Requiem</em>, which Anna Akhmatova wrote during the Great Purge in Soviet Russia, 1936–1939. The cycle moves between Akhmatova’s personal suffering during that time — having a son imprisoned — and the suffering of the Russian people in general. Unique qualities of Akhmatova’s poetry include intimacy, intensity of emotion, and a terseness; these are present in this cycle as well. <em>Crucifixion</em> comes near the end of cycle and veers away from the situation in Russia into a biblical scene. The basic parallel is clear: that of a mother’s loss of her son. Interpretations of this parallel are hazier, however. Is the stoicism of the M/mother thrust upon her, or chosen?</p>

<p>One of the more daring choices I made in this translation is not to render the beloved disciple’s expression literally. In the original, the disciple <em>kamenel</em>, a passive, reflexive verb that means “became petrified”; that is, he turned cold and blank as stone. The passive tense of the word is important, because the responses of the disciple and Mary are meant to be understood as involuntary reactions. However, in English it is impossible to render the word in a passive tense without using the word “was” or “becomes.” “Was petrified” misses the physical aspect; it can refer simply to fear. It also loses the gradual, in-the-moment component of “becoming;” however, “became petrified” sounds clunky. It seemed important that Mary Magdalene and the disciple have some reaction that is involuntary, in-the-moment, and physical. This would contrast with the voluntary physical act of looking that the narrator points out they did not do in the presence of a newly grieving mother. Therefore, I chose to change the image: I used “turned blank as a book,” hoping that that would convey some feeling of petrification, while keeping the reaction involuntary, gradual, and physical, to set up the contrast.</p>","<p>Anna Akhmatova (1889–1966) was an acclaimed Russian poet of the “Silver Age” of Russian poetry, the first half of the twentieth century. After moving to St. Petersburg, Akhmatova became part of the Acmeists, a literary group of six people who attempted to write poetry in traditional forms that focused on the objects and incidents of everyday life, in contrast with the highly experimental poetry in fashion at the time. In the post-revolutionary years, Akhmatova’s former husband Nikolai Gumilev was shot, her son Lev was imprisoned and exiled to Siberia, and her close friend Osip Mandelstam was arrested, exiled, and killed in a labor camp. <em>Requiem</em>, along with many other poems, was a response to those times. Beginning in 1925, Akhmatova’s poetry was banned by the Soviet government; even when the official ban was lifted, an implicit ban remained. Still, her poetry circulated orally and on scraps of paper that were burned upon reading. Akhmatova is seen as a mother of the modern Russian voice. She is also known as one of the only well-known poets to outlive the Stalinist era, stay in Russia, and chronicle those times.</p>","<p>Yehudith Dashevsky is an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania studying English literature with a concentration in Poetry and Poetics.

This is why I kept a very direct translation in all but a few cases.</p> <p>However, there are a few lines and words I struggled with. Lines like “Aber das Gras / ist schon gelb über dir.” were tricky. It’s a seemingly direct statement, but even in German this sentiment comes off as odd or uncommon. I translated it into English with a phrase less bizarre to English ears, but I think I could still find a better way of making the line sound as striking and unfamiliar in English as it does in German. <em>Distelsamen</em> was also difficult for me to translate. <em>Distelsamen</em> literally translates to “thistledown” in English, but most English speakers don’t know what thistledown is, while most German speakers know or assume what <em>Distelsamen</em> is (though I might have to check with a larger sample size on this). I initially translated <em>Distelsamen</em> as “pollen,” although thistledown isn’t pollen. Thistledown are the little white fuzzy things that drift in the air duringfall. Most people know exactly what this is, but don’t have a word for it, or would guess that they’re from dandelions, which also isn’t true. Additionally, the word <em>schattenfussig</em> is of typical German construction — part of the beauty of the language — but awkward in English. It literally means “shadowfooted,” which isn’t a word in English and doesn’t reflect common adjective constructions in the language either.</p> <p>On the other hand, there were also many victories in my translation. I was impressed with how beautiful “Autumn Eyes” sounds in English, which really does “Herbstaugen” justice. I was also very happy with how the plain and immediate language of the poem in German fit well structurally in the shape and length of the English translation. A problem with translating German is that, due to word construction freedoms, a single German word can correspond to a whole sentence or phrase in English. Usually, such lengthiness can potentially botch the flow of a poem, but the English translation turned out nicely. Overall, I tried to translate this poem with the natural, concrete language and emotions that I feel when reading it in German.</p>","<p>In 1909, Hilde Domin was born as Hilde Löwenstein in Cologne to a Jewish family. She began her university studies in law and economics, then studied philosophy and political science. In Germany, she studied in Heidelberg, Cologne, and Berlin. However, Domin’s Jewish background and socialist involvement were good reason to leave Germany in 1932. She moved to Italy, where she received her PhD in political science in Florence. There, she met her future husband, Erwin Palm. The two survived “literally on language” — Domin taught language courses and translated the scholarly writings of her husband. In 1939, the couple fled to Santo Domingo. The city’s name inspired the last name of Domin’s pen name, “Domin.” In Santo Domingo, Domin’s husband became an art history professor and she began writing in German as an “alternative to suicide.” The terrifying paradox of her life was that she had escaped to an island paradise while many of her friends and family were forced into hell on Earth. After the war, Domin moved back to Heidelberg where she became a professor and lived until her death. Notably, she was a very close friend of her fellow poet Nelly Sachs. The two exchanged letters while both in exile — Domin in Santo Domingo and Sachs in Sweden.</p>","<p>Dillon is a junior majoring in comparative literature.

Without the same experiences, I will never be able to fully express the thoughts of Yun Dong-ju while writing this poem, as he was truly in pain at the time he was living in Japan, the another’s country. However, I did make some choices in an attempt to recreate his experience. For example, the line, “a room of six <em>tatami</em> mats in another’s country,” is a reference to Yun’s college years in university while in Japan, which colonized Korea during this time. The tatami mat is a classic material and style of flooring that Japan had and is very unique to that country and culture. Therefore, I wanted to keep this word first because there is no other word in English to describe it, and second, to include the history of the Japanese colonization of Korea. Additionally, the lines “For what / do I sink alone?” are shortened from the original lines, which literally state “I expect what / Just I, alone sinking?” These lines really drove home the pure feeling of being alone, and though I changed the literal translation, I wanted to maintain the simplicity and absolute emptiness throughout the poem. Again, the moments of nostalgia and of loneliness are so seamlessly connected and embedded in the original, which made producing the same feelings incredibly difficult.</p>","<p>Yun Dong-ju (<span lang=""ko"">윤동주</span>) is a Korean poet who was born in 1917 In Myeongdong Village of Jilin in China and died in 1945 at the age of twenty-seven in Fukuoka, Japan. From 1910 to 1945, Korea was colonized by Japan and underwent “cultural cleansing,” which was enacted through a series of unfair and often violent methods. Korea people were prohibited to speak Korean, write in Korean, own Korean books, teach and learn in Korean, and hold their Korean names. It soon became dangerous for Yun to write in Korean, as it was interpreted by the Japanese to be a rebellion. Yun’s older cousin, Song Mongyu, was a huge influence in his life as well. As a talented prose writer and an activist in the Korean independence movement, Song himself worked with Yun and a few other college friends to create literary magazines back in Yeonhi University, which is now Yeonsae University. Song likely instilled in Yun the desire to refuse complete submission from the Japanese rule by continuing to write the Korean poetry he loved so much. Upon completing his education there, he moved to Rikkyo University in Tokyo and then transferred six months later to Doshisha University in Kyoto, where he was soon taken captive by the Japanese police to Fukushima prison, where he died, most likely as a victim of medical experiments. Yun never was able to publish his collection of poems, <em>Star, Sky, Wind, and Poetry</em>, because he was arrested as a revolutionary activist, but because he had given them to a close friend in Korea, Chong Pyong-uk, to hide until it was able to be published, Yun’s poems exist today for many to read.</p>","<p>Nadia Park is a senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying communication and minoring in consumer psychology and French.

song-for-helen,Chanson pour Hélène,Song for Helen,Pierre de Ronsard,Saagar Asnani,"Quand je devise assis aupres de vous,
        	Out le cœur me tressaut :
Je tremble tout de nerfs et de genous,
Et le pouls me defaut.
Je n’ay ny sang ny esprit ny haleine,
Qui ne se trouble en voyant mon Heleine,
        	Ma chere et douce peine.
 
Je devien fol, je perds toute raison :
Cognoistre je puis
Si je suis libre, ou captif en prison
        	Plus en moy je ne suis.
En vous voyant, mon œil perd cognoissance :
Le vostre altere et change mon essence,
        	Tant il a de puissance
 
Vostre beauté me fait en mesme temps
        	Souffrir cent passions :
Et toutesfois tous mes sens sont contents,
        	Divers d’affections.
L’œil vous regarde, et d’autre part l’oreille
Oyt vostre voix, qui n’a point de pareille,
        	Du monde la merveille.
 
Voyla comment vous m’avez enchanté,
Heureux de mon malheur :
De mon travail je me sens contenté,
        	Tant j’aime ma douleur :
Et veux tousjours que le torment me tienne,
Et que de vous tousjours il me souvienne,
        	Vous donnant l’ame mienne.
 
Donce ne cherechez de parler au Devin,
Qui sçavez tout charmer :
Vous seule auriez un esprit tout divin,
Si vous pouviez aimer.
Que pleust à Dieu, ma moitié bien-aimée
Qu’Amour vous eust d’une fleche enflammee
Autant que moy charmee.
 
En se jouant il m’a de part en part
        	Le cœur outrepercé :
A vous s’amie il n’a monstré le dart
        	Duquel il m’a blessé.
De telle mort heureux je me confesse,
Et ne veux point que le soucy me laisse
        	Pour vous, belle Maistresse.
 
Dessus ma tombe escrivez mon soucy
        	En lettres grossement :
Le Vendomois, lequel respose icy,
        	Mourut en bien aimant.
Comme Pâris, là bas faut que je voise,
Non pour l’amour d’une Helene Gregeoise,
        	Mais d’une Saintongeoise.","When I imagine myself seated beside you,
                My heart leaps from its place:
I tremble from my every limb,
                And my pulse fails me.
I have neither blood, nor soul, nor breath,
That remains untroubled when I see my Helen,
My dear and sweet pain.
 
I become mad, I lose all reason:
                I cannot know
If I am free, or captive in prison:
                I am no longer myself.
When I see you, mine eye sees naught else:
Whilst yours alters and changes my soul,
                So powerful is your gaze.
 
Your beauty makes me at once
                Suffer a hundred passions
All the while all my senses are content
Devoid of any ardor.
Mine eye sees you, whereas mine ear
Hears your voice, which has no peer
                In this world, and marvels.
 
It is thus that you have enchanted me,
                Joyful in my sorrow:
I am contented with my work,
                Such is my love for my own sadness:
I wish always for torment to grasp me,
And for me to forever remember you,
                Giving unto you my own soul.
 
Therefore, look no longer to the words of the Prophet,
                Who knows how best to charm:
You alone would have a wholly divine spirit,
                If you could have loved.
If God so pleased, my cherished better half,
If only Love had inflamed your heart
                With the arrow that charmed mine.
 
In his game, Love has most completely
                Pierced my heart:
To you, his friend, he has not shown the dart
                With which he has injured me.
I confess myself to be such a victim,
Yet do not wish to diminish my love
                For you, graceful Madame.
 
Above my tomb write of my love
                In letters bold and large:
The Vendômois, who rests here,
                Died whilst truly loving.
As did Paris, there I must see it was,
Not for the love of a Grecian Helen,
But for that of a Saintongeoise.","<p>Helen of Sparta, daughter of Zeus and a woman whose beauty was of mythic proportions, is often portrayed as the reason behind the fall of Troy, her irresistible allure causing conflict between the Greeks and Trojans over possession of her person. In this <em>chanson</em> or song, Ronsard has written an ode to Helen, describing her unparalleled beauty. However, in doing so, he has made use of a very interesting vocabulary, constantly linking the narrator’s adoration of her striking good looks to his own terrors, fears, unhappiness, and injuries. According to Ronsard, does Helen truly represent the pinnacle of human beauty, and if so, is this beauty something for which we are to strive? Her ravishing appearance has caused the downfall of many men and the narrator’s admiration of the wonders of her visage seems to be causing him physical and mental pain. The last stanza is particularly telling, as he then links this mythic metaphor to a more tangible example, his love for a woman, hailing from Saintonge, who seems to have rejected his advances.</p>
 
<p>Appearing in the volume <em>Les Amours</em>, a collection of sonnets, chansons, madrigals, and other poems dedicated to the topic of love and often based on mythical ideas, this poem is a truly well-written and beautiful example of Ronsard’s subtle mastery of the language of poetry and love. In this translation, I have opted to stay as close to the original meaning as possible. I have not tried to carry through the syllabic meter and rhyme scheme of the original, focusing instead on the content of the poem. Ronsard’s original was highly conscient of the form and style in which it was written, with a very strict alternance of decasyllabic and hexasyllabic lines and a clear ABABCCC rhyme scheme in each stanza.</p>
 
<p>I would like to thank Prof. Scott Francis of the French and Francophone Studies department for his help in editing my translation.</p>","<p>Pierre de Ronsard was born in 1524 in Couture-Sur-Loir, a small village on the banks of the Loir River. After completing his education in Paris, he made a name for himself as a master poet. He often found work as a translator of classical works into vernacular French, and the influence of ancient myths is apparent in the subject matter of his poetry. Forming lifelong friendships with other popular poets of the era, he and six others joined together to form <em>la Pléiade</em>, a group of seven poets who were bound by stylistic, topical, and philosophical ideas of writing. Ronsard was a founding member of the group and has since been known as one of the greatest lyricists of French history. Today, while <em>la Pléiade</em> forms an essential part of the French literary canon and is studied by French literature students of all levels, it is almost unknown in the realm of English literature. Given the genius of Ronsard’s writings and his delicate touch with the French language, it seems only fitting that his works reach a wider audience.</p>","<p>Saagar Asnani is a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences at Penn triple majoring in biology, French, and music. An avid Francophile at heart, he has always been fascinated by the beauty of the language, France’s cultural contributions to modern society, and its rich history. Given his love of Medieval and Renaissance French literature, he hopes to continue to translate various works from Old and Middle French into English and make these masterpieces accessible to a wider audience. In addition to translation, he is an avid performer, and can often be seen on campus carrying his viola to rehearsals and concerts. After Penn, he intends to attend medical school.</p>",French,fr,,,,,,,2019,submission
paper-crane,纸鸽,Paper Crane,Li Yuansheng,Yi Feng,"没法折出那种简单好看的纸鸽
我总是把自己的犹豫
和周围的夜色一起折进去


把它放在孩子床边
就像留下一封兴之所至的短信
里面有被琴声慢慢举到空中的牧场

可爱的小小玻璃房子        
当秋天挟带的石块滚过屋顶

Always, I fold it with my own hesitation
and with the shades of night

I put it besides a child’s bed
as if to leave a spontaneous short letter 
Inside it, there is a meadow slowly lifted into                         
the sky with the melody of music

On days of the deepest folds
and of a nice silly man sitting before the arrival of spring                  
                                         
I cannot fold that kind of simple and pretty paper crane
Even in front of a table piled with pieces of paper
In this quiet factory workshop
labor still drags its subtle shadow

Will the smiling children 
accept the secret in it 
When rocks brought by the autumn roll over the roof        
of this little lovely glassy house
will every piece of glass remain intact","<p>I love this short poem by Li Yuansheng because it reminds me of my own experience of folding paper cranes for loved ones. This poem also reminds me of Robert Duncan’s poem “Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow” and the novel <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>. The literary translation of the title “<span lang=""zh"">纸鸽</span>” is “paper dove,” but I used “paper crane,” since “paper crane” is commonly recognized as a cultural element in China and worldwide and is most likely what the poem refers to. In China, people used to fold as many paper cranes as possible to pass on as gifts of best wishes or tokens of love to dear friends or significant others. This custom has largely died out due to the fast speed of life. I translated this poem using direct translation and everyday language to reflect its poetic style. Also, in the last three lines, I shifted the original order of the lines and added a proposition “of” in order to connect these lines in meaning as well as to narrow down the gap between the two languages. The last three lines in the original poem are: “The little lovely glassy house (<span lang=""zh"">可爱的小小玻璃房子</span>) / When rocks brought by the autumn roll over the roof (<span lang=""zh"">当秋天挟带的石块滚过屋顶</span>) / will every piece of glass remain intact (<span lang=""zh"">每一块玻璃是否能完好无损</span>)”. Li is a well-known poet in China, but his poetry collections have not yet been translated into English. I hope that my translation will make more people interested in reading Li’s poems.</p>","<p>Li Yuansheng was born in Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, where poetry is deeply rooted in the local culture and life. Li graduated from Chongqing University in 1983. After graduation, he worked as the general editor for the <em>Chongqing Daily</em>.

here-i-love-you,Aquí te amo,Here I Love You,Pablo Neruda,Stephanie Diaz,"Aquí te amo. 
En los oscuros pinos se desenreda el viento. 
Fosforece la luna sobre las aguas errantes. 
Andan días iguales persiguiéndose. 

Se desciñe la niebla en danzantes figuras. 
Una gaviota de plata se descuelga del ocaso. 
A veces una vela. Altas, altas estrellas. 

O la cruz negra de un barco. 
Solo. 
A veces amanezco, y hasta mi alma está húmeda. 
Suena, resuena el mar lejano. 
Este es un puerto. 
Aquí te amo. 

Aquí te amo y en vano te oculta el horizonte. 
Te estoy amando aún entre estas frías cosas. 
A veces van mis besos en esos barcos graves, 
que corren por el mar hacia donde no llegan. 
Ya me veo olvidado como estas viejas anclas. 
Son más tristes los muelles cuando atraca la tarde. 
Se fatiga mi vida inútilmente hambrienta. 
Amo lo que no tengo. Estás tú tan distante. 
Mi hastío forcejea con los lentos crepúsculos. 
Pero la noche llega y comienza a cantarme. 
La luna hace girar su rodaje de sueño. 

Me miran con tus ojos las estrellas más grandes. 
Y como yo te amo, los pinos en el viento,
quieren cantar tu nombre con sus hojas de alambre.","Here I love you.
In the dark pines the wind untangles itself.
The moon radiates over the roaming waters.
Identical days chase after each other.

Fog loosens into dancing figures.
A silver seagull unhooks from the sunset.
Sometimes a sail. High, high stars.

Or the black cross of a boat.
Alone.
Sometimes I wake and even my soul is damp.
The faraway sea sounds and resounds.
This is a port.
Here I love you.

Here I love you and in vain the horizon hides you.
I am loving you still among these frozen things.
Sometimes my kisses leave in those grave boats,
which run towards a sea they never reach.
I find myself already forgotten like these old anchors.
The piers are sadder when the night docks.
My uselessly starving life grows tired.
I love what I do not have. You are so distant.
My weariness wrestles with slow twilights.
But night arrives and starts its serenade.
The moon spins her clockwork dreams. 

The greatest stars look at me with your eyes.
And because I love you, the pines in the wind, 
long to sing your name with their wire leaves.","<p>Neruda’s “Aquí te amo” is a playground of images shifting from darkness of the trees in the opening line to phosphorescence of the moon in the next. The visuals that Neruda provides, coupled with the sense of touch that <em>la niebla</em> and <em>húmeda</em> evoke, make the original an in-depth and lyrical experience, which I tried to capture in my translation. The issue I encountered and re-encounter every time I revisit this translation is the use of the phrase “I love you.” This staple of the English language has often seemed overused to me, as though it does not carry the weight or connotation that it should. I realized, however, that this did in some ways play into the meaning that I saw in the original — not because Neruda’s <em>aquì te amo</em> is meaningless or trivial, but rather because it is simple. The line holds a certain immediacy that is not urgent or impatient but frank, honest, and pure, which I felt I would lose with a phrase other than our English equivalent.</p>","<p>Pablo Neruda, born in 1904, was a Chilean poet and diplomat who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971. Neruda’s works include poems such as “Aquí te amo” as well as epics, an autobiography, and manifestos. Despite his success in Chile and around the world, Neruda remains lesser-known in the United States —perhaps due to his politics, specifically his close ties to the Communist Party. In his youth, Neruda was guided by Gabriela Mistral, a Chilean writer who took note of Neruda’s talent and mentored him.</p>","<p>Stephanie Diaz is a junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying French and Francophone studies, with minors in art history and sociology.

Each stanza is made up of two lines and the last syllable of each stanza must rhyme with the last syllable of the first line of the next stanza. It may sound complicated, but <em>Kapyani 11</em> is actually one of the simplest forms of Thai poetry. Below is a further illustration of the <em>Kapyani 11</em> style.

<p>As is seen above, the fifth and the eighth syllables of each line rhyme,\ and the eleventh syllable of the first line of the couplet continues the scheme by rhyming with the fifth syllable of the second line.</p> <p>We chose to translate the poem into couplets because they are simple and easy to read. We kept the use of the pronouns “she” and “her” as in the original, as well as the use of a flower to symbolize women and womanhood. We adapted many of the Thai idioms with devices or constructions of similar semantic and visual value in English, such as “She is not bewitched by golden fleece” or “to decide for whom to show her blossom.” In Thai, the two phrases literally mean “She is not excited by beautiful clothes” and “Not men’s banquet,” respectively. In English, the use of the literal phrases would drastically reduce the intelligibility of the translation while also depriving the reader of the original’s visual intensity. Hence, we endeavored to make the literary imagery as sharp in translation as in the original, while doing our best to preserve the sense of sound and rhythm that gives the poem its full power.</p>","<p>Chiranan Pitpreecha is a famous Thai writer and poet. She was a student at Chulalongkorn University and was one of the leaders of the October 1973 pro-democracy student movement against the military government in Thailand. She, with thousands of other Thai students, fled to the jungle in the aftermath of the October 6, 1976, massacre at Thammasat University, Thailand’s “Tiananmen Square” moment. During the massacre, the Royal Thai Police, the Royal Thai Border Police, the Royal Thai Military, and civilian paramilitary forces surrounded and invaded the Thammasat University campus under “free-fire” orders, resulting in the deaths of an untold number of unarmed student protesters, many of whom were killed trying to surrender to authorities. Their bodies were hung from the trees on campus and left for the public to deface. Pitpreecha later joined the Communist insurrection as well.
