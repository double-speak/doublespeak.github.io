the-other-girl,L’autre fille,The Other Girl,Annie Ernaux,Jackson Gu,"D’après l’état civil tu es ma sœur. Tu portes le même patronyme que le mien, mon nom de « jeune fille », Duchesne. Dans le livret de famille des parents presque en lambeaux, à la rubrique Naissance et Décès des Enfants issus du Mariage, nous figurons l’une au-dessous de l’autre. Toi en haut avec deux tampons de la mairie de Lillebonne (Seine-Inférieure), moi avec un seul — c’est dans un autre livret officiel que sera remplie pour moi la case décès, celui qui atteste de ma reproduction d’une famille, avec un autre nom.
 
Mais tu n’es pas ma sœur, tu ne l’as jamais été. Nous n’avons pas joué, mangé, dormi ensemble. Je ne t’ai jamais touchée, embrassée. Je ne connais pas la couleur de tes yeux. Je ne t’ai jamais vue. Tu es sans corps, sans voix, juste une image plate sur quelques photos en noir et blanc. Je n’ai pas de mémoire de toi. Tu étais déjà morte depuis deux ans et demi quand je suis née. Tu es l’enfant du ciel, la petite fille invisible dont on ne parlait jamais, l’absente de toutes les conversations. Le secret.","According to official records, we are sisters. We bear the same name, my maiden name, Duchesne. In our family’s tattered record book, under the category of Legitimate Children Born and Deceased, we appear one above the other: you above with two stamps from the city hall of Lille-bonne (Seine-Inférieure) and me below with one. My “deceased” box will be stamped in another book that belongs to the family I will have started under a different name.
 
But you are not my sister. You never were. We have never played together, eaten together, or slept together. I have never felt you or kissed you. I do not know the color of your eyes. I have never seen you. You are without body and voice. I have a few black-and-white photos of you but no memories. You had been dead two years by the time I was born. You are a child of the heavens, the invisible little girl of whom we never spoke, absent from all conversations. The secret.","​<p>During the translation process, I tried to stay as true as possible to the structure of the original text. Several modulations were necessary, as French employs the preposition “of” much more frequently than does English. However, repeated use of “of” sounds heavy in English. Another notable feature is verb tense. The French passé composé tense can be translated as either the simple past tense or the present perfect tense in English. In the second paragraph of the excerpt, the author repeatedly uses passé composé, so I carefully considered which English equivalent more accurately conveys the meaning. Both are perfectly viable options, but I decided on the present perfect to emphasize past pain that lingers in the present. Though short and deceivingly simple, the excerpt required careful consideration, as every word conveys the feelings of disheartenment and inferiority felt by the narrator.</p>","<p>French author Annie Ernaux spent her childhood in Yvetot, Normandy. Her works are often based on personal experiences. In 1984 she won the Prix Renaudot for her novel <em>La place (A Man’s Place)</em>, a narrative in which she recounts her relationship with her father. Many of her works have been translated into English. <em>L’autre fille (The Other Girl)</em> is a short autobiographical novel in which Ernaux describes how she lived her childhood in the shadow of an older sister who had died before Ernaux was born. Her parents kept the secret from her, but over the years hints and photos led her to the truth. She realized she was a replacement that would never measure up.</p>","<p>Jackson Gu is a sophomore majoring in economics and French at the University of Pennsylvania. Raised in Canada, he was exposed to French at an early age, but it wasn’t until his junior year of high school that he discovered his passion for the language.</p>",French,fr,,,,,,,2015,submission
abend,Abend,Abend,Rainer Maria Rilke,Michaela Kotziers,"Der Abend wechselt langsam die Gewänder,
die ihm ein Rand von alten Bäumen hält;
du schaust: und von dir scheiden sich die Länder,
ein himmelfahrendes und eins, das fällt;

und lassen dich, zu keinem ganz gehörend,
nicht ganz so dunkel wie das Haus, das schweigt,
nicht ganz so sicher Ewiges beschwörend
wie das, was Stern wird jede Nacht und steigt—

und lassen dir (unsäglich zu entwirrn)
dein Leben band und riesenhaft und reifend,
so dass es, bald begrenzt und bald begreifend,
abwechselnd Stein in dir wird und Gestirn.","The day returns, slowly, its clothes 
that belong to the sun, 
evening giving new darkness 
to the legs of old trees.
You look, 
and in your eyes these hours part,
one skyward traveling, one descending;

neither claims you whole. 
They leave you
not so entirely dark as that house,
that one silent over there,
not so entirely sure in prolonged longing
as that thing, 
that every-night star that rises

and lowers to you (unspeakably entwined)
your life 
shaken, roaring, but ripened
so that soon bound, soon understanding, 
it tumbles in you 
stone to stardust, stardust to stone.","<p>My translation does not mirror Rilke’s formal verse, but it does stay true to the original’s simple vocabulary to describe the everyday scene of evening. What I found most interesting and did preserve was Rilke’s syntax — long sentences that spill from one line and stanza to the next, imitating the way in which <em>Abend</em> (“evening”) is both the day and night, two <em>Länder</em> (“worlds”) blending into one another, rather than two independent beings. “Evening” would be a literal translation of <em>Abend</em>, but I felt that the original’s title of <em>Abend</em> encompasses the feeling of the poem rather than simply designating the time of day in which the poem takes place. In trying to find an English word that was more nuanced than what I find to be our understanding of “evening,” “twilight” came to mind, with its blurred borders of night and day, but the sound of the word wasn’t right. So, as an instance of untranslatability, <em>Abend</em> remains in German for my title. This poem could be placed with Rilke’s <em>Dinggedichte</em> (“thing poems”), which search to explain the human through the non-human.</p>","<p>Rainer Maria Rilke was a modern German-language poet, intensely lyrical in his writing. With his experiments of syntax and images, collections of Rilke’s poetry work towards a philosophy of objective impressions, and truths of human life. Perhaps his most well known books of poetry are <em>Neue Gedichte</em> (<em>New Poems</em>) and <em>Duino Elegies</em>, the second of which was said to “have had as much influence in German-speaking countries as [T. S. Eliot’s] <em>The Waste Land</em> has in England and America.”<p> ","<p>Michaela Kotziers began writing poetry in her first year of college and has since taken interest in translation, especially that of Old English poetry and with experiments in form.</p>",German,de,/assets/images/images_15/IMG_0524.JPG,,,,,,2015,submission
loneliness,Einsamkeit,Loneliness,Rainer Maria Rilke,Claris Park,"Die Einsamkeit ist wie ein Regen.
Sie steigt vom Meer den Abenden entgegen;
von Ebenen, die fern sind und entlegen,
geht sie zum Himmel, der sie immer hat.
Und erst vom Himmel fällt sie auf die Stadt.

Regnet hernieder in den Zwitterstunden,
wenn sich nach Morgen wenden alle Gassen
und wenn die Leiber, welche nichts gefunden,
enttauscht und traurig von einander lassen;
und wenn die Menschen, die einander hassen,
in einem Bett zusammen schlafen müssen:

dann geht die Einsamkeit mit den Flüssen…


고독은 비와도 같은 것
저녁을 찾아 바다에서 오른다.
멸고 먼 외진 들녘에서 오른다
늘상 고적하기만 한 하늘로 옮겨갔다가
하늘에서 비로소 도시에 내린다.

아침을 향해 골목골목이 몸을 일으키고
아무것도 찾아내지 못한 욕신들이
실망과 슬픔에 젖어 서로 떠나갈 때,
서로 미워하는 사람들이
같은 잠자리에서 함께 잠들어야 할 때,
낮과 밤이 뒤엉킨 시각, 비가 되어 내리면

고독은 강물과 함께 흘러간다…..

","Loneliness is like a rainfall. 
She rises from the sea against the night; 
from far and distant plains,
she travels to the Heavens, who had always held her.

She rains downward in the indistinguishable hours, 
when all alleyways turn into each after morning, 
and when the bodies, which have found nothing,
depart from one another wet with dissapointment and sadness;
and when people who hate each other
must slumber together in one bed:

Loneliness flows with the river waters...","<p>When I first encountered “Einsamkeit,” I actually read this anonymous translation of it in Korean. When I read the original German, and later an English translation, I found that the English failed to capture certain qualities and meanings that I considered essential in the Korean translation. Thus I translated “Einsamkeit” from the Korean, to try to capture some of these missing qualities that I believe make the poem so simple and reverberating.</p>","<p>Rainer Maria Rilke (1875–1926) was a Bohemian poet and novelist who is widely regarded as one of the most lyrically intense German-language poets, and his works have been characterized as mystical and haunting.</p>","Claris Park is a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in Theater Arts and hoping to double major in English.",German,de,,,,,,,2015,submission

and I will tell you
how the highest of dreams
came to me at midnight
when all voices
were hushed in sleep.
It seemed I saw
a wondrous tree ascending into Heaven — sheathed in stars, wreathed in gold, of beacons brightest. Gemstones studded all the corners 
of the Earth; and the five finest adorned 
the cross-beam. All beings fair beheld there, 
by eternal decree, the Angel of the Lord. 
This was no criminal’s gallows; but guarded 
by Holy Spirits, worshipped by men and all 
of glorious Creation.  Proud stood
the Tree of Victory and I, sin-stained, worry-wounded, 
beheld it there: robed in light, shining with joys, gilded. 
Yet beneath the gold
there stirred — I could perceive —
a struggle still, 
the wretched grasping; 
as blood began to pour
down its right flank.
I was wrenched
with sorrow,
cowering
before the beautiful sight.
I saw that blazing beacon
shift its skin;
one moment soaked with sweat,
weeping blood,
the next armored in treasure.
It seemed as though
I lay there an eternity, 
tortured, 
sole witness to the Savior’s tree,
until at once
I heard that forest’s King
begin to speak:
“I remember the dawn,
so long ago,
when from the edge of the woods
I was hewn down by men,
ripped from my roots.
I was made a spectacle
by cruel enemies, 
commanded
to raise up criminals.”</span>","<p>This is a translation of the first thirty-one lines of “The Dream of the Rood,” believed to be the oldest Anglo-Saxon poem. I chose to focus my translation on the physicality and shifting nature of the Rood itself. The most significant change I made to the poem in order to highlight this physicality was to arrange the lines so that they created the shape of a cross. I wanted the poem to emulate the Ruthwell Monument, in which form and content are similarly united. The cross is only clearly defined on the left side, with the right side (where the Rood begins to bleed) left uneven, as though in the process of shifting its shape or dissolving. This emphasizes the constantly changing identity of the Rood — one moment a tree, the next moment a cross, and given a human voice throughout.</p>
<p>I also used language within the poem to bring out the multiplicity of the Rood’s nature, using the words and phrases “robed,” “flank,” “soaked with sweat,” “weeping blood,” and “armored” to suggest that the Rood itself also symbolizes a human body capable of both joy and suffering. In addition, I attempted to create yet another form for the Rood — that of a sword — by using the word “sheathed.” The Rood is a warrior, just as Christ — as described in this poem — is a warrior, not a meek victim. The Rood’s own story and body parallel the story and body of Christ: a lowly origin, suffering inflicted by malicious men and courageously endured, and a glorious finale as a worshiped figure ascending into heaven.</p>","<p>The original text of the poem dates back to the eighth century, and its author (or authors) is unknown.</p>","<p>Ayla Fudala is a student at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in English and environmental studies.

cormorant,Cormorán,Cormorant,Pablo Neruda,Gregorio Doblehablante,"Crucificado en la roca,
inmóvil cruz de pelo negro,

sobre las piedras de la costa:

un millón de gotas de mar

abiertas encima del agua:

clavado a la sal de las rocas

de tanto verde y fuego y furia,
de los poderes reunidos
en el silbante litoral
él parecía la amenaza:
él era la cruz y la horca:
la noche clavada en la cruz, 
la agonía de las tinieblas:
pero de pronto huyó en el cielo,
voló como una flecha negra
y subió cíclico volando
con su traje de nieve negra,
con pausa de estrella o de nave.

And the crucified aviator,
did not blink on his cross: 
the wave swelled and gave birth:
the rock trembled as it emerged:
the foam whispered softly
and there like a dark man hanging,
the cormorant remains dead,
the cormorant remains alive,
the cormorant remains alive and dead and cross
with the rigid black wings,
opened above the water: 
remains like a cruel hook
latched to the salt of the rocks,

and despite so much life and fire and fury,
despite the reunited powers,

He seemed threatening;
He was the cross and the noose,
the night nailed to the cross,
the agony of darkness, 
but suddenly he fled to the sky, 
flew like a black arrow,
spiralled upwards,
with his suit of black snow, 
with the pause of stars or ships.

tracing his pure equation in space.","<p>“Cormorán” was published in Neruda's book <em>Arte de pájaros</em> (<em>Bird’s Art</em>).

Feigning innocence

Finding itself firmly framed
Watching yourself wither petal by petal
No way out, no way to escape

Even if you leapt over walls
There are days blocking you from behind
That you cannont leap over

Women don't need philosophy
Women can wave off moonmarks
Just as dogs wave off water

Shut the weight of the drapes  
Misty tongue of morning licks the window glass

Return to the valley of the pillow
Like loose film, negatives exposed

The walnut tree beneath the window shivers
As if touched by a hand of ice

Her poems gained popularity in the 1980s, and around that time, she co-authored a collection of poetry with Gu Cheng, another prominent Misty Poet.

Uno está a la orilla del mar
salándose los ojos.
No hay otro modo de estar.
Uno es el perro ciego ladrándole a la luna
entre el garrote y la mofa.
No hay otro modo de ser.
Uno grita hasta reventarse el cuerpo,
y no hay sostén posible,
ni cielo para creer,
ni luz para beber,
sólo este oscuro destino de isla sorda
donde la sal relame los bordes de su orilla.

No sé qué orden de vientos ancestrales
te arroja en tu hora de primavera plena
a la embestida cáustica del mundo.
No hay palabra que alcance a decir
mi dolor de cuerpo incinerado,
retina de mis ojos,
proporción de mis días,
viento empujando mi maltrecha barca.
Todo gira en el aire,
todo cae en pedazos.
¿Cómo afrontar, sin lágrimas,
tu entrada al vértigo terrestre:
esta escala donde la eternidad ha tejido una urdimbre
de amor e inteligencia en pugna interminable
con un inmenso volumen de basura?

3
Tengo que decir
- Bueno..•
Y cruzarme de brazos,
sentada bajo el dintel de mi mundo boscoso,
mientras la miopía de un topo
se estrella contra el dedo gordo de mi pie,
y asciende la pendiente
un zorro con aire despistado.
Tendo que decir
- B u e n o . . .
Y una jauría me destaza.
Tengo que decir
- B u e n o . . .
Y una paloma gime con las alas quebradas.
Lo que duele en los nuestros
es como si la sangre toda de golpe se astillara;
y uno mira impotente, de rodillas,
como arrastra el tiempo en su corriente
lo que fue, lo que es, razón de nuestra vida.
Si, tengo que decir
—Bueno...
Mientras desata una tormenta
sus látigos oscuros
desde el fondo de mis ojos de luto.

4
Hemos velado juntas, en silencio,
nuestro propio cadáver,
guardando las palabras
para que no hicieran estallar
el cristal de la estancia en que se ha encerrado
para crecer el dolor.
En vano intentamos incorporarnos,
hallar el paso seguro.
Nos deshacemos como fantasmas
en un circulo de espuma.

5
Mi hija y yo comimos
la yerba amarga y el pan ácimo,
mientras pasaba afuera ululando la muerte.
Arracimadas en una sola lágrima,
oramos en minutos la equivalencia a meses,
días, años...
Y paso el pavor de la noche, temblando, sin tocamos.

6
Desde lejos,
la sangre que creíamos perdida
atraviesa la línea del tiempo como una cuchillada
y te rescata de mis arañas del miedo
y de tu miedo.

7
Vamos a guardar este segundo
en que te abates
hecha un nudo pequeño y lloroso
en el puño de mi mano.
A jugar a que puedes regresar un día;
a que no hay horizontes inciertos
que te estiren de mí.
Vamos a jugar a la mascarita sonriente,
mascarita de barro,
jrechingada máscara del diario
con que oculto
estas grietas de fuete
que es la vida en mi cara!

8
Decidida,
echas reversa en el tiempo
y te sumerges en las llamas bautismales,
antes de partir,
para no olvidar esta raíz que dejas
y que ardera sin tregua
como una lengua de fuego
siguiéndote a través de todos los caminos.

9
Este mes, o este resto de vida
será un andador pardo
de alfileres, de horror y de tortura.
Un largo grito de espanto
en que me lamerá el corazón
la lengua de una pesadilla.

10
Mansamente, sin quejas,
me siguió mi hija en el exilio,
aunque yo trastabillaba ciega
y era un signo casi desdibujado
en el gran pizarrón.
Ahora estoy aquí, traficando con palabras y lágrimas,
porque no quiero que desaloje de su corazón mi sitio,
ni me estrangule con el cable de un prematuro adiós.

11
Ella no volvió nunca.
Me senté en la puerta de mi locura a esperarla,
desde los siglos del vientre, sin dormir.
Ella no volvió nunca.
Un hachazo me parte a lo largo
de la cabeza a los pies.
Evadida de todo lo existente,
pacientemente tejí de su corazón al mío
un puente donde la luz hallaba entendimiento.
Hoy se me espesa la niebla en las pupilas,
envejezco limpiando, en la memoria, los minutos.
Ella no volvió nunca...
su dulzura de pájaro trémulo
echo raíz de amor,
en la grieta azul de Poitiers;
en una casa de campo,
entre rosedales, en el valle del Loire.
Allá la larva se tornó mariposa;
dicen que vino y me tocó en el hombro
con la magia de una alegría madura,
pero la niña que partió
con su vestido infantil de cristal asustado,
no volvió nunca.
Y yo me quedé en la puerta de mi locura,
en silencio,
a esperarla desde los siglos de mi vientre.

12
Todo lo que yo amé
me fue arrancado,
aspirado por el tragasol de la distancia.
Impotente,
ahumada en soledad,
desagotándome de amor,
me miro en esta tarde
que se deslíe sumisa
al resbalar en los cristales.

13
Consumida por un interno fuego,
hipocondriaca,
me esta comiendo el dolor
tejido tras tejido.

14
Desmembrada...
La mitad de mi cuerpo desasida,
navega hermética, lejana,
alcanza cada vez más distantes riberas.
Una anemia galopante hostiga mi alma.
Una invasión de amor se derrama en la sangre,
azota mi entereza.
Me sacan de los pies el mundo.
No volveré a ser, no volveré a estar, nunca,
sobre la tierra, junta.

15
Echado
bajo la mesa
mi cariño incorruptible,
espera el minuto en que al azar
pueda caerle un palabra.

16
No tocaré a otras puertas,
no clamaré a las gentes de otra orilla,
no pediré limosna en el umbral de mi miseria.
Voy a morirme aquí, como las bestias, en su madriguera,
en la oscuridad de mi guarida.","1.
You were at the edge of the sea
with salt in your eyes.
You had no other way of being.
You were a blind dog barking at the moon,
between drowning and pretending
you had no other way to be.
Your howl ruptured the body.
No props were possible, no heavens
believable, there was no light there
for you to drink. Only that dark island,
and you going deaf, and the salt
licking the edges of the shore.

II.
Not the ancestral wind, throwing
you into a fullness like spring,
not the avid violations of our world,
no word spoke the ache of the body,
cremated already, a retinue of eyes,
proportioned, day after day.
The wind battered the boat, but it's just
air. Does everything fall apart
like sadness on a face? You entered
a vertigo land — place where intelligence
and love are always winding, where
the web catches, more than anything, rubble.

III.
I say, good and fold my arms.
I sit in the door of my world,
forested, blind as a mole, while,
around my feet crash the clueless
foxes, trying to climb the mountain.
I can only say good as the troop
tears me to pieces. I have to say
good as if a dove with broken wings,
groaning. What hurts in me—
it's as if my blood were suddenly splintered.
Look—I am useless, I'm on my knees.
What was, what is, it all drags on
like a current. What reason could there
possibly be? Even if I say good,
the storm unleashes, the dark whips me,
and from the bottom of my eyes I am crying.

IV.
We were looking, together, in silence,
at our own corpse,
guarding our words
so that they would not break
the glass box in which we were locked.
In order to know our pain,
we tried in vain to be corporeal,
to find safe passage.
We dismantled like ghosts
in a circle of sea foam.
My daughter and I ate the bitter herb
and unleavened bread while, outside,
death howled as it passed.
Crowded around our fear, we prayed
in that one moment the prayers
of many months, days, years.
And then the terrible night passed,
trembling, not touching us.

VI.
Far afield -
we thought
the bloodline was lost
until they came toward us like knives.
Then, you were rescued
from the spiders of my fear
and the spiders of yours.

VII.
Let's guard this moment
in which you were cast down,
were made into a small knot,
tearful in the palm of my hand.
Let's pretend you can get back
some day, or that no unsettled
horizons unfold in me.
Let's play the mask game,
smiling, our masks of clay
striking each other, our
daily masks, our occult-
we crack like whips.
What kind of life is this?

VIII.
You decided on a reversal -
thrown around by time, you
dove into the baptismal fire.
Before leaving, so as to not
forget this root you carry,
you let it burn unabated
like the language of fire,
which follows you now on
every path.

IX.
This month, or for the rest of this life,
I will go brown. Of pins, of horror
and torture. I will cry my long cry.
Of terror in the heart—it will lick me
like the language of a nightmare.

Х .
Meekly, without complaint,
I took my daughter into exile,
although I stumbled blind
and was a sign almost blurred
on the high slate.I'm here now
peddling words and tears —
I do not want you to leave me —
your heart, my site — or strangle me
with the shackle of a premature goodbye—

XI.
She never returned.
It was madness to wait for her,
but I sat in the door
for ages, sleepless - she never
returned. An ax split
through me, head to toe. Existing
evaded me. The tissue
of your heart, of mine: a bridge
where the light was
understanding. Today, the fog
thickened in my eyes.
I cleaned and grew older. In memory,
in moments, she never
returns — her tremulous sweetness
like a bird, her love taking
root. In the blue crack of Poitiers,
in a house in the country,
among the rose gardens of the Loire,
beyond the larva turning
into a butterfly — say she came
and tapped me on the shoulder
with her magic, say she
were mature, happy... But the girl
who left with her
infant dress on, dressed in glass
and fear, she never
returned. And I stay at the door
of my madness, silent,
waiting. In my womb, centuries pass.

XII.
I love everything
that has torn me,
drawn in by the sun, which abides distances.
Impotent, smoking in solitude, what I love
drained away from me.
I look into the afternoon -
it has dissolved, it is submissive.
It slipped, it has crystallized.

XIII.
Consumed
by an internal, hypochondriac
fire, my pain
is eating me,
tissue by
tissue.

XIV.
Dismembered -
half my body dessicated, hermetically wandering,
distant, reaching increasingly distant shores, an anemia
taking my soul hostage, galloping, as love invades,
pours into the blood, whips the whole of me (the world
sweeps me off my feet) —I will not be, I will not be,
ever, on earth, together.

XV.
My incorruptible love, lying under the table -
wait for the moment when, at random, a word will fall.

XVI.
I will touch no other doors,
plead with no one from other shores,
I will not ask for alms in the shade
of my misery. I will die here, like the beasts
in their burrows, in the darkness of my den.",,"<p>Enriqueta Ochoa was a Mexican poet, born near the middle of the country in Torreón.

Until we pick up the alcohol-soaked rag,
And wrap it around our lacerated tongue.
Because we can't help but try
That light bulb you made look
Mouthwatering.","<p>When asked to translate a poem for Professor Taije Silverman's class, ""The Translation of Poetry, the Poetry of Translation,"" I didn't consider the work of Osip Mandelstam (1891-1938), both because I was unfamiliar with Russian and because everyone else in the class seemed overexcited about his poetry. This changed as soon as I learned who Mandelstam was, and I can't even begin to truly understand what he risked to write his poetry. Though he was writing poetry in Russia during a time when being part of literary group was inherently dangerous, Mandelstam kept reading his poetry to his peers and was exiled multiple times until his death in a camp
for exiles.</p>
<p>His poem warns against the temptation of translation --the desire to claim someone else's work by translating it into your own tongue. In translating this poem, I wanted to capture my own personal justification for translating; my translation is a kind of response to Mandelstam's original poem. I believe that even if we, as translators, can't understand the intention or emotion behind a specific work, we can still make a beautiful translation by finding new intention and meaning in our own interpretations of the original. As long as we can convey those feelings--our own feelings--then the translation can be successful. My adaptation does, for the most part, follow the original, with slight changes to make it more conversational.</p>
<p>I titled my poem ""Another Tongue,"" but there is no title for the original. Mandelstam only spoke his poems, and when he died his wife wrote them down from memory. They had no titles. However, most other translations refer to this poem as ""To the Translator"" for ease.</p>","<p>Osip Mandelstam was born in Warsaw, Poland, Russian Empire, on January 14, 1891. His family moved to St. Petersburg soon after and he was educated at the prestigious Tenishev School, where Pushkin attended. He then studied at the Sorbonne in Paris, the University of Heidelburg, and the University of St. Petersburg, converting from Judaism to Methodism so that he could attend the latter. He was a founding member of the Poets Guild, with Gumilev, Akhmatova, and Gorodetsky, which created the Acmeist movement in Russian poetry. His poetry collections include <span lang= ""ru""><em>Каминь</em></span> (<em>Stone</em>, 1913), <em>Trista</em> (1922), <span lang= ""ru""><em>Вторая Книга</em></span> (<em>Second Book</em>, 1923), as well as essays, short prose, and literary criticism in <em>The Noise of Time</em> and <em>Feodosiya</em> (both 1925) and <em>The Egyptian Stamp</em> (1928). He also worked as a translator. In 1934 he was arrested for his poem, “Stalin Epigram,” and was sent to a transit camp in Vladivostok. Later, he was exiled with his wife, Nadezhda, to Cherdyn in the Northern Urals. Mandelstam was arrested a second time during Stalin’s Great Terror and was sent back to Vladivostok, where he died on December 27, 1938, of starvation.</p>","<p>Hector Roman is a junior majoring in English at the University of

In the abundance of absence, 
This world hums with rightness. 
Even in a slight second, you lavish me
With each of nirvana’s boons. 
Who have I welcomed
In this honeyed-bargain of anguish? 
Who are you in my heart? 

I don’t understand what far-away harmony
thunders my heart-strings,
But in surrendering the reality of my ego,
I have found a kind of opposite.  
Has sorrow-night already washed 
In the midday’s meeting-light?
Who are you in my heart? 

In what continues of darkness,
One idol of light refuses to flicker.
Fire stretches down its fingers today,
Burning my world divine.
And I hear a midnight sound 
In decay and in life. 
Who are you in my heart? 

How do mute joy and mute grief
Nestle jewels in the hollow of my throat? 
What love-like bangles do the prides of paradise 
Slide up life’s graceful wrists? 
What does carefree, childish creation 
Weave into the world’s drumming life-rhythm? 
Who are you in my heart?","<p>Mahadevi Varma's command of the Hindi language is unparalleled to this day, with many of her words drawn from the ancient language of Sanskrit. It’s no surprise then that translating her poetry proved to be a challenge. I consider myself bilingual in Hindi and English; my entire life has been a swirl of the two languages. However, translating Varma made me question myself a little bit. I had to decipher some of her words by using old Hindi dictionaries. Some of the phrases she used weren’t even in those dictionaries, so I had to go further, into Sanskrit vocabulary. Her sentence structure and diction astounded me, and through translating her poetry, I learned more about my mother tongue. Varma’s poetry reads like a song, and “Kaun tum mere hriday mein?” or “Who Are You in My Heart” is no different. The first four lines of each stanza rhyme, and then the penultimate and last lines of the stanza rhyme, with the last line always being “Kaun tum mere hriday mein?” The rhyme scheme was a mark of Varma’s genius, as rhyming in a language like Hindi is extremely difficult due to the lack of words that all have the same sound in the last syllable. I initially tried to preserve the rhyming in my translation, but in doing so, I lost the dreamlike melody of the song. I decided to stay true to the meaning of the poem rather than the rhyme scene. Another thing to note is that the inflection of the last line of each stanza, though the words are the same, is meant to change in each stanza. This is a common practice in Hindi poetry — having a refrain that repeats throughout the poem, with the inflection changing every time it is read. Though I could not translate this practice into English, I tried to give each stanza of my translation a different emotional pulse, so that when the reader got to “Who are you in my heart?” it would very naturally emote the way the rest of the stanza did, be it a despairing cry or a relieved sigh.</p>","<p>Mahadevi Varma (<span lang=""hi"">महादेवी वर्मा</span>) was one of the Chhayavad poets of India, the equivalent of the Western Romantics, so to speak.</p> ","<p>Shailly Pandey is a sophomore studying Biological Basis of Behavior and pre-medicine at the College of Arts and Science at the University of Pennsylvania.

genesis16-1-6,Genesis 16: 1–6,Genesis 16: 1–6,Martin Luther,Michaela Kotziers,"Sarai, Abrams Weib, gebar ihm kein Kind. Sie hatte eine ägyptische Magd, die hieß Hagar. 

Und sie sprach zu Abram: Siehe, der HERR hat mich verschlossen, daß ich nicht gebären kann. Gehe doch zu meiner Magd, ob ich vielleicht aus ihr mich aufbauen möge. Und Abram gehorchte der Stimme Sarais. 

Da nahm Sarai, Abrams Weib, ihre ägyptische Magd, Hagar, und gab sie Abram, ihrem Mann, zum Weibe, nachdem sie zehn Jahre im Lande Kanaan gewohnt hatten. 

Und er ging zu Hagar, die ward schwanger. Als sie nun sah, daß sie schwanger war, achtete sie ihre Frau gering gegen sich.

Da sprach Sarai zu Abram: Du tust unrecht an mir. Ich habe meine Magd dir in die Arme gegeben; nun sie aber sieht, daß sie schwanger geworden ist, muß ich gering sein in ihren Augen. 
Der HERR sei Richter zwischen mir und dir. 

Abram aber sprach zu Sarai: Siehe, deine Magd ist unter deiner Gewalt; tue mit ihr, wie dir's gefällt. Da sie nun Sarai wollte demütigen, floh sie von ihr. 

","I was Sarai, wife of Abram. 
He was Abram, husband of Sarai.

I said: Take Hagar.
Spill your seed unto her bowels and plant 
you there a tree. Plant a tree that if not 
thee and I and thy seed, 
then at least thee and I can climb, 
climb its branches lumbering towards
an opalescent sky.

I brought Hagar, my Egyptian maid. 
Hagar I brought unto you. 

I brought her to you in the night 
and stood outside your tent 
numbering stars against 
soft murmurs melting 
like sand to glass beneath my tongue. 

Hagar said she was pregnant,
with child by you, 
by you and your child.
Her soft belly swelled 
with youth and with seed
and with pride and with child.

I said: You abuse me.

I gave you Hagar, my Egyptian maid.
Hagar I brought to you, 
and from her you drew 
like a well. 
She sees my lips are tied to my womb, 
that you are tied to your seed as I am to you,
but the knots are coming loose, 
unraveling now numberless 
like the dust the Lord said would be 
our seed.

You said <em>aber</em> to me: Hagar is your maid, 
your servant, your wish. 
You said: Sarah, Hagar is beneath you.

I said: Do not call me Sarah 
when our names are not yet changed,
when we are not yet old, 
when my stomach aches in empty folds 
by God’s judgment. 

My being is moved for your son, 
for our son whose name we know. 

For your son I dream 
but do not speak.

I said: Hagar must leave from you and me.","<p>My adaptation hones in on Sarai’s point of view — what it meant for a woman to be barren in Biblical times and the maternal despair felt at this point in her story, before the angels have prophesied that she will bear Abram a son. I found it interesting that Abram, who this entire story depends upon (without the need to spread Abram’s seed, Hagar would not have been used as a handmaid), had only one line of speech in the Biblical version. As the root cause of Sarai’s struggle, I decided to make his figure more present throughout the poem with Sarai’s dialogue. My translation oscillates between a narrative and direct address from Sarai to Abram in order to produce a dissonance between what distresses Sarai and what she reveals to Abram.</p>
<p>Words such as “bowels,” “skies,” “dust,” and “seed,” along with archaic pronouns, evoke both the original passage and other Biblical stories. <em>Aber</em> was kept from the German original; there is no clean English translation for the word, and the intensity that it creates in the German seemed too important to omit from Abram’s line.</p>","<p>Martin Luther (1483-1546) led the Protestant Reformation, breaking from the Roman Catholic Church for its indulgences and abuse of papal authority.

紧紧捂住了自己的眼睛
当人们四散离去，谁
还站在船尾

Among the multicolored handkerchiefs that set you free
Whose is the hand that retracts itself
Creating cover
For her own eyes?
When all drift away
Who remains
Tied to the mast?
Cresting clouds restlessly flow through every dress fold
Like the tides of the river, wanting:
Above
Below
Calling for a lovely dream and beautiful sorrow left
Behind
Passing through time, along the lines of the earth
To paradise
But can a heart truly harden when it beat so ardently?
For a chance to gaze at ghosts: silent in the immortal sky,
You would give all the moons of fertile springs;
Along the shore, floods of flowers whisper
Inciting new betrayal.
Spending your future
A cliff-top show piece,
Is hollow compared to
Weeping on your lover's shoulder,
Tonight.

<h2>translated by Madeline Penn</h2>

Handkerchiefs
Fluttering with crimson threads, glowing golden-rose
Whose fingers fell away
Whose eyelids dipped
When all had gone, who lingers on the keel?
Sky-pillows float, tides tumble,
Rolling along the sand
Mystical dream stripped of mystical sorrow
Earth to ether, everlasting
But does heart harden to rock?
To catch sight of cranes in the unbounded blue
You've sacrificed many Springmoons
By the tumbling tide
By the rush of royal oak and willow,
Trust is tarnished like stained ivory silk.
Over mountain-lingering for millennia,
You wept in the crevice of your lover's shoulder

<h2>translated by Alex Stern</h2>

Whose hand suddenly withdrew
from the crowd of waving handkerchiefs
to cover her eyes?
Who remained at the stern
while everyone left,
clouds cresting through the folds of her dress?
The river tides:
a yearning high,
a yearning low,
a beautiful dream leaving behind a beautiful sorrow.
It stays —from world to heaven,
heaven to world.
But can a heart phase into stone?
Would it,
for a chance to gaze
at quiet, distant cranes?
Countless full moons
have missed us from the springtide.
The choice is this:
Millennia marking a cliff
Or a single night to weep, and a shoulder waiting.

<h2>translated by Hector Roman</h2>

While brightly colored handkerchiefs wave at you
one hand withdraws
shielding her eyes.
When those handkerchiefs had flown away, one
remained pensive at the stern
her flowing dress mirroring the restless clouds' flight
The sounds of the river's tides
Hopeful, high
Longing, low
that lovely dream imparts lasting sorrow
through generations, from finite earth to the inestimable heavens.
But can any warm heart
be fully petrified?
You sacrificed the fluorescence of countless full moons
for a chance to contemplate close-mouthed cranes
but, along the river's shore
the infinite privet and gush of goldenglow
begin talks of treachery
for who could choose a millennia on a mountain
over one night's comfort-crying
on the shoulder of a tangible dream?

<h/2>translated by Keija Wang</h2>

Among al the colored handkerchiefs that waved at you
Whose was the hand that abruptly withdrew
Tightly covering her own eyes?
When everyone had scattered to leave, who
Remained standing at the stern
Cresting clouds flying through every dress fold?
The river's tides...
A yearning high
A yearning low
A beautiful dream leaves behind a beautiful sorrow
Retold generation after generation, from this world to heaven's hold
But, can a heart
Truly turn into stone...?
For a chance to gaze at the soundless cranes in the distant sky
You've passed up countless full moons on the springtide.
Take a walk by the river shore;
The undercurrents of your privets and goldenglow
Are inciting a new betrayal
Instead of spending entire millennia exhibited on a cliff
Why not find solace on the shoulders of a loved one true?

<h2>translated by Malika Kadyrova</h2>

Among the multi-coloured handkerchiefs waving
whose hand suddenly drew back
to tightly cover her eyes
When everyone had scattered and left
who still remained at the stern
clouds roaming through every fold of her dres
The cresting waves of the river
A yearning high, a yearning low
What lingers after an exquisite dream
generation through generation
From this world to heaven's hold
can a heart turn to stone?
For the chance to look up at the silent cranes 
in the so many full-mooned springtides were mislaid
Each flood of privet and goldenglow
is a new betrayal
Better to spend the night crying on a lover's shoulder
than to stand on this cliff
on display for a thousand years

<h2>translated by Macile Dietrick</h2>

For you they'll wave banners, rainbows
of handkerchiefs, but whose hand
will hold back, clasping tight
over eyes.
When they've scattered like prism light, who
will guide the stern through the clouds,
cresting in the folds of a dress
and the river, its tides
yearning high,
yearning low.
Beautiful dreams sow a beautiful sorrow
generations deep, as heaven
holds the world,
but a heart
never really turns to stone.
Oh, how many moons will you miss
full with spring
for gazing at the shadows of crane wings,
while along the shore a cascade of brush
and daisies give rise
to secret undoings.
Don't stand so firm at the cliffside -
what if one night your tears
shone here, on love's shoulder.

<h2>translated by Anna Carapellotti</h2>

Of the bright, silk scarves waving at you
Mine was the hand that suddenly withdrew

Palms pressed over my eyes
Everyone scattered, without goodbyes

I remain at the edge of the stern
The breeze ruffles my skirt, the clouds restlessly churn

River tides run high, then low
Beautiful dreams forsaken make room for sorrow

From generation to generation, from Earth to Heaven's hold
Cranes soar skyward with mute beaks of gold

You've passed countless full moons on the springtide
Privet and goldenglow along for the ride

Now a new betrayal rolls in the crest
But is there shame in moaning one night on your lover's chest?

Instead you'll spend forever on the peak alone
But I wonder, can a heart truly harden into stone?

<h2>translated by Steph Barron</h2>

They waved at you, those coloured handkerchiefs
But whose hand suddenly withdrew
To cover her eyes
As everyone dispersed?
Who remained at the stern?
Who crested restless clouds
Through river tides, yearning
High
And low?
A beautiful dream will leave you
Suspended over a jagged cliff
With a legacy
Of beautiful sorrow,
From this world to the embrace of heaven.
But can a heart
Become stone, truly?
You've passed numerous moons on the springtide
To gaze skyward to silent cranes
The currents of the river valley
Sing of a new betrayal.

<h2>translated by Michael Karam</h2>

Among the multicolored handkerchiefs
That waved at me
A hand suddenly withdrew
Tightly hiding my own eyes.
When everyone else had fled, who
Remained behind,
Standing by me at the stern
Cutting through the clouds,
Courageously flying
Through every dress fold.
The river tides,
A yearning ebbing,
A yearning flowing,
Beautiful dream
Leaving behind beautiful sorrow
Fleeing through the generations,
From this earth to heaven's hold
But can my heart
Truly turn to stone?
For a chance to gaze
At the voiceless cranes
In a muted sky
I've given up countless full moons
On the springtide.
Along the river bend
The rushing currents of the willow and silver birch
Incite a new betrayal.
Instead of spending forever being showcased on a cliff
Why not, on a lover's shoulder, sob a full night true?

<h2>translated by Shailly Pandey</h2>

In the iridescent handkerchiefs that wave to you
Whose hand is suddenly withdrawn
Tightly concealing her eyes
When the others take their leave, who
Is still perched at the stern
The folds of a dress rippling with crested clouds
And tides of rivers
Lamenting high
Lamenting low
Beautiful dreams leave beautiful melancholy
In one eternity and the next,
But can the heart
Really become stone
To gaze up at the prayers of cranes in the sky
You've sacrificed countless Spring moons
O n the river bank
Torrents of privet and goldenglow
Ignite infidelities below you
You:
On a cliff for one thousand years
Is never like
The joy of stifling sobs
Into love's curving shoulders
For a night whispering with stars.

<h2>translated by Naomi Bernstein</h2>

Among the multicolored handkerchiefs
One waves at you
The one whose hand drew away
As you looked, covering eyes
After everyone was gone, the one who
Stayed
Standing at the stern despite currents
Of your terrible yesterdays
Clouds transforming as the creases of silk
Walk through wind
The river flow
The wanting high
The wanting low
Waking up to that lovely sadness after a lovely dream
Passing through life
Over again
But can a heart turn to stone
For the chance to just
Watch
Now you've turned away too many
Now the river won't return
Instead of taping that photo of you
To the moon
Why not cry in the arms of someone
You can touch
Who can touch — you?

<h2>translated by Kristen Pearson</h2>

From among the multicolored handkerchiefs they waved at you,
the hand that suddenly withdrew
to cover grieving eyes
was mine,
and it was I who lingered at the stern when all the others scattered,
eager to gape at fresher marvels.
The clouds cresting off the water tangled in the hem of my skirt,
and I felt the river's yearning in the tides.

A beautiful dream leaves behind a beautiful sorrow.
It echoes in heaven and earth; it endures.
But can a heart really turn to stone?

For the chance to gaze upon the distant cranes,
their laughter silenced in the upper air,
you've given up the sight of springtime moonlight.
Remember how it shivered on the river bank,
and kissed the inlet eddies choked with petals
From the privet and the goldenglow?

Break your promise.
Better to sob a single night on a new lover's shoulder
than to make yourself into a shrine of stone.","<p>These renditions were created by students in a seminar on poetry and translation, using numerous published versions of the poem and guided by native speakers in the class, particularly Keija Wang.</p>","<p>Shu Ting (舒婷) is from Fujian, China.
