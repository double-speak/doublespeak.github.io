","and I have seen the tears of the oppressed 
dissolving drop by drop on their cheeks —
and the scent of chrysanthemums 
rose fresh from the valleys
with the fragrance of acacia, opening, awake
and seas of streams shattered
 themselves upon rocks
in a wave born from unrooted joy —  
and on the shore of the Galilee 
there were bathers 
and no spirit blew across the sea
and nobody walked upon the waves,
only a tumult of boats, scouting and playing.

and I will have seen the tears of the oppressor – 
if you wish for a piece of Light, the light
is your own.
and each shall be free as a crane
to go and to come,
apart from the one
who’s my own.
and it is good for eyes to behold the light
and the stream of the sea is so warm and sweet 
and the tears of oppression so bitter.","<p>“all Your breakers and Your waves” was originally written in Hebrew by Dahlia Ravikovitch, an Israeli poet and peace activist born in 1936. At the time that Ravikovitch wrote, much of Israeli poetry was written in a mix of Biblical and Modern Hebrew, which meant that although I know no Modern Hebrew, the amount of Biblical Hebrew I’ve learned in the past two years gave me strong basis for understanding the poem.</p>
<p>In my translation, I chose to lift up ambiguities created by considering this text from the viewpoint of Biblical, rather than Modern Hebrew. The first is an ambiguity behind the word <span lang=""he"">העשוקים</span>, which in Modern Hebrew translates more directly to “the oppressed,” but in Biblical Hebrew can also simply mean “oppression.” At around the time I first read this poem, I began working with an activist organization in which we talked about how oppression works as a cycle in which oppressors dehumanize the oppressed and, in doing so, become dehumanized themselves, while those who have experienced oppression may more easily become oppressors. With this cycle in mind, I chose to translate this word differently each of the three times it appears in this poem — first as oppressed, then as oppressor, and lastly as oppression. As long as oppression exists, no one on any point of the spectrum can be fully human.  The other ambiguity centered around the tense of the verb in the first line of each stanza. In Biblical Hebrew, but not Modern Hebrew, verbs that begin with the prefix “and” oddly switch tense from past to future or vice-versa. This poem is written in the past tense, but because the two lines in question begin with “and,” to a reader of Biblical Hebrew, the tense would seem to be future. I chose to use both tenses, pairing the future, which to me communicates a prophetic yearning, with the translation of <span lang=""he"">העשוקים</span> as “oppressor” because although we may recognize and mourn oppression thousands of times across history, what will bring us true redemption will be reckoning with the oppressor and rehumanizing both sides.</p>","<p>Dahlia Ravikovitch (<span lang=""he"">דליה רביקוביץ</span>)was born in Ramat Gan, Israel, in 1936 and died in Tel Aviv, in 2005. She is one of the most well-known contemporary Israeli poets, peace activists, and translators, her primary language being Hebrew. Losing her father at an early age, she spent time in a <em>kibbutz</em> and then at several foster homes. She published her first book of poetry in 1959, called <em>The Love of an Orange</em>. Throughout her lifetime, she published ten volumes of poetry, which was translated into twenty-three languages. She has also translated the works of W.B. Yeats, T.S. Eliot, and Edgar Allan Poe into Hebrew. Many of her poems have been set to song and are well-known radio favorites in Israel.</p>

At age nineteen, she alarmed surrounding passengers on a plane when she cried for an hour after reading that Millay died at the end of her biography (not a surprise ending). Mira entered the wild and contentious world of translation through Professor Taije Silverman's Translation of Poetry course, which was the best gateway she could have hoped for.</p>",Hebrew,he,../assets/images/images_16/ravikovitch.jpg,,photo by Shailly Pandey,,,,2016,submission

An interesting moment for me was in grappling with Rouzeau’s bells that could “sonner au cou de la vie vache.”  I had initially seen the bells as ringing “until the cows come home,” although that didn’t fully encompass the misery of <em>la vie vache</em>, which then became “a dog’s life.”</p>
<p><em>Va où</em> is a sprawling collection, and I am slowly translating and retranslating my way through it. I find that the poems hit me at a different angle every time and I find myself grasping them at different ends, which accounts for my sense of the <em>maintenant</em> in “encore maintenant toujours” as being closer – for me – to “holding” than “now.”</p>","<p>Valérie Rouzeau (1967–) is a French poet and translator.

In addition to deciding not to capitalize lines or add in more punctuation, I also kept the occasional extra spaces in the original, which I felt created more natural pauses without disrupting the flow of the poem. I wanted to capture the quiet desperation beneath her religious language and gorgeous imagery without veering into melodrama.

at the place where you promised to be,

every step that approaches

strums my heart.

Even a rustling leaf steps toward me.

Anyone who has waited for someone knows

that there is nothing in this world that makes one’s heart ache as much.

Every person who opens the door and walks in,

into the place where you promised, where I arrived early,

was you,

probably you, perhaps you,

then the door closes again.

My beloved,

as I wait for you who do not come,

I come toward you at last.

I come toward you from a very far place,

and now you come toward me, as you have for a very long time.

As you approach from far away, slowly even at this very moment,

I come closer to you as I wait for you.

Through the door that others opened,

tracing every step that strums my heart,

I come closer to you as I wait for you.

Although he forgot about writing the poem, it became one of his best-known works after being recited on a radio show. The poet himself was ashamed of the poem for a while because of its “cheesiness,” but many readers could certainly relate to the excitement and frustration of waiting for someone or something dearly, and saw themselves in his writing.

and even if these nights should pass
and I have you
and don’t.","<p>Translating “Corazón coraza” was like coming up against the first experience of a feeling that I have sought and reveled in many times hence. It was one of the first poems I ever recall reading, probably the first one I took seriously. I remember feeling it was a very inviting read, since not only does it take, in my opinion, a very positive stand on its subject matter, but more importantly, it features a great example of Benedetti’s trademark simplicity and wordplay, which my thirteen-or-so-years-old self must have thought both invitingly clever and useful to canalize my feelings (I’m sure Benedetti was also a romantic at thirteen).</p>
<p>Benedetti writes in layers, small thoughts and images always in dialogue, usually in one direction, one with the next. The bridge of communication between these layers is where the main idea nurtures and develops. At the end of the poem, you get a feeling that the message is like a staircase of bridges, invisible climbing (or descending) steps found between each visible line. He may start from the outside and make his way in, or he may start with the source and finish almost as a spectator to his own craft. To offer just one example of this in “Corazón coraza,” we may note how he sets his tone with the first lines “porque te tengo y no / porque te pienso” (“because I have you and don’t / because I feel you”), and then, like layers, he uses a simple image to add depth in the succeeding lines: “porque la noche está de ojos abiertos / porque la noche pasa y digo amor” (literal translation: “because night is open-eyed / because night passes and I say love”). Clearly, a literal translation doesn’t fully evoke the original image, especially because “love” and <em>amor</em> have a <em>OneHundred Years of Solitude</em>–worthy gap of history and meaning between them, to say the least, as far as Benedetti is concerned. It certainly felt incomplete, but it wasn’t until I had finished translating everything that I was able to notice this. My point here is that it was very hard for me to write the translation the way that Benedetti wrote the original (with the one-directional layers and the overall metaphor that builds in between), so instead, I chose to make it more explicit, such as “because the night draws breath and I exhale you,” which is an idea you only fully acquire in the original when you get to the very end of the poem, “y aunque / la noche pase y yo te tenga / y no,” and are able to fully comprehend the metaphorical and sensorial meanings of “night” as Benedetti intended them.</p>
<p>On a last note, probably one of the most difficult parts of the process was coming up with a decent title. <em>Coraza</em> is very loose to translate, and is just a very transmutable and widely metaphorized word in Spanish. It also sounds very un-poetic in English. Some very poor examples I went through: “heart-cuirass, “Heart-bark,” “Heart-armor,” “Paper-heart” (I was desperate at this point), and a couple more not even worth mentioning. Then the ingenious Emma Hirvisalo came up with “Rind-heart,” (Rind! Amazing!), which I modified to “Heart-rind” to adjust for rhythm. I can’t even describe the perfect puzzle-fit giddiness I felt at that point. So thanks again, Emma, wherever you currently find yourself in your perfect eureka word pitch translation crusade.</p>
<p>[<em>Editor’s Note: Emma was a Finnish exchange student at the University of Pennsylvania. She and Rafa took a translation course together.</em>]</p>","<p>Mario Benedetti (1920–2009) was an Uruguayan writer who belonged to the “Generación del 45” (Generation of ’45), known for its close ties to political rife and rising modernist ideas and innovative writing structures. He was a city poet, and his love and concern for Montevideo is found all throughout the colloquial-style dialogues he crafted and recreated in both his novels and his poems. His pen is subtle and simple, and in many ways he is almost the perfect supporting actor to the themes and personas he wrote about or fictionalized, a quality that perhaps stemmed from his equally passive manner of approaching arguably volatile themes such as political protest, social injustice, and repressed love. He is not very well-known in the English-speaking world, an observation that begs further inquiry as it is inversely proportional to his influence in Latin America with respect to other Hispanic poets that have been much more widely translated. His last poem, which he dictated to his secretary in his deathbed, might evoke a similar idea:</p>

a tus ojos oceánicos. 
 
Allí se estira y arde en la más alta hoguera
mi soledad que da vueltas los brazos como un náufrago 
 
Hago rojas señales sobre tus ojos ausentes
que olean como el mar a la orilla de un faro. 
 
Sólo guardas tinieblas, hembra distante y mía, 
de tu mirada emerge a veces la costa del espanto. 
 
Inclinado a las tardes echo mis tristes redes 
a ese mar que sacude tus ojos oceánicos.

to your eyes, they are oceans. 
 
There the nets stretch and flare in a tall fire,
my loneliness thrashes with arms like a man drowning.
 
I send red signals toward your absent eyes
that drift like the sea to the shore of the lighthouse.
 
But you guard only darkness, distant girl of mine,
and from your gaze rises a shore of fear sometimes.
 
Leaning into the afternoons I toss my weary nets
to this sea that shakes your eyes, they are oceans.
 
The nocturnal birds peck the first stars
that shine like my soul when I love you.
 
The night gallops on its mare of shadow
scattering blue wheat over the field.","<p>After immersing myself in Pablo Neruda’s <em>Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair</em>, my outlook on the state of modern love became exceedingly cynical. Neruda was twenty years old when he wrote his book of love poems, and in it he demonstrates a respect and passion for women that most contemporary men won’t reach in a lifetime. I translated Neruda to combat “locker room banter” and the harmful rhetoric toward women that has been normalized in our society.</p>
<p>My goal was to maintain a level of fluidity here that will inevitably fail in comparison to Neruda’s rhythm. Spanish can roll in a way that English doesn’t, but it was essential to me that the language I chose be as smooth as a net tossed over the ocean. This was especially difficult because part of the smoothness of Spanish comes from the order in which sentences are arranged; it’s vastly different from English syntax. I’m proud of the way this translation reads within the confines of the English language.</p>","<p>Pablo Neruda was an internationally renowned Chilean poet and politician. He was born in 1904 in Parral, Chile, and he wrote in his native Spanish. Especially prolific, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971. His strong commitment to the Communist Party had significant influence on his poetry, though he wrote about a variety of subjects, from ordinary human existence and love to world events. His style drew on surrealism, political manifestos, and historical epics.

atıldığımız çöplükte bile zerrelerimiz 
yan yana düşecek. 
Toprağa beraber dalacağız.

daha ölümü düşünmüyorum. 
Ben daha bir çocuk doğuracağım. 
Hayat taşıyor içimden. 
Kaynıyor kanım. 
Yaşayacağım, ama çok, pek çok, 
ama sen de beraber. 
Ama ölüm de korkutmuyor beni. 
Yalnız pek sevimsiz buluyorum 
bizim cenaze şeklini. 
Ben ölünceye kadar da 
bu düzelir herhalde. 
Hapisten çıkmak ihtimalin var mı bu günlerde?

belki diyor. 

18 Şubat 1945","I
would like to die before you.
Do you suppose the one who comes
behind will find the one who goes? 
I don’t suppose so. 
Better, you’ll have me burned, 
you’ll put me on the stove in your kitchen
inside a pot. 
Let the pot be glass,
translucent, white glass
so you see me inside…
You see my sacrifice:
I’ve surrendered being earth,
I’ve surrendered being a flower
to stay beside you. 
And I’m disappearing into dust
I’m living beside you.
Then, when you die
you can come to my pot.
And we’ll live there together 
in my ashes your ashes,
until a careless bride
or an ungrateful grandchild 
throws us out…
But we
until then
will have so completely
mixed
into each other, 
that even in the dump we’re tossed in, 
our bits
will fall side by side. 
We’ll scatter into the soil together.
And if one day a wild flower 
moistens and buds through this soil
surely in its stem
two flowers will bloom:
You one,
I the other.
I don’t think of death yet.
I will give birth to a child. 
Life is overflowing from me.
I am full of life. 
I will live, but for a long time, very long,
but you will also live with me. 
But death doesn’t scare me either. 
Though I find the manner of our funeral
quite unpleasant.
And until I die,
this will change I suppose. 
Is there a chance you’ll get out of prison 
one of these days?
Something inside me
says maybe.

February 18, 1945","<p>Nâzım Hikmet has a special place in my heart that I hadn’t realized before. I was reintroduced to his poetry last spring through a translation class. I had never considered how strange it is to translate from your mother tongue, how cautious and intimate the experience is. There are definitely things that I find untranslatable, especially between Turkish and English, and Hikmet has a peculiar language of his own that I have not quite figured out how to define. It’s hard to let go of words that, to me, mean so much, and having to find those words in English can feel impossible from time to time. In “I Would Like to Die Before You,” I wanted to get through the sensation of a daydream; how images can seem so real in your head yet they also feel so unattainable. It’s tough to stay loyal to the original as you can say things in Turkish with so little words sometimes, but in English things multiply. I love the part about the translucent pot on the stove, and I hope I was able to bring that image a little closer. In the end everything still seems untranslatable, but I think the in-between created through translation has a life of its own, and is constantly moving and changing.</p>","<p>Nâzım Hikmet (1902–1963) was a Turkish poet, playwright, and revolutionary figure. His political views and support for communism often landed him in jail, where he wrote much of his poetry. His poetry was looked to by much of Turkey’s youth as the poetry of the revolution. He is considered Turkey’s first modern poet and was influenced by the Russian Futurist movement. After being released from jail after starting a hunger strike, Hikmet moved to the Soviet Union.</p>","<p>Keyla Çavdar is a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying English and fine arts. She was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey, and moved to Philadelphia in 2014. She was reintroduced to revolutionary Turkish poet Nâzım Hikmet in Taije Silverman’s translation class in the spring of 2016; Hikmet’s poetry made it possible for her to understand not only the current political climate in Turkey, but also the implications of losing one’s country and language. Translation enabled her to dwell in the space between her mother tongue, Turkish, and her second language, English. Exploring the space between these languages brought about a consciousness of distance, which she writes about in <em>Notes on the Afterlives</em>.</p>",Turkish,tr,,,,,,,2016,submission
metaphysique-des-tubes,<em>Métaphysique des tubes</em>,Métaphysique des tubes,Amélie Nothomb,Kathleen Zhou,"<p>Un jour, ma mère arriva dans le salon 
avec un animal à long cou dont la queue mince 
et longue terminait dans une prise de courant. 
Elle poussa un bouton et la 
bête amorça une plainte régulière et ininterrompue. 
La tête se mit à bouger sur 
le sol en un mouvement de va-et-vient qui entraînait 
le bras de Maman derrière 
elle. Parfois le corps avançait sur 
ses pattes qui étaient des roulettes.</p>
<p>Ce n’était pas la première fois que 
je voyais un aspirateur mais je n’avais pas 
encore réfléchi à sa condition. 
Je m’approchai de lui 
à quatre pattes pour être à sa hauteur; 
je savais qu’il fallait toujours être 
à la hauteur de ce 
que l’on examinait. 
Je suivis sa tête et posai 
ma joue sur le tapis 
pour observer ce qui se passait. 
Il y avait un miracle: 
l’appareil avalait les réalités 
matérielles qu’il rencontrait 
et les transformait 
en inexistence.</p>
<p>Il remplaçait 
le quelque chose par le rien: 
cette substitution 
ne pouvait être qu’œuvre divine.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Sans plus attendre, 
j’ouvris la bouche et je scandai 
les quatre syllabes : « Aspirateur! »</p>
<p>Un instant interdite, 
ma mère lâcha le cou 
du tuyau et courut téléphoner à mon père :
<p class=""indent"">— Elle a dit son troisième mot !<br>
— C’est quoi ?<br>
— Aspirateur !<br>
— Bien. Nous en ferons 
une ménagère accomplie.</p>
<p>Il devait être un peu déçu.</p>
<p>J’avais fait très fort pour le troisième mot; 
je pouvais dès lors me permettre d’être 
moins existentielle pour le quatrième. 
Estimant que ma sœur, 
de deux ans et demi 
mon aînée, était une bonne personne, 
j’élus son prénom.</p>
<p class=""indent"">— Juliette ! clamai-je en 
la regardant dans les yeux.</p>
<p>Le langage a des pouvoirs immenses: 
à peine avais-je prononcé à haute voix ce 
nom que nous nous prîmes 
l’une pour l’autre d’une folle passion. 
Ma sœur me saisit 
entre ses bras et me serra. 
Tel le philtre d’amour de Tristan et Iseult, le mot 
nous avait unies pour toujours.</p>
<p>Il était hors de question que 
je choisisse pour cinquième vocable le prénom de 
mon frère, de quatre ans mon aîné: 
ce mauvais sujet avait passé un après-midi 
assis sur ma tête à lire un <em>Tintin</em>. 
Il adorait me persécuter. 
Pour le punir, je ne le nommerai pas. 
Ainsi il n’existerait pas tellement.</p>
<p>Vivait avec nous Nishio-san, 
ma gouvernante japonaise. 
Elle était la bonté même et me 
dorlotait pendant des heures. 
Elle ne parlait aucune autre langue 
que la sienne. 
Je comprenais tout ce qu’elle disait. 
Mon cinquième mot fut 
donc nippon puisque je la nommai.</p>
<p>J’avais déjà donné leur nom 
à quatre personnes : à chaque fois cela 
les rendait si heureuses 
que je ne doutais pas de l’importance de 
la parole : elle prouvait aux individus 
qu’ils étaient là. 
J’en conclus qu’ils n’en 
n’étaient pas sûrs. 
Ils avaient besoin de moi pour le savoir.</p>","<p>One day, my mother appeared in the living room 
alongside a long-necked animal 
with a slim and long tail 
ending in a power outlet. 
She pressed a button and the creature emitted 
a long and uninterrupted whine. 
Its head moved close to the ground, 
in a back-and-forth manner that 
dragged Mama’s arms behind her. 
Sometimes, its body advanced on its paws, 
which were small wheels.</p>
<p>It was not the first time that 
I had seen a vacuum cleaner, 
but I had not yet reflected on its condition. 
I approached it on all fours to 
be at its level; 
I knew you should always be at the same level 
as the subject being examined. 
I followed its head and rested my cheek on 
the carpet to observe what was happening. 
Then there was a miracle: 
the creature swallowed 
the material entities 
it encountered and made 
them nonexistent.</p>
<p>It was replacing something by nothing: 
this substitution could only 
be divine work.</p> <p>[…]</p>
<p>Without further ado, 
I opened my mouth and I chanted the four 
syllables: “Vacuum cleaner!”</p>
<p>Speechless, my mother dropped 
the hose’s neck and ran 
to telephone my father:</p>
<p class=""indent"">“She just said her third word!”<br>
“What is it?”<br>
“Vacuum cleaner!”<br>
“Good. We’ll make an accomplished 
housewife out of her.”</p>
<p>My father must’ve been a little disappointed.</p>
<p>I had surpassed myself for the third word; 
I therefore allowed myself to be 
less existential for the fourth. 
Deciding that my sister, 
two and-a-half-years my elder, 
was a good person, I elected to say her name.</p>
<p>“Juliette!” I clamored on seeing her in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>Language has immense powers: 
I had barely said her name aloud 
when we felt a crazy passion for one another. 
My sister seized me in her arms and hugged me tight. 
Like the love potion of Tristan and Iseult, 
the word had united us forever.</p>
<p>It was out of the question 
that I’d choose the name of my brother, 
four years my elder, 
as my fifth word: 
that nasty piece of work had passed one afternoon 
sitting on my head while reading a <em>Tintin</em>. 
He adored persecuting me. 
As punishment, I would not name him. 
And so he did not really exist.</p>
<p>Nishio-san, my Japanese nanny, lived with us. 
She was kindness itself and coddled me for hours. 
She did not speak any other language but her own. 
I understood everything she said. 
My fifth word was Japanese because I chose Nishio-san’s name.</p>
<p>I had already named four people. 
Every time it rendered them so happy that 
I never doubted the importance of speech: 
it proved to people that they existed. 
I concluded that they weren’t entirely sure of it. 
They needed me to tell them.</p>
","<p>I translated this snipped of Amélie Nothomb’s autobiographical novel <em>Métaphysique des tubes</em> for a French-to-English translation course I audited while abroad in Lyon, France. I remember this particular excerpt fondly for two reasons: a) as one of the first pieces I worked on, it required Google Translate every third word or so, which was a useful ego check, and b) Nothomb’s irreverent aside masks a deeper understanding of the power of language. Language is a crude tool to communicate indescribable meanings. To name something is to recognize it (and its existence), but also to depict a whole, complex system of emotions (kinship, love, disdain, etc). This excerpt captures both that crudeness and complexity of language.</p>","<p>Amélie Nothomb is a Belgian writer who works in French prose. Growing up, she lived in Japan, China, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. Stylistically, her writing is at the crossroads of medieval Japanese literature and Western literature. Principal themes in her work are the human condition and the role of the writer in a story. Some of her works, including <em>Métaphysique des Tubes</em>, feature an autobiographical element with the narrator as the principal character. She has received numerous awards and recognitions for her works, including the Grand Prix du Roman from the Academie Française and an appointment to the Belgian Royal Academy of French Language and Literature.</p>",<p>Kathleen Zhou is a senior in the Wharton School and regrets it only 40% of the time.</p>,French,fr,,,,,,,2016,submission

arrastadas pelo vento.
Riem alto de rijo, com a roupa na pedra 
e pōem de branco a roupa lavada.
As crianças brincam e a água canta.

Jazem quedos no regresso para a roça.","By the Água Grande*
Bound for the fields, by Água Grande, 
Black women beat and beat cloth against stone. 
They beat and sing songs of their home.
They sing and laugh laughs full of scorn, 
Tell stories… tossed into wind.
Strongly they laugh, keeping cloth against stone, 
Turning to white the cloth that they clean.
The children play! And the waters sing! 
The children in gay waters play…
Keeping baby black boy in the reeds.
…
The cries that the black women by the river sing 
Go quiet at the hour of return… Fall still returning to the fields.

*The Água Grande River runs through São Tomé’s most populated province, 
which is also called Água Grande.","<p>I have made what feel like thousands of attempts to properly translate Alda do Espírito Santo’s “Lá no Água Grande,” and have failed in each of them. But, here, I submit one such attempt for publication in the hopes that my translation can help shed light on this important poet.</p>","<p>As both writer and government leader, Alda do Espírito Santo played an essential role in São Tomé and Príncipe’s transition to independence from Portugal. She writes as a woman, to women, and for women, presenting her readers with images of strong women who have the power to liberate the islands from Portuguese colonial oppression. Despite her privileged upbringing, she dedicates her words to the working-class women of the islands who carried, both figuratively and literally, the future of the islands on their backs. The women she describes in poems like “By the Água Grande” are mothers, workers, and, most importantly, fighters.</p>
<p>Alda Espírito Santo’s poetry, which so lauded the islands’ women, celebrated and nourished a culture that relied on the power and strength of women. It points to the many ways in which women poets in Africa have played—and still play—an important role as agents for change in the liberated Portuguese colonies. Despite her influence in São Tomé, her poetry, like that of most Lusophone African (and especially women) writers, has been relegated to the periphery of post-colonial studies.</p>","<p>Marisa Bruno wrote her senior thesis on Alda do Espírito Santo, hoping to bring some attention to two marginalized categories of Lusophone (Portuguese-language) writers: African Lusophone writers and female Lusophone writers.

I focus on the new text and circle, underline, highlight all ideas that come up until there is more ink than words on the page. I then look at the original and take on more edits based on both the rough translation and the original. I rinse and repeat quite a bit over a day or two and then try to forget the whole matter ever happened. When I return to the poem, fresh connections usually appear. So far, this is what I have done with “The Paths.” The current version is still a quite humble attempt to carry over the images from Bulgarian to English. I have recently memorized the poem fully and have created a memory palace of sorts, with the hopes that this will aid me in future revisions.</p>","<p>Pavel Matev (Павел Матев, 1924–2006) is celebrated as one of the best lyricists in Bulgarian poetry. Growing up in the countryside, he devoted his work to the study of nature and love, and focused on the quiet, simple beauty of both.

Опять поминальный приблизился час.
Я вижу, я слышу, я чувствую вас:

И ту, что едва до окна довели,
И ту, что родимой не топчет земли,

И ту, что красивой тряхнув головой,
Сказала: “Сюда прихожу, как домой.”

Хотелось бы всех поименно назвать,
Да отняли список, и негде узнать.

Для них соткала я широкий покров
Из бедных, у них же подслушанных слов.

О них вспоминаю всегда и везде,
О них не забуду и в новой беде,

И если зажмут мой измученный рот,
Которым кричит стомильонный народ,

Пусть так же они поминают меня
В канун моего поминального дня.

А если когда-нибудь в этой стране
Воздвигнуть задумают памятник мне,

Согласье на это даю торжество,
Но только с условьем — не ставить его

Ни около моря, где я родилась:
Последняя с морем разорвана связь,

Ни в царском саду у заветного пня,
Где тень безутешная ищет меня,

А здесь, где стояла я триста часов
И где для меня не открыли засов.

Затем, что и в смерти блаженной боюсь
Забыть громыхание черных марусь,

Забыть, как постылая хлопала дверь
И выла старуха, как раненый зверь.

И пусть с неподвижных и бронзовых век
Как слезы, струится подтаявший снег,

И голубь тюремный пусть гулит вдали,
И тихо идут по Неве корабли.

<p>In the horrid years of the Yezhov terror I spent 
seventeen months waiting in line outside the prison 
in Leningrad. One day somebody “identified” me. 
Then, the woman who stood behind me, whose lips 
were blue from the cold, and who, of course, had not 
known who I was, came out of the stupor in which we 
all were and asked me in a whisper (everyone whispered there):</p>
<p>“Can you describe this?”</p>
<p>And I said, “I can.”</p>

which had once been a face.</p>

<h1>Requiem II.</h1>
 
Memorial hour strikes anew.
I see and I hear and I feel all of you —
 
The one whom we scarcely dragged to the window to breathe,
And the one who from earth’s bounds was set free,
 
And that one, shaking her beautiful head,
“I come here as if to my home,” she said.
 
Each one, name by name, I want to recount,
But the list was torn up; there’s no place to find out.
 
For them, I have woven a shroud out of words,
Out of their poor words, which I overheard.
 
Them — I remember, all the time, in every place, 
New woes cannot drive them from memory's space,
 
And if time clamps shut my long worn-out mouth,  
Through which a hundred million people shout,
 
Let the people recall me in a similar way
On the eve of my own memorial day.
 
And if at some point, this country should see
fit to erect a statue of me,
 
My consent I grant to this one note of grace,
But on one condition — that it be placed
 
Not near the sea, where I first opened my eyes:
With the sea I have long since severed all ties,
 
Not in the Tsar’s garden, near that much-cherished tree,
Where an inconsolable shadow searches for me,
 
But here,
where for three hundred hours I stood in wait
and where they didn't unbolt the iron-barred gate.
 
Because even in blissful death I fear
forgetting the clamor of the Black Marias,
 
forgetting how that dreaded car door banged
and that old mother wailing, like a wounded hound. 
 
And let the snow melt, in streams of tears, cries,
From the rims of my motionless, bronze-lidded eyes,
 
And let a prison dove coo, somewhere, far away,
And the ships sail softly by the Neva’s bay.

","<p>One distinct feature of Akhmatova’s poetry is that it is precise. Akhmatova reads as if there can be no other word or sound or even syllable stress for each image and no other image for each meaning. Although I chose to focus on staying as true to her images as possible, there were several places where I chose to stray from the images. One such place is in the fourth couplet, “and the list was torn up.” The Russian language makes use of embedded pronouns, so the original reads “and (they) took away the list,” with an implicit plural actor. However, I thought that using another “they” may create pronoun confusion in the translation. It would not be clear when the “they” refers to the regime and when to its victims. I therefore chose the passive. Another such place is in the seventh couplet, where the original reads “and if (they) clamp shut.” There, I chose to include an actor, although “time” is not true to the image or meaning in its full sense. It is not to time, ie. old age, that Akhmatova is referring, but to Stalin and his men. However, because the original only had an implicit “they,” I chose to avoid explicitly naming of Stalin in the translation. Another significant change I made is in the last line. The Neva, a river in Russia, has a riverbank, not a bay. However, I thought that the perfect rhyme in the end couplet was more important for the tone of the poem at its close than preserving a well-known geographic fact. I admit, however, that this may be a contentious point, and native Russian speakers have all the right and reason to disapprove of this choice. A fourth change is adding specificity to the images in the third-to-last couplet, where I thought that only those who had undergone those times would understand what kind of door was banging and who was wailing. As a final point, I wish to clarify that “Black Marias” are the police cars that would come to round up citizens, often at random, to bring them to jail, or worse. A fear of those black cars was ingrained in the generation of that time.</p>","<p>Anna Akhmatova (Анна Ахматова, 1899–1966) is one of the canonical poets of Russian literature. She grew up near the Black Sea port of Odessa. After studying literature in St. Petersburg, she, along with poets Osip Mandelstam and Sergey Gorodetsky, founded the Acmeism school of poetry, which valued the craft of poetry above its mysterious or symbolic qualities. Akhmatova was known for her rather terse, concise mode of expression, which soon became the model of a new form of expression for Russian women. Some of Akhmatova’s poems were, at a certain point, banned by Stalin, and still others remained unpublished, because they contained explicit anti-regime references. Despite that, her poetry continued to circulate throughout Russia. When her son was sentenced to ten years in a prison camp in Siberia, she attempted to have him released in various ways, including writing propaganda poetry for Stalin. During World War II, Akhmatova would read her poetry to soldiers in military hospitals, as well as write poems that reflected the voices of the people who were victims of Stalin’s regime. She became known as the poet of the Russian people.</p>","<p>Yehudith Dashevsky is a sophomore studying English literature with a concentration in poetry.

interview-with-suvir-kaul,An Exercise in Compromise: A Conversation about Literary Translation with Professor Suvir Kaul,,interview conducted by Shailly Pandey,,,,"<p>[<em>Editor’s Note: Suvir Kaul is the A.M. Rosenthal Professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania as well as the author of four books, including most recently </em>Of Garden and Graves<em>[1], a collection of his essays on the conflict in Kashmir as well as poems that Kaul has translated into English.</p>
<p>First published in local journals, the book’s poems were all written by authors — Hindu and Muslim alike — who at some point lived in Kashmir. They detail the conflict’s effects in the most intimate of ways, as their words are those of people who have directly suffered the consequences. Kashmir refers to the northernmost territories of India, the Himalayan regions that make up the border between India and Pakistan, and some parts of the Indo-Chinese border. India and Pakistan have been engaging in brutal, though sporadic, warfare since 1947, the year of Indian independence, over this land. Pakistan argues for control since Kashmir is an area of Muslim majority, while India claims that Pakistan has supported separatist groups fighting against government control.</p>
<p>The issue extends beyond politics, as Hindus and Muslims alike live in fear, not of each other but of military forces from both governments that crack down on their respective territories. They once lived in harmony and they now distrust each other. The only bridge between these two communities, these two countries, is their shared pain and the common language. </em>Of Gardens and Graves<em> includes classical forms, such as the </em>ghazal<em> and the </em>nazm<em>[2], as well as poems following the more spontaneous forms of the poet’s desire. These translations explore the chaos and anxieties that Kashmiri citizens face via the structure and artistry of poetry.</p>
<p></em>DoubleSpeak<em> was lucky enough to talk with Professor Kaul about his work, as well as the larger global scope of translation. Below is a transcript of our conversation followed by two excerpts from </em>Of Gardens and Graves<em>.</em>]</p>
<p><b>Shailly Pandey:</b> Why did you specifically choose poems written in Kashmiri? Is it because the poems you were looking for just happened to be written in it, or because Kashmiri is starting to die out?</p>
<p><b>Suvir Kaul:</b> Kashmiri is not dying at all, but it does not receive the kind of attention reserved for other major languages in India. But there is a reason why I only wanted Kashmiri poems in this book. There is lots of Urdu poetry in Kashmir. Urdu is the state language; it is the language taught in schools. Kashmiri [wasn’t] taught in school until very recently. It used to be the language of the home, of domesticity, of colloquialism on the street, not the official language.</p>
<p>Kashmiri is [also] a very idiomatic language. The idiom of spoken Kashmiri, even if you follow a casual street conversation, is particularly clever and inventive. Some of that is available in the poetry. It’s also a more intimate language. When someone in Kashmir wants to make a formal or important point, they will switch to Urdu. But if they’re just talking about the way they feel, within the family, between parents and children, they’ll be speaking Kashmiri. And it’s that intimacy that I find very attractive. Many of my friends said to me, “Here, these are wonderful poems, and they’re all in Urdu,” and I said no, this is a collection of Kashmiri poems.</p>
<p><b>Pandey:</b> Originally, was this meant to be a book of translation or a book of essays?</p>
<p><b>Kaul:</b> This didn’t begin as a project in translation of poetry at all. I kept writing longer, quasi-journalistic think-pieces about what I was seeing there in visits to my ancestral home in Srinagar. This wasn’t the Kashmir of my childhood. This wasn’t the Kashmir that most people around me, Hindu or Muslim, understood. They suffered it, but they didn’t understand it. So I started to write articles in my own effort to educate myself: What allowed us to get to this point? But I was still not tapping into something I might be able to do that other journalists or political observers would not be able to do. And that really is to try and generate an archive of poetry, and to use my skills as a literary critic, which is what I am by training, to say to people who pay attention only to political developments that if you really want to understand political feelings, it’s not only through formal politics alone that you understand them, but it’s also by turning to poetry, to cultural production. That’s what lies behind the addition of these poems to this project.</p>
<p>In my introduction, I speak about the poem “Corpse” by Shabir “Azar.” It’s an English translation of an Urdu poem, published in <em>Uzma Weekly</em>, a local Kashmiri newspaper. In 2014, there were these floods in Kashmir. I lost the Urdu original I had photocopied, and I have not been able to find it since, because the newspaper is no longer published and all other places I thought I would find it don’t have a copy either, either because of the flood or because of bad housekeeping. So the original Urdu from which I have translated, I no longer have. This is just one of the ironies of translating poems from Kashmir.</p>
<p>The other irony is that, when I began this project, I kept telling my friends that I was the wrong person to do it because my Kashmiri really isn’t good enough. But then I realized that more important than language facility was a desire peculiar to translation, and here I’ll use the phrase that is often bandied about in literary criticism: inhabiting the space of the other — the space of the other language, the other poet, etc., and doing so empathetically. As a matter of fact, you will not get any two Kashmiris to agree on what they think a single line of poetry means. It’s not literal meaning, so there will be a lot of discussion. But the discussion is the point. That’s when you begin to understand the manifold resources of poetic language, the way it allows people to find elements of themselves, their own experiences, their own differences in that space. That, for me, is what it means to think of translation not just simply as an individual encounter with language, but as a cultural engagement with language.</p>
<p><b>Pandey:</b> How did the fact that these originals were so susceptible to being lost forever change your process of first finding and then translating them, knowing that you’re preserving something that would have otherwise vanished?</p>
<p><b>Kaul:</b> I should note that not all of the journals or newspapers that these poems were published in will disappear like issues of low-circulation newspapers do, but it is true that publishing these poems is a way of preserving them and giving them new life in a second language. That’s the responsibility I learned to believe in. I knew I couldn’t include more than twenty-five or thirty poems in a book like this. So I was always looking for poems that I would think of as representative in some ways. I read and did drafts of a great many more poems than these, perhaps around one hundred and twenty, till I got to these poems. And so I suppose the choices are comparatively opportunistic; there’s not anything that represents a rock-solid archive. It’s a combing through elements.</p>
<p>One of the poems I discuss here, available only in my English translation, was actually brought to me on a scrap of paper. And that was because the person who wrote it is in jail. He’s never going to be publishing the poem, but he wrote it. For me, that is weightier than the kind of ephemeral quality suggested by a person in jail writing on scraps of paper and then passing it on to his brother who passed it on to a friend who passed it on to me because he knew I was interested in collecting these poems. My friends there kept telling me, “Look, what you’re doing is not inconsequential because at the very least, we’ll have a book that will preserve some of these poems and make them available.” It sounded a little grandiose and hyperbolic, but it’s not. It makes these twenty-five poems available. The fact is that English is an Indian language and indeed the global lingua franca by now. So any entry point into English is useful for local poets.</p>
<p><b>Pandey:</b> Out of those one hundred and twenty drafts, how did you pick — and order — those that you felt most engaged with the contemporary situation?</p>
<p><b>Kaul:</b> I was looking for poems that I thought were representative of what I believed to be certain emotions, states of feeling, forms, that are characteristic of the larger volume of poems. Yes, there are a great many <em>ghazals</em> here, but then there are <em>ghazals</em> that use the form of the <em>ghazal</em>, precisely the repetition that you are asking about, to emphasize the disorderly conditions that obtain in Kashmir. It’s a very odd phenomenon: you are using a very regular form, a form that is structured around repetitions, but the events you’re describing, the feelings you’re describing, are those of endless rupture, frustration, fear, anxiety, misery. To an extent, these are personal choices, so once I felt I had found a poem that worked with a conventional form, but did it interestingly, innovatively, those were the kinds of poems I chose.</p>
<p>And then it came to deciding how to order the book. I went back and forth with the order for a long time… and it’s not as if I can offer you a precise template that governed my decisions, but there was a sense in which I wanted, in the beginning, to open with poems that spent time describing what Kashmir felt like to people on the way to its becoming alienating or disturbed. And then I wanted poems that were innovative in form, that aren’t necessarily <em>nazms</em> or <em>ghazals</em>. I’ll give you an instance of what I mean. A poem like Naji Munawar’s “Then and Today,” is staged as a little dialogue. We don’t know who these people are, but you can guess the situation. Slightly older people, a man and a woman, sitting inside their home, the light is off, there’s fear in the air. “Now what are you getting enraged about?” asks one of them (I imagine it is the man), and the question is the little turn in the poem. Or rather, the answer is the unexpected irony: “Alas then it used to be said the darkness might swallow — / and now the light truly comes to devour.” The context of this poem, and why it’s particularly evocative, is the so-called crack-downs that became a feature of Kashmiri villages and small town life. Everyone turns off the lights. The police and the military are outside. You’re really scared. Light, when you see it, is not something that brings hope; it brings the chances of unwarranted attention. So this was a poem I found really startling precisely because of its form.</p>
<p><b>Pandey:</b> You could very clearly see that some poems followed a conventional form, and some didn’t; they were just written in a moment, in the way they were meant to be written.</p>
<p><b>Kaul:</b> Exactly. Those poems are much more urgent in their sense of things. The last couple of poems will tell you what my own hopes are. Som Nath Bhat Veer’s poem, “A New Day will Dawn,” is a song of hope in the middle of this misery, as is Zahid Mukhtar’s poem, “Who will change our destiny?” These are not poets I know, but I made it my business, once I had chosen their poems, to try and find them. Kashmir is still a small enough world that if I made phone calls to my friends, they would make phone calls to their friends, and somebody or other would be in touch with these poets, and many of them were on email.</p>
<p>When I wrote to Zahid Mukhtar and I sent him this translation, he wrote back very kindly. He said “You know, I’m very touched that you have chosen to do this,” because I am a Hindu, and he is not, and that is part of the unfortunate, polarizing of life in Kashmir. And he said, and this was his phrase that I mention in my book, “It must be that our common pain which I have attempted to describe in my mother tongue,” which I found a very hopeful sentiment. It’s an almost lost sentiment, but that’s the only sentiment that allows for hope. So that’s why I close the book with these two poems, both of which look forward.</p>
<p><b>Pandey:</b> I’m assuming Som Nath Bhat was Hindu?</p>
<p><b>Kaul:</b> He is Hindu, and Zahid Mukhtar is Muslim. Arjun Dev Majboor, whose poem is at the beginning of the book, is Hindu, and the next poet in the book is Muslim.</p>
<p><b>Pandey:</b> You translate a line in Maqbool Sajid’s <em>ghazal</em> as, “Eyes upon eyes weep, now what is left,” and in a note below the poem you explain, “It could also be translated as ‘Word upon word weeps, now what is left.’” You made notes like this in a few other poems too, I think. I remember specifically the translation of <em>jigar</em>[3]: I thought about it long and hard, and I couldn’t think of a word for it in English. It’s not quite “heart.” How did you translate these lines that didn’t have an exact meaning in English, or that could be interpreted one of two ways?</p>
<p><b>Kaul:</b> In the second edition, the version I’ve decided to use is, “Word upon word weeps here, now what is left.” Why? A literary friend pointed out that the duality of meaning might well be the result of poor copyediting of the original. Here is the problem: when Urdu is written in Nastaliq[4], vowel markers are often dropped. So you literally have to recognize the word to be able to tell what kind of vowel to use. Now, Kashmiri has a great many more vowel markers, but when the poetry is printed in these journals, very often the calligrapher or the typesetter doesn’t use these vowel markers. In the original that I saw of this poem, the phrase <em>ashar, ashar</em> could have been read as <em>akshar, akshar</em>. It’s a question of uncertain or missing vowel markers, so I maintained both meanings. But then in conversation after the book was published, my friend said, “Look, it’s unlikely to have been that, I bet it was a typo.” I was persuaded by her to drop the original translation I had used, and now in the new edition that note has disappeared.</p>
<p><b>Pandey:</b> Is all of Kashmiri written in Nastaliq?</p>
<p><b>Kaul:</b> Not quite, but increasingly so. This is part of what happens to language in a polarized situation. The original script of Kashmiri was a script called Sharda, which looks like Devnagari[5] but with additional consonants and vowel sounds. That script has disappeared. Sadly, what happened is that if you are a Muslim who writes in Kashmiri, you will prefer to write it in Nastaliq, plus Kashmiri vowel sounds with these new vowel markers. The state literary academy, the Sahitya Academy, is actually formulating ways in which this language can be orthographically more precise than it is when written in Nastaliq as Urdu is written. But a great many Hindus who write in Kashmiri choose to write it in Devanagri.</p>
<p><b>Pandey:</b> So the language itself is becoming cut in half.</p>
<p><b>Kaul:</b> The language itself is being represented in two different scripts. The future is likely to remain based in Nastaliq, because the largest numbers of users are those who write in Urdu, and know Nastaliq, and are likely to write Kashmiri in it. The language politics are interesting. Ever since this was a Dogra kingdom[6], that is, before independence and partition, the official language of the court was Urdu. Never Kashmiri. English was used, and Urdu was used: these were the languages of classical, literary, and philosophical education. Kashmiri was the people’s tongue; it was literally the vernacular.</p>
<p><b>Pandey:</b> When you started, did you think you were going to preserve the very apparent musicality of the <em>ghazals</em> and <em>nazms</em>, or did you know it wouldn’t be possible?</p>
<p><b>Kaul:</b> As I said, Kashmiri is very idiomatic. The hardest terms to translate from one language to another are idioms. There were times when I abandoned the effort. It would make no sense in English. It’s always a series of compromises. But when I read them in English, if I didn’t know the Kashmiri, I would sometimes think that there’s not a very particularly melodic progression in each of the lines. There are moments in the original with alliterative sounds and certain kinds of repetition, but it is just not possible to replicate all of them in English and retain meaning.</p>
<p>Thus, and these are difficulties you discover, you always hope to find an idiom, a certain phrasing or a tone that will replicate the original. Then you recognize that is only aspiration, that it is not how it works in practice. Translation is as much compromise as anything else. The best I can claim for these translations is that [they] are compromises that [hopefully] work as poetry in English. I know some translators think of their writing as transcreation. They will take what they understand to be the sentiment, the approximate meaning, sometimes the arresting images of the original, and rewrite them into the new language, generating essentially a poem in response to that [original] poem, a poem that is much more overtly poetical in the new language. And that’s not what I was prepared to do. I wasn’t prepared to overwrite what I took to be some of the characteristic features of the original. And there the real challenge began, because you can’t overwrite, yet you can’t remain entirely faithful to the original.</p>
<p><b>Pandey:</b> How did you get from your very literal, word-for-word first drafts to this finished product? That’s kind of a big step.</p>
<p><b>Kaul:</b> Of course it is. But it isn’t a single step; it’s many steps. And many steps that you redo and go over and fix again. I wish I could say to you that here is a single principle I used, and this is what enabled me to keep redrafting. There was no single principle. You see something really arresting idiomatically and you think, “Okay, I’m going to find a way to replicate that idiom,” but what do you do with the rest of the line? You have to produce syntax that will allow it to make sense in English. You feel your way through this. And you recognize that you risk someone else [saying], “This particular image ought to have resulted in this kind of translation.”</p>
<p>Once you recognize it in the original, trying to find a way of recreating it in the new language doesn’t always work, but it becomes one more thing you are alerted to. You have to find these little elements of the original and somehow find a way to bring as many of them over with you. That’s what compromise means. I think working compromises are precisely getting translation right.</p>
<p><b>Pandey:</b> You talked about these poems engaging with contemporary circumstance, and of course what’s happening in Kashmir right now is very near to your heart. When you were compiling these essays and poems, did you mean them as political statement or did you mean them to just say, “This is what Kashmir is,” or something else entirely?</p>
<p><b>Kaul:</b> You know, when you’ve been doing what I’ve been doing for as long as I have, you no longer believe that anything can stand on its own. My very choice of this project, my decision to take it from individual essays to these translations is political too… but part of the work of these translations is a sign of my own desperation. When you go there and you visit… my parents would be there, and my mother and my sister…  I would look around and say, “What I see here is not India, this is not democracy, this is not anything I love and value about India.” And then you think “Okay, so then what?”</p>
<p>And the answer is that I’m not going to become a politician, or a political theorist, or an advisor to the governor, but I have certain skills that can, I hope, generate the picture of a world under siege, both in terms of its cultural productivity in these poems, but also in terms of my own understanding and my own commentary. To that extent, it is meant to be an intervention. If people read this, I hope the book will change their mind, so that the “Kashmir problem” doesn’t remain a binary between India and Pakistan, as if Kashmiris do not matter. It’s a very mottled, ugly history that has been put into place there. I think of myself as an Indian. I think of myself as a democrat. I think of myself as a Kashmiri. Those three terms right now are not in easy alignment. So that’s what this book is meant to be. It’s almost a cry, in its own minor key, that says, “Pay attention.”</p>
<p><b>Pandey:</b> I also saw it as a small reconciliation of some of the differences, because you’ve published Hindus and Muslims side by side, because you chose to stick to Kashmiri, which is written in both Nastaliq and Devnagari. You know, Kashmiri is literally a bridge between those two communities, which is special and rare.</p>
<p><b>Kaul:</b> That’s what I argue: that it’s in Kashmiri that you find commonality. In the language, the common pain, the common history, and I hope the common future. I wrote this book fully cognizant that I am a Hindu writing about what is commonly perceived to be a Muslim problem. But it’s not a Muslim problem alone. It’s a Kashmiri problem, and it’s a problem for Indians who are democrats. I’m hoping that if this book enacts the necessity of empathizing with those who have suffered, it will work as a model for those who live and work in Kashmir too. I hope that young Muslims will start thinking of the kinds of resources of culture and community that have been lost in the last so many years, as the bulk of Hindus have left. I hope Pandits (which is what Kashmiri Hindus are called) will work to extend their own feelings of loss and alienation into empathy for all that their Muslim neighbors have suffered. And, projects like this one and other parallel ones are an attempt to say there is a commonality of language, expression, feeling, belief, not religious belief in its particularity, but belief in something larger, that needs to be rebuilt.</p>

When I am listening, or walking, or talking to someone, I pick out their words and I save them. Sometimes these are words from my mother tongue, the language I heard before all else. Sometimes these are words I could not locate in that tongue but found first in English or French. A notebook full of written words I want to say: “seeps,” “salt,” “mulberry.” And the words I extend into other languages from Turkish: <em>susuz</em>: “without water.” <em>Rüya</em>: “dream.” <em>Uzaklık</em>: “distance.” My <em>uzaklık</em> belongs to a simple intention. “A’dan b’ye olan uzaklan”: “the distance from point A to point B.” From Istanbul to Philadelphia, two flights: 9,649 kilometers. From Istanbul to Moscow, where the poet Nâzım Hikmet fled to exile after decades in prison: 1,753 kilometers. He would die there after writing “Things I Didn’t Know I Loved.” The sun I have loved it seems, even as it sets, covered in sour cherry marmalade. With Hikmet my <em>uzaklık</em> reappeared. Changing, unstable, the word “distance” multiplies and scatters. It’s a physical space, and it’s inside the mind. And it’s between hearts. There’s a deadly distance.</p>

13 November 1945

Black news coming from my distanced city:
the city of honest laborers, of poor people —
my genuine Istanbul,
my love, that city which is your place
so wherever I am driven out to, whichever prison I am in,
on my back, in the sack I carry
and like pain for a lost child in my heart,
the city I keep, in my eyes, like a dream of you…</em></pre>

<p>All these things I have loved all this time, it seems, and yet never knew. I had not known Nâzım the prisoner. Nâzım the lover. Only a name, Nâzım Hikmet, one of our poets, here in Istanbul. He had slipped away between so many other words; to whom those other words belonged I could never remember. My city, where I was born and raised, where my mother and father were born and raised, where I lived for seventeen years, fourteen years at the same school with the same seventy people. A stranger in a strange place there, yet I still don’t belong anywhere else. My city, eight thousand kilometers away from me, at five thousand miles’ distance; I’m sitting in class and a teacher — a stranger — writes Atatürk on the board. We’re talking about Turkey in the twentieth century as I set up my presentation on Hikmet. None of the students know who he is. We had just met too, in a way, Nazım and I. Two strangers, now side by side. Hikmet was sentenced to twenty-eight years in prison in 1938. After twelve of them he was exiled, his nationality revoked. He went to Russia, but his lover was left behind. Piraye, the lover I know from his “9pm–10pm” poems, which he wrote each night in prison before lights out. Hikmet, one of many who were silenced, but one of few who managed to scream. I share the scream, share my <em>uzaklık</em> with the class. His <em>uzaklık</em>.</p>

<p>“Just as the manifestations of life are intimately connected with the phenomenon of life without being of importance to it, a translation issues from the original – not so much from its life as from its afterlife.” – Walter Benjamin, “The Task of the Translator.”</p>

<p>It’s strange to encounter his afterlife, Hikmet in translation.</p>

<p>“All purposeful manifestations of life, including their very purposiveness, in the final analysis have their end not in life, but in the expression of its nature, in the representation of its significance […] Languages are not strangers to one another, but are, a priori and apart from all historical relationships, interrelated in what they want to express.” Reading Benjamin, I think about how Hikmet’s resistance to silence echoes through Turkey now, his manifestation of life so clear and insistent that I can hear him singing in the prison cell even before I learn that he was locked away. His afterlife survives, traveling from one language to another, bringing him closer to me.</p>

<p>In a video that his last love, Vera, made, I see him dancing in Moscow, spinning round and around on the grass, near the end of his life.</p>

<p>I silently read his poem, “On Living,” in English:</p>

<em><pre style=""text-indent: 10px"">Living is no laughing matter:
You must live with great seriousness
like a squirrel.</pre>

<p>My mother taught me to live <em>sincap gibi</em> (“like a squirrel”), to take life lightly but to live seriously, amorously, <em>sımsıkı tutunarak</em> (“holding on tightly”). I remembered, from the echo of the original, Hikmet’s words that were with me at a distance. They multiply. I multiply. Questions multiply. The students around me ask, “Who is Atatürk?” They don’t know the face that hangs next to the clock in every classroom of my childhood. Every Monday morning, every Friday before class is dismissed, the face projected upon the Turkish flag as we sing the national anthem. Atatürk, and with him, fake nostalgia. I am afraid to speak of him now, of this man or god, but I know the minds of the students around me are untouched, that Atatürk is just a name. So I speak despite the fear. I tell them of how poisonously my people cling to him, transformed him into a euphemism for fascism. I try to explain how thoughtlessly we praise the past and think that it can resurrect in the present. What a narcissistic view of history, textbooks full of instruction without vitality.</p>

<p>What I don’t say to my class is that it was against this void that I began searching. Like a survival instinct, a defense: What I believed my language obscured, or didn’t allow me to know, I tried to find in English. And English was trying to find something in me. Already in the twentieth century as the modern Turkish alphabet left behind an Arabic script, English was being taught as a second language in schools. It had already invaded who I was going to be, before I was born. A problem of unwritten genealogy. (“Genealogy.” A word Nietzsche taught me in a class during my freshman year. It was in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> that I encountered it first, a way to describe the relationship of things to one another. A string of points in history, points in time, their distance from one another connected by a motive. <em>Uzaklık</em>. Distance.)</p>

<p>In my Istanbul classrooms, yesterday and today were always forgotten. History would not be found in poetry, in individuals, in honest words. So the history of my birthplace became what I could glean from my mother’s childhood. She grew up in the seventies, and she’d play on the streets for hours with her brother and his friends. I look at a black-and-white photograph of my mother and my uncle, neither older than ten and with the same boyish haircut. They’re running in a field with a ball. I never played on the streets of my neighborhood, or threw a ball to kids there.</p>

<p>Someone in the class asks me about the present. The nostalgia is blinding, vicious; the fields are gone, and there are no children. I suddenly remember the little boy who died when I was in high school, in between the sadness of forgetting him. Only five, he goes out to get bread for his family. A tear gas canister takes his life. Only two years ago. I tell the students sitting around me about the Gezi Park protests, which started when the government decided to demolish Gezi Park, one of the few remaining green spaces in Istanbul; the Prime Minister’s plans included the construction of a shopping mall, a mosque, and Ottoman Empire replicas in its place. A community started to gather in the park, made up of people from all over Istanbul; some even stayed in tents overnight. They wrote, and they sang, and they shared with each other. But words are dangerous. The demonstrations were broken up when the police arrived; they used water cannons and tear gas, beat the protestors and burned their tents. Many lost their lives. <em>Vatan hainleri</em> (“Traitors of the nation”). Journalists and poets, kids, college students, people passing by, a boy buying bread. I learned what was going on through friends and family. All social media was blocked. All communication forbidden. News channels went black. A terrifying darkness. A darkness that was already everywhere, but one I hadn’t seen, one I was distanced from. The point from A to B. An intention. Hikmet’s exile had entered into those dying on the streets. An afterlife. Yet how can it be so dangerous to write? I wanted to tell the students sitting around me and watching, puzzled, how with Hikmet’s poetry began a yearning for the language that thought me. The language of my first signs. A drive to uncover fragments, doubles, associations and so, to recover the skin that was peeled off:</p>

<em><pre style=""text-indent: 10px"">i am a kid
and the skin of a peach
fuzzy and foreign
is too strange on my tongue.
impatient
i skin the peach</em></pre>

<p>“But you don’t sound Turkish,” say countless voices.</p>

<p>What is a skinless peach? What is it to sound Turkish, or to look Turkish, or to feel Turkish? Is it the <em>r</em> that rolls too strongly, the <em>t</em> that is a touch sharper, the <em>o</em> that is not round enough? <em>Hatirlamak</em>, “to remember,” its <em>t</em> carves itself on the tongue and then immediately pours into that rolling <em>r</em> — they hiss together as they’re lost into the <em>l</em> and solidified with that final <em>k</em>. <em>Mor</em>, “purple,” its <em>o</em> like a ring of smoke, slightly imperfect, how it sounds like an impatient “more.” I miss my voice, so I get lost thinking of it. The violets in my garden are riddled with circles where caterpillars have bitten through; an image of these violets comes to mind. What is it inside of me upon which English intrudes? And how. In the garden, next to the violets, my father is sitting in his green chair. Legs crossed. <em>Yaz kokuyor</em>: “it smells like summer.” His beloved season, my father, a boy in the sun. He plays “My Heart Belongs to Daddy” for me, and sings along with Eartha Kitt. We dance on the grass, my hand the size of his thumb. Innocence, like honey melting in warm milk. Which is how English seeped into my thoughts. I am drinking warm milk with honey, enveloped in my mother’s bed as she reads <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em> in English. My uncle lived in Los Angeles at the time, and he would bring us suitcases filled with books. Shel Silverstein’s <em>Falling Up</em> and <em>The Giving Tree</em>, <em>The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane</em> by Kate DiCamillo, <em>James and the Giant Peach</em>, and <em>The Little Prince</em>. I would insist that my mother read to me about the Wild Things, and how Max would tame them with the words “Be still,” and how their hearts were as soft as their fur, and the look in their eyes. One night I sat up straight in bed while still asleep, turned, and pointed toward my mother, saying: “Be still!” Do I dream in and with language, then? Was I even dreaming? I don’t remember. In all of us I think there is this urge to say certain things, to speak certain words. And we carry them with us, like ants swarming in and around our body, little particles waiting to escape. Maybe when our guards are down, they speak with us.</p>  

<p>I came across an interview of Eartha Kitt once, not too long ago. She’s been asked, “Isn’t love a union between two people? Or does Eartha fall in love with herself?” Eartha lets out that divine laugh, long, devilish, and sublime: “Yes. I fall in love with myself, and I want someone to share it with me. I want someone to share me with me.” To want to know someone, or something, completely — not for just one moment in time but for all the moments preceding. To let them be themselves, and to love only that. And how can such a want manifest in translation? I watch Eartha as she sits against a backdrop of pink flowers, the same ones my grandmother loved; her gaze meets mine for an instance as she speaks. I feel in awe as I sense her strength, her sensitivity, her respect for herself. Eartha Kitt, one of many who exist as a fragment of me. Eartha, carved in my memory. She slips back into existence from time to time, somehow knowing when to reappear. I’m sitting on the carpet floor of my apartment in Philadelphia. It’s nighttime and my living room is illuminated by broken string lights. I’m tired and all I want to do is lie on the floor. I put on <em>The Best of Eartha Kitt</em>. “Après Moi” begins to play with a crackle. We’ve been friends for a long long time, we’ve shared again and again; we like the same clothes and we like the same wine. I get up to make coffee, and gather my books to work. The record continues now, and I don’t notice the passing songs. My guard is down. Unfamiliar words with familiar sounds capture me through the recorded songs. “Üşküdar'a gider iken…” She’s singing “On the way to Üsküdar,” but in Turkish, and with the most charming of errors; she utters my beloved <em>ş</em> instead of <em>s</em>. How is it I’ve never noticed, the countless times I’ve played this album? It’s a subtle difference, but you can feel it inside of your cheeks, a puff of warm wind. <em>Ş</em>, pronounced “sh.” I sit and listen to this Turkish ballad we learned in music class when I was eleven years old. Now I’m nineteen and she speaks to me, sings my country’s tale of a nineteenth-century woman in love with her much younger clerk. He is hers, and she, his. “Kâtibimi arar iken yanımda buldum” … “As I was looking for him, I found him beside me.”</p>

<p>I am Max. Sitting on my white carpet in my living room in West Philadelphia. My walls become a forest. I do not know under whose sky I am. But my mother has left soup on the bedside table, the supper that, for my wildness, I was once denied. On the way to Üsküdar. I breathe in the displacement. Even as I write now, I feel I am imitating an intimacy I can’t truly grasp. It’s fragmented. I caught myself divided, thinking in English, and something shifted. I sing, soundless, with the afterlife of Eartha’s voice. I sit with her ghost figure scattered in my mind, accepting the mystery. In between languages, I have come to accept uncertainty, distance, <em>susuzluk</em> (“thirst”). I leap with the words from myself, unfolding with their translated lives. <em>Sıvılaşmış</em>. “Liquefied.” Mine sounds warm, with its doubled <em>ş</em>, whispering, melting matter, muddy with its muted, unembellished, <em>ı</em>. The other, “liquefied,” whose knifelike <em>q</em> is absent in my alphabet: how in the beginning it’s crystallized, and then dissolves. Hiss of water touching ice. Both words belong to the same substance, amalgamated, only different in form. And where they touch, so lightly, they absorb each other. “Su kristalleşir, buz sıvılaşmış” (“Water is crystallized, ice liquefied”). And I live right here in the middle, sometimes far, sometimes close, as now, when I listen to my mother tongue in this beloved other’s voice. <em>Üskü Dara</em>. A split destination, Üsküdar cut in half. My white walls reappear, and with them that capital “I” that is becoming. That grand “I” which I still cannot embrace. The “I” that I don’t want: the excess of the first person — too great and everywhere. A longing: “kendini paylaşan küçük ‘ben’” (“the little ‘i’ that shares itself”). An “I” distanced from its action, scattered almost physically. Some words I have saved: <em>içimde</em> (“inside of me”), <em>dışımda</em> (“outside of me”), <em>papatyalarım</em> (“my daises”), <em>ölüyorum</em> (“I am dying”). In translation, my “I” is separated. Severed. I want to catch it as it runs off.</p>

<p>Driving to the western coast from Istanbul, I’m in the backseat, six years old, maybe seven, maybe nine, watching asphalt turn into sunflowers and then asphalt again. A memory outside of my Istanbul, where most memories had to belong. A memory from point A to point B. White storks wander in the fields. A few small stone houses, trembling, the smoke from their chimneys are different from the clouds. I watch a donkey waiting in the shade, his neck tied to the tree. “O gözleri mahzun eşek.” “That donkey with tragic eyes.” I remember him and sorrow overtakes me. And as we drive, I cry from time to time at what I see on that ten-hour road. We travel through everlasting moonflower fields. <em>Ayçiçekleri</em> (“Ay: Moon. Sunflowers”). My dad plays music throughout the entire drive, and I listen. “Le Vent Nous Portera” by the French band Noir Desir is playing: “Je n’ai pas peur de la route. Un instantané de velours. Et mon tapis volant dis? Le vent l’emportera.” (“I’m not afraid of the road. An instant of velvet. And my flying carpet says? The wind will carry us”). I don’t listen to that song much anymore. Now when we drive I put my headphones on, and listen to my own songs. But then, when I was six or seven or nine, among the moonflowers and all the distance between A and B, my parents shared with me all that was shared with them: The Beatles, Billie Holiday, Patti Smith, Lou Reed, Serge Gainsbourg, Hendrix, Zeppelin, Tom Waits. Faceless voices that meant so much to me. Some I lost and they never found their way back, some I met throughout the years. I do not belong to them, perhaps, but parts of them now belong to me. Billie sings:</p>

<em><pre style=""text-indent: 10px"">Yesterdays, yesterdays
Days I knew as happy sweet
Sad am I, glad am I
For today I’m dreamin’ of yesterdays</em></pre>

<p>She shares herself with me. I share myself with her afterlife. A translated afterlife. Doubled. And so now I think about memory, the language of memories. I think of the many ways of representing the same thing. Noticing I am in between two wholly distanced ways of thinking, I undergo a change. A sort of alchemy. I see how a world outside of my own has seeped in, sweet like honey; it felt so natural that I missed the transition, and the loss. Whatever matter formed me before has amalgamated with another, and I am forgotten. In parting. “Not how one soul comes close to another but how it moves away shows me their kinship and how much they belong together” (Nietzsche, <em>On the Genealogy of Morality</em>).</p>

<p>I look behind words. I look at their history, the points where they entered my history. <em>Ayçiçekleri</em>. “Moonflowers.” I will never say “this is this and this” because on the way from one to nineteen, I realize that no one meaning seals one word. So I laugh with the forgetfulness of rigid, indestructible definitions, and I let them multiply. My kingdom is of this world, says Nietzsche: “He collects from everything he sees, hears, lives through, his sum. He is always in his own company, whether he associates with books, human beings, or landscapes: he honors by choosing, by admitting, by trusting. He knows how to forget.” This figure who I want to be. Noticing how written words travel, and speak, in the strangest form. We are like pickpockets, stealing letters from Eartha and Nietzsche and countless others. Stealing philosophies, and placing them somewhere in between ourselves and those from whom they came. I translate for myself, and in a way, like Eartha, I share me with me. <em>Birleşiyorum</em> (“I’m fusing”).</p>

<p>Every word a point of memory. I leap again, from myself, out the window and soar above the yellow. I’m in a train, by the window. Nineteen, my headphones on, from New York to Philadelphia. I watch red, rusty steel turn into concrete, into ghost towns with broken windows, into a mixture of grey and green, undiscovered fields. I’m listening to Tom Waits as I travel from home to home, in the train, to Philadelphia: “Come closer, don’t be shy, stand beneath the rainy sky, the moon is over the rise, think of me as a train goes by. Lay down in the green grass. Remember when you loved me.” The yellow fields slowly fade into the industrial landscape. I look at the factories, those factories I despised back home: here now they look like magic. Now at night, their clouds turn into fire. I watch these burning steel stars illuminate everything. A new memory sits next to the old; they look at each other and smile. “Üskü dara gider iken… Üsküdar’a gider iken…” The same but split. The distance from <em>üskü</em> to <em>dara</em>. That is where I lie now in my apartment, on my white carpet, in West Philadelphia, knowing that somehow somewhere point A and B meet. I listen to the song my father cried to as we drove:</p>

<em><pre style=""text-indent: 10px"">Yuksek Yuksek Tepelere:
Babamın Bir Atı Olsa Binse De Gelse,
Annemin Yelkeni Olsa Açsa Da Gelse,
Kardeşlerim Yolları Bilse De Gelse.
 
To the tall tall hills:
I wish my father had a horse so he could ride it and come to me
I wish my mother had a sail so she could open it and come to me
I wish my siblings knew the way so they could come to me</em></pre>

<p>I am not satisfied with the word “nostalgia.” What I feel is not just longing, or missing my home. It is a rush of wind, stained with the violets in my garden, and the soup on the table, and the gloves Holden lost, and how his mother got mad at him, and the wild things that were told to be still, and became still, and the donkey with the almond eyes, and Eartha’s purr. I breathe in a violet wind. And as I breathe out, the wind takes something into the distance. Some sort of matter. It’s as if the wind takes the tangible away. As if my scarf has fluttered off, but the warmth it gave me remains. So whenever I am cold, I wait for another wind to blow it back to me. And it does, from time to time.</p>

<p>“Once a little boy sent me a charming card with a little drawing on it. I loved it. I answer all my children’s letters — sometimes very hastily — but this one I lingered over. I sent him a card and I drew a picture of a Wild Thing on it. I wrote, ‘Dear Jim: I loved your card.’ Then I got a letter back from his mother and she said, ‘Jim loved your card so much he ate it.’ That to me was one of the highest compliments I’ve ever received. He didn’t care that it was an original Maurice Sendak drawing or anything. He saw it, he loved it, he ate it.” — Maurice Sendak</p>

<p>I ate the peach, swallowed the violet wind. I lost the gloves but not the warmth. “Sımsıkı tutunarak uzakligin kendisine” (“Holding on tightly to distance itself”). I let the distance keep itself. And I let myself flutter from point A to point B… “yeryüzünü dönülmez bir yolculuğa çıkmışım gibi seyrederek,” as Hikmet says at the end of his poem “Things I Didn’t Know I Loved”: watching as if I’m on a journey with no return to earth.</p>",,"<p>Keyla Çavdar is a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying English and fine arts.

She was reintroduced to revolutionary Turkish poet Nâzım Hikmet in Taije Silverman’s translation class in the spring of 2016; Hikmet’s poetry made it possible for her to understand not only the current political climate in Turkey, but also the implications of losing one’s country and language. Translation enabled her to dwell in the space between her mother tongue, Turkish, and her second language, English.

and still, flake after flake falls
since morning, unfulfilled.
We’re in the kitchen.
On the table, atop the cloth, spring —
on the table, atop the cloth, a tender little cuke,
with bumpy husk and blossomed stalk. 
We surround it, staring.
Its cool glow soothes our faces
with a satin sweep.
How fresh its scent, how fresh —
We surround it, staring —
baffled
pensive
light
as if we’re in a dream.
On the table, atop the cloth, hope —
on the table, atop the cloth, mended pep,
a cloud set to spill
a sprouting sun,
seas of eager seeds
nearby,
blooming loves uncovered.

Moscow, March 1960
","<p>Due to what some might call an unusual affinity towards cucumbers, I was immediately drawn to this poem by Nâzım Hikmet. While it was the title that initially caught my attention, it was Hikmet’s descriptions and language (and the feelings they evoked) that drew me to translate the poem. The first line of “Cucumber” talks about the snow outside piling up, despite it being the start of spring. In a conspicuously similar manner, while I was reading the poem one April morning in Philadelphia, it began to snow outside of the library! Through my translation, I sought to replicate the essence of sincere (but slightly irrational) hope — for spring, for a fresh start, for change — as present in Hikmet’s words today as it was years ago.</p>","<p>Nâzım Hikmet (1902-1963) was a Turkish poet, playwright, and revolutionary figure. His political views and support for communism often landed him in jail, where he wrote much of his poetry. His poetry was looked to by much of Turkey’s youth as the poetry of the revolution. He is considered Turkey's first modern poet and was influenced by the Russian Futurist movement. Finally released from jail after starting a hunger strike (which was then joined by international figures), Hikmet moved to the Soviet Union, where he was very well-received.</p>","<p>Monica Wojciechowski grew up in Denville, NJ, but considers Poland to be her second home. She spent this past summer traveling through Eastern and Central Europe, and she stayed with family in Poland’s countryside, harvesting fruit, taking long walks, picking mushrooms, and translating poetry. Nothing makes Monica happier than sharing her heritage with others; whether through stories, food, music, or language, she is always grateful for the opportunity to do so. It was not until recently that Monica discovered the captivating world of literary translation, but now that she has, she doesn’t plan on leaving it anytime soon.</p>",Turkish,tr,,,,,,,2016,submission

Разве я немного не красив?
Не смотря в лицо, от страсти млеешь,
Мне на плечи руки опустив.

Молодая, с чувственным оскалом,
Я с тобой не нежен и не груб.
Расскажи мне, скольких ты ласкала?
Сколько рук ты помнишь? Сколько губ?

Знаю я — они прошли, как тени,
Не коснувшись твоего огня,
Многим ты садилась на колени,
А теперь сидишь вот у меня.

Пусть твои полузакрыты очи,
И ты думаешь о ком-нибудь другом,
Я ведь сам люблю тебя не очень,
Утопая в дальнем дорогом.

Этот пыл не называй судьбою,
Легкодумна вспыльчивая связь,—
Как случайно встретился с тобою,
Улыбнусь, спокойно разойдясь.

Да и ты пойдешь своей дорогой
Распылять безрадостные дни,
Только нецелованных не трогай,
Только негоревших не мани.

И когда с другим по переулку
Ты пройдешь, болтая про любовь,
Может быть, я выйду на прогулку,
И с тобою встретимся мы вновь.

Отвернув к другому ближе плечи
И немного наклонившись вниз,
Ты мне скажешь тихо: «Добрый вечер!»
Я отвечу: «Добрый вечер, miss».

И ничто души не потревожит,
И ничто ее не бросит в дрожь, —
Кто любил, уж тот любить не может,
Кто сгорел, того не подожжешь.","You don’t love me, you don’t pity me.
Don’t you find me at least a little handsome?
You won’t look at my face but you lose control
with your hands on my shoulders.

You’re young, sensual, teeth bared;
I’m neither gentle with you nor rough.
Tell me, how many have you caressed?
How many hands have you touched? How many lips?

I know — they passed like shadows
without touching your flame.
You’ve made your home on many laps
and now you’re here on mine.

I’ll let you keep your eyes half-shut,
maybe I’m not the one you want to see.
I’m not head over heels either,
drowning in the treasured past.

Don’t call this ardour destiny,
this connection of ours quick to spark —
as easily as I fell into you,
I’ll find it just as easy to part.

And so will you, you’ll find your path,
leaving unhappy days in your wake.
Just don’t touch those who haven’t been kissed,
just don’t tempt those who haven’t been burned.

And when you’re out with another,
strolling arm-in-arm, talking about love,
maybe you’ll see me crossing the street,
and you and I will meet again.

You’ll lean into your companion
and with a tilt of your head,
you’ll whisper to me: “Good evening!”
and I’ll answer: “Good evening, miss.”

And nothing will worry my soul,
and nothing will drive it to shiver —
one who has loved won’t love again,
one who has burned won’t ignite.","<p>I tried to keep the tone if not light then at least uncomplicated. This was tricky for me; I must confess to a fondness for fluffy words. Russian grammar allows for relatively easy rhyming; I chose to forgo an attempt at Yesenin’s rhyming stanzas in favour of a more free structure that would hopefully convey the casual air of Yesenin’s language. Yesenin’s diction often takes on a colloquial character, and his imagery is bright and occasionally jarring. An example of this is the woman in “You Don’t Love Me,” who is flirty and untouchable and for whom he uses a phrase that has more echoes of a wolf baring its teeth than anything a human could do with their mouth. Despite the overall gentle tone of the poem, the narrator’s bitterness shows through his reserve, and for this reason I decided to leave the animalistic imagery.</p>","<p>Sergei Yesenin (Сергей А. Есенин, 1895–1925) was a Russian Imagist. Yesenin’s reputation as a “peasant prophet” stemmed from his rural upbringing and the fact that he was most inspired by village lifestyle and lore, later accentuated in his poetry by post-revolutionary melancholy. In the words of literary critic Yuri Prokushev, Yesenin’s imagery was “not obscured by religious symbols or vocabulary,” which made him endearing to a huge readership.</p>","<p>Malika Kadyrova graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2015 with a major in comparative literature and minors in French and classical studies.

doloroso.

Zambra has a subtle way of transmitting verse with intimidating simplicity, or better yet, decisiveness, which makes it daunting to translate when trying to stay as faithful to the original as possible. At first, I tried to alternate nouns when talking about a subject more than once, such as with “her feet.” I thought about switching between feet and legs in order to counter the more repetitive nature of the English, considering that in Spanish there is no need to directly imply a person’s gender when talking about him/her. “She tries,” “her feet,” “she looks,” “she stops,” and “she has” could not have been avoided without making the poem suffer. For example, the first line would translate literally into something like: “Tries to feel the floor.” The line uses a gender-neutral pronoun. “It” would be the closest comparison. The penultimate verse in the original, “Y que ella [“she”] mira el mar,” is the only indication of this figure’s gender. After reading the poem many times, a title instantly came to mind: “Under The Custody Of Time.” “Propiedad de la espera” literally translates to “Property Of Waiting,” which I don’t think fully grasps the poem’s meaning. To me, this poem is about how bittersweet it is to look back at our past, or even about how we sometimes feel our lives might be slipping from our hands, how we idly stand in place while the world just keeps turning without us. “Under The Custody Of Time</em>…</p>","<p>Alejandro Zambra is a famous twenty-first-century Chilean poet, short story writer, and novelist.

As a woman translator, I have always found it convenient to assume female authorship unless otherwise specified. I made no exception while reading and rewriting the sonnets of La Compiuta Donzella. Even knowing, as a student of medieval literature, that medieval poets and writers tend toward self-camouflage rather than self-revelation, I persisted in reading her poems autobiographically — or semi-autobiographically, at least.</p>
<p>My translations of La Compiuta Donzella’s sonnets do not follow a literal phrase-by-phrase procedure, nor are they conventionally literary verse renderings. Instead, inspired by Caroline Bergvall’s Chaucerian re-visions in <em>Meddle English</em>, I opted for a sort of poetic archaeology, digging up buried idioms and lost meanings that were once common to the English and Italian vernaculars. At a practical level, this has entailed amplifying key words and abbreviating various others, as well as a certain amount of free association. I hope that parts of these translations will sound familiar to readers of Chaucer’s <em>Canterbury Tales</em>, Malory’s <em>Morte d’Arthur</em>, and anonymous early modern English and Scottish balladry.</p>
<p>The versions of the original texts reproduced here are drawn from Gianfranco Contini’s anthology <em>Poeti del Duecento: Poesia cortese toscana e settentrionale</em> (1960).</p>","<p>If she truly existed, (La) Compiuta Donzella was a thirteenth-century Italian poet who was the first woman to have written poetry in the Italian vernacular. However, some theorize that the poet was simply a creation of male poets, as there are no records of her existence other than her three sonnets. In this piece, she writes about her life and how she was torn between becoming a nun and succumbing to her father’s wishes to marry a man her father had chosen for her.</p>","<p>Samantha Pious is a graduate student in comparative literature and literary theory at the University of Pennsylvania.

fine-untitled,Może być bez tytułu,Fine Untitled,Wisława Szymborska,Monica Wojciechowski,"Doszło do tego, że siedzę pod drzewem,
na brzegu rzeki,
w słoneczny poranek.
Jest to zdarzenie błahe
i do historii nie wejdzie.
To nie bitwy i pakty,
których motywy się bada,
ani godne pamięci zabójstwa tyranów.

A jednak siedzę nad rzeką, to fakt.
I skoro tutaj jestem,
musiałam skądś przyjść,
a przedtem
w wielu jeszcze miejscach się podziewać,
całkiem tak samo jak zdobywcy krain,
nim wstąpili na pokład.

Ma bujna przeszłość chwila nawet ulotna,
swój piątek przed sobotą,
swój przed czerwcem maj.
Ma swoje horyzonty równie rzeczywiste
jak w lornetce dowódców.

To drzewo to topola zakorzeniona od lat.
Rzeka to Raba nie od dziś płynąca.
Ścieżka nie od przedwczoraj
wdeptana w krzakach.
Wiatr, żeby rozwiać chmury,
musiał je wcześniej tu przywiać.

I choć w pobliżu nic się wielkiego nie dzieje,
świat nie jest przez to uboższy w szczegóły,
gorzej uzasadniony, słabiej określony,
niż kiedy zagarniały go wędrówki ludów.

Nie tylko tajnym spiskom towarzyszy cisza.
Nie tylko koronacjom orszak przyczyn.
Potrafią być okrągłe nie tylko rocznice powstań,
ale i obchodzone kamyki na brzegu.

Zawiły jest i gęsty haft okoliczności.
Ścieg mrówki w trawie.
Trawa wszyta w ziemię.
Deseń fali, przez którą przewleka się patyk.

Tak się złożyło, że jestem i patrzę.
Nade mną biały motyl trzepoce w powietrzu
skrzydełkami, co tylko do niego należą
i przelatuje mi przez ręce cień,
nie inny, nie czyjkolwiek, tylko jego własny.

Na taki widok zawsze opuszcza mnie pewność,
że to co ważne
ważniejsze jest od nieważnego.","It’s come to this: I’m sitting under a tree
by a river
on a sunny day.
It’s really no big deal,
and won’t go down in history.
It’s not a battle or accord
whose motives scholars probe,
or the death of a dictator all easily recall.

But still, it’s true, I’m by the river.
And since I’m here,
I must’ve come from somewhere else,
and before that
been in other somewheres still,
just like the sailing conquerors
before setting foot on deck.

A passing moment has an ample past,
its Friday-before-Saturday
its pre-summer May.
Its horizons are just as clear
as the sharpest sniper’s gaze.

This poplar tree’s stood firm for years.
This river — the Raba — didn’t spring just now.
The flattened path through the brush
wasn’t crushed last week.
To clear the sky’s clouds,
wind must’ve earlier blown them here.

And although nothing big’s going on nearby,
the world isn’t any less intricate,
defined, legitimate,
than when wandering swarms roamed its dirt.

Silence doesn’t just shroud muffled mischief.
Songs and strolls don’t just trail grand parades.
Stones from shore can be skipped just the same
as work on a national holiday.

The web of circumstance is tangled and dense.
Stitches of ants woven through grass,
the grass itself sewn tight to the earth.
The shape of a wave traced by each drifting twig.

It just so happened that I am, and I watch.
Above me a white butterfly floats
with a light flap of wings that only he owns,
and a shadow flies across my arm —
not another, not any other’s, but his alone.

At times like these, I’m always less sure
that what’s important
is more important than what’s not.","<p>The title itself is an ironic showcase of Szymborska’s subtle irony and humble disposition.

I also wished to make a few of the images new. Instead of literally translating that the doll’s hat is decorated with a cherry, I chose to say that the doll has a cherry in its dress.

You were so sweet, your heart so open,

The stars are inscrutable, and so is the heart;

My eyes always found yours regardless:
I’d drink in your breaths, tasty poisons,

In any other context, I might’ve found the line a bit too heady, a bit too into itself, but what struck me was that someone had quoted the line to express (directly) to a loved one the sentiments contained in it. I couldn’t get that interaction out of my head for days, and so my own translation began with (and centers on) this particular line.</p>
<p>The line “we often told each other imperishable things” is very close to the original French, but I took certain liberties with the rest of the translation. I tried to hew close to (what I feel) is the character of the love the poem describes — it’s by no means a singular, once-in-a-lifetime love, but it’s a love that manages to be as earthy as it is sweet — many translations lose sight of its earthiness — and despite its transience, it’s one worth remembering. This necessitated the use of certain phrases that have a more animalistic connotation in English (for example, “smelled your blood” and “tasty poisons”) than they do in the original, and a switch from the passive to the active voice in two stanzas that emphasizes the fact that the lovers are entirely separate beings who <em>choose</em> to come together on this balcony.</p>","<p>Charles Baudelaire was born in 1821 in Paris. Often referred to as a <em>poéte maudit</em>, a “cursed poet,” Baudelaire was known for his work in translating Edgar Allan Poe’s poetry from English to French as well as for his originality in style. He is credited with coining the term “modernity” to refer to the fleeting quality of life in an urban city, and believed that art must capture those sentiments. His most famous work is <em>Les fleurs du mal</em> (<em>The Flowers of Evil</em>), a collection of French poetry that led to his prosecution for indecency and religious immorality due to references to the devil as well as the principle themes of sex and death. However, Baudelaire’s perseverance lead to the collection being recognized as revolutionary, and it stands among the most famous collections of French poetry today. Baudelaire’s skills as a poet, prose author and translator have garnered him much fame and respect, and though he is not as well known as other French contemporaries of his time, he has most certainly earned his place in the scope of global literature.</p>",<p>Shilpa Saravanan is a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania studying linguistics and computer science.

« Pourquoi es tu larron en mer? »
L’autre response luy donna:
« Pourquoi larron me faiz nommer?
Pour ce qu’on me voit escumer
En une petiote fuste?
Se comme toy me peusse armer,
Comme toy empereur je fusse.

« Mais que veux-tu? De ma fortune,
Contre qui ne puis bonnement,
Qui si faulcement me fortune,
Me vient tout ce gouvernement.
Excuse moy aucunement
Et saiche qu’en grant povreté
(Ce mot se dit communement),
Ne gist pas grande loyauté. »

Quant l’empereur ot remiré
De Diomedès tout le dit :
« Ta fortune je te mueray
Mauvaise en bonne », si luy dit.
Si fist il. Onc puis ne mesdit
A personne, mais fut vray homme;
Valere pour vray le baudit,
Qui fut nommé le Grant a Rome.","During Alexander’s reign,
the man they called Diomedes
was brought before him, all in chains,
from toes to fingers, as a thief,
for he was of the outlaw band
whose raids we’ve seen go sailing by.
Before the captain he was brought
to be condemned to die.

The emperor approached him: “Why
are you a pirate on the sea?”
The other gave him this reply:
“Why do you call it piracy?
Because we skim along the coast,
my little sailboat and my crew?
Had I a navy armed like yours,
then I were emperor like you.

“But what do you care? Lady Luck,
against whom no good ship can steer,
she’s luffed me over in this muck!
Her government has brought me here. 
Excuse my French, since you must know
that men in desperate poverty
— these words are in the Pirates’ Code —
we can’t afford great loyalty.”

But when the emperor had heard
Diomedes, why then, instead —
“I’ll change your luck from bad to good,”
the leader said. And so he did.
He never spoke an evil word,
more faithful man was never known,
and (from Valerius) we learn
that he was named the Great in Rome. ","<p>In these verses, the fabled confrontation between the pirate captain Diomedes and the legendary emperor Alexander the Great attests to a basic equivalence between government and criminal, tyrant and terrorist, revolutionary and traitor. The last line of the third stanza is of course sardonic, and the syntactic slippage between Alexander and Diomedes in the final stanza is deliberate. The title “Pirate King” may refer to Diomedes, Alexander, or both at once.</p>","<p>François Villon (1431–1463?), poet, student, and outlaw, composed the translated verses in prison as part of his <em>Testament</em>, a poetic riff on the legal convention of a last will. Born into poverty, he was adopted and raised by a chaplain and future professor of canon law at the University of Paris, where he would receive a bachelor’s degree in 1449 and a master’s in 1452.</p>
<p>Villon’s first run-in with the law occurred in 1455, when he was arrested for assaulting a priest in a brawl; the following year, he helped to orchestrate the theft of five hundred gold crowns from the College of Navarre. His first major work, <em>Le lais</em> (<em>The Legacy</em>), a poetic last will that prefigures the longer <em>Testament</em>, dates from around the time of this robbery. Over the next few years, during his first exile from Paris, he may have found a literary patron and legal protector in Duke Charles of Orléans, whose personal album contains three of Villon’s shorter poems.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1461, Villon was imprisoned once again, this time at Meung-sur-Loire, where he composed the <em>Testament</em> before being liberated, along with many other prisoners, as part of a display of royal munificence by King Louis XI on his travels through the provinces. Villon’s final arrest occurred in Paris, in 1462. Condemned to hang, he appealed and was granted a commuted sentence of ten years’ banishment from the city. After January 1463, no further trace of him remained.</p>","<p>Samantha Pious is a graduate student in comparative literature and literary theory at the University of Pennsylvania.

The day you shot your first bird dead,
the sound of its song grew.
It started out a whistle, whispering through
leaves caught by your arrow’s test,
but then it rose into your breast
and ripped a hole between
what you had understood to mean
our world removed from history
and you, or where you should be.
The birdsong hardened to a stone
and found a place among your bones
to nest and bite with each new shot
at feathered wings until a spot
of brilliant red on trampled green
— a side of death you’d never seen —
was just enough to newly tear
that hole between small lungs and air.
You ran to me with tear-stained eyes,
a child unable to say why
the silence of a bird’s sweet song
had opened your heart to a world of wrong.
 
One day I saw you rent your hair
— my child who had never a care —
and watching how the magpie drew
into your chest, I quickly knew
the birds that day would have to die
to keep your thoughts turned from the sky.
The curse of blood, your father’s art,
had somehow found your weakest part.
My darling son, I pulled you near,
and leaves like lips unfolded fear.
I ordered men to find and snatch
from trees all birds that they could catch,
but of those birds remained a few
whose whistles brought that curse anew.
The touch of roses on your skin
had faded to a dew so thin,
As each bird’s death became a fief,
you asked: “What have birds done for strife?”
 
I kissed you on the mouth and said:
“It’s not through me that birds fall dead,
but surely through the highest god.
How could I walk where he has trod?”
That small word pulled your chest abroad:
“Ôwe, Mother, what is god?”
“Sweet Parzival, I truly say,
that god is lighter than the day,
his countenance made to reflect
the good in man you would expect.
For you may turn in times of need
to he whose greatest loyalty
extends to all found in distress,
so long as faith is not suppressed.
There roams another — lord of hell —
whose loyalty in darkness fell.
Away from him turn all your thoughts,
especially when they are caught
in blinding doubt’s inconstancies.”
 
Remember how we lived at ease.","<p>Completed around 1210 and now regarded as one of the great German epics of its time, <em>Parzival</em> was introduced to a German audience that had already read about Arthurian romance and chivalry. But Parzival is a somewhat alternative knight. This translation is roughly a third of a longer, researched piece that I adapted from Book III of <em>Parzival</em>. My research drew from the conversation between Parzival and his mother, Herzeloyde, which introduces von Eschenbach’s interest in Parzival’s humanity and the place of religion in his story, both of which set <em>Parzival</em> apart from the standard courtly ideals and characters of Arthuriana. Throughout the narrative, Parzival returns to his childhood questions about his own relationship both to God and the rest of humanity. Upon her husband Gahmuret’s death in battle, Herzeloyde decides to move with Parzival and their servants to the forest, in order to shield Parzival from knighthood; no one is allowed to speak the word “knight” or mention King Arthur. My translation is written in von Eschenbach’s style of rhyming couplets, but I chose to adapt this section from a third-person narrative to Herzeloyde’s first person perspective as a way of exploring the character transformations of both Herzeloyde and Parzival. I took license with the reordering of translated lines and emphasis on certain narrative aspects as a means of staying true to the new Herzeloyde perspective.</p>","<p>All that we know of Wolfram von Eschenbach (1160/80–1220) comes from his poetry. While there are no extant historical documents that mention Wolfram, he does refer to himself in his work as a knight, a poet with many patrons, and even an illiterate writer. Based on the dialects of his written works and their geographical references, present-day Bavaria has been designated as Wolfram’s birthplace. Wolfram composed the narrative works <em>Parzival</em>, <em>Titurel</em>, and <em>Willehalm</em>, in addition to lyric poetry.</p>",<p>Michaela Kotziers is a senior in the College majoring in English literature with concentrations in creative writing and medieval studies.</p>,German,de,../assets/images/images_16/eschenbach.JPG,,photo by a <em>DoubleSpeak</em> staffer,,,,2016,submission

The fact that two of us speak Korean was helpful, of course, but even those of us with no knowledge of the language felt strongly about each choice. There were often moments when those who spoke Korean felt that the others’ translations were not close enough to the original, and so it became a tug-of-war between staying true to the original and trying to convey the sense of resignation that we all were wrestling with. There were times when feelings won, such as the choice to translate with minimal punctuation or capitalization — though the original has periods that lend it a sense of finality, we all felt that this love story was unfinished, and so we chose to not use any punctuation aside from the occasional comma. Other times, we stayed true to the original. Our decision to rhyme the last line of every stanza came from the rhyming and melodic sounds in the Korean. Though this made our translation process more difficult, we were all very pleased with the results. Poetry is perhaps the most universal and yet the most intimate form of language. This paradox (or this serendipity) emerged at each step of our process.</p>","<p>Kim Sowol (<span lang=""ko"">김소월</span>) was a famous early modern poet from Northern Korea, when Korea was not yet divided. He is best known for his collection <em>The Azaleas</em>, which was published in 1925 when Kim was twenty-five years old. He was most adored for incorporating Korean folk rhythms into his poetry, as these rhythms touched the hearts of his audience. They also create an additional challenge for translators of his work.

Ora m’insegnerà altre misure

che quanto è da salvare si salverà.","Leave me with my death.  
She will confess those words in D minor,
those words that do not demand your dictionaries.
Those words of love uncharted 
even by Petrarch,
uttered where love is ethereal gold,
unfit to hug the curve of a mortal wrist.
 
Death and I speak as old friends.
She has been here from my first breath,
my ally in work and play.
Her arms have held 
the same hearts as mine.
A reckless eagle, 
intoxicated by azure,
she has shown me 
the true size of humanity.
 
Today she will show me other scales,
scales I vainly questioned;
Caught in the cage of my six senses,
my head thuds against the bars.
Sorrow finds me as I part from my daughter, 
my art not yet done.
But tossing her head back, 
Death soothes my fears. Promises:
<em>I will save whatever is left to be saved.</em>
","<p>Translating “Testament” was a monumental task because of Spaziani’s musicality. Though I do not speak Italian, simply hearing the Italian and seeing it on the page was enough for me to know that I had to make sound a priority. At first, this awareness made my translation stray very far from the Italian. My work breached a line between translation and what Professor Suvir Kaul called transcreation, and I wasn’t comfortable with that breach. I wanted, rather, to honor Spaziani, whose reputation might be overshadowed by male Italian poets like Eugenio Montale and Giuseppe Ungaretti, although she was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature three times. So I returned to the Italian (with the help of those who speak it and a number of Italian dictionaries) and rewrote many of the lines until I reached the translation you see. Still this translation does not parallel Spaziani’s poem in terms of lyricality, but I hope it is a testament (pun intended) to her brilliance.</p>","<p>Maria Luisa Spaziani was born in 1923 in Turin, Italy, and she died in 2014. At nineteen years old, she was the director of a small literary magazine, <em>Il dado</em>; her work there led to relationships with internationally renowned writers such as Virginia Woolf. A translator and scholar of French and German literature as well as a prolific poet, Spaziani incorporated motifs of the natural world into her sense of a long and thoughtfully inherited literary tradition. A longtime collaborator with the poet Eugenio Montale, Spaziani served as president of the Centro Internazionale Eugenio Montale. She published over seventeen acclaimed books of poetry and she translated writers such as Pierre de Ronsard, Marguerite Yourcenar, Jean Racine, André Gide, Francis Jammes, and Gustave Flaubert.

È quasi sicuro che questa
è la mia ultima poesia in friulano:
e voglio parlare a un fascista,
prima che io, o lui, siamo troppo lontani.

È un fascista giovane,
avrà ventuno, ventidue anni:
è nato in un paese
ed è andato a scuola in città.

È alto, con gli occhiali, il vestito
grigio, i capelli corti:
quando comincia a parlarmi,
penso che non sappia niente di politica

e che cerchi solo di difendere il latino
e il greco contro di me; non sapendo
quanto io ami il latino, il greco — e i capelli corti.
Lo guardo, è alto e grigio come un alpino.

“Vieni qua, vieni qua, Fedro.
Ascolta. Voglio farti un discorso
che sembra un testamento.
Ma ricordati, io non mi faccio illusioni

su di te: io so, io so bene,
che tu non hai, e non vuoi averlo,
un cuore libero, e non puoi essere sincero:
ma anche se sei un morto, io ti parlerò.

Difendi i paletti di gelso, di ontano,
in nome degli Dei, greci o cinesi.
Muori d’amore per le vigne.
Per i fichi negli orti. I ceppi, gli stecchi.

Per il capo tosato dei tuoi compagni.
Difendi i campi tra il paese
e la campagna, con le loro pannocchie
abbandonate. Difendi il prato

tra l’ultima casa del paese e la roggia.
I casali assomigliano a Chiese:
godi di questa idea, tienla nel cuore.
La confidenza col sole e con la pioggia,

lo sai, è sapienza sacra.
Difendi, conserva, prega! La Repubblica
è dentro, nel corpo della madre.
I padri hanno cercato e tornato a cercar

di qua e di là, nascendo, morendo,
cambiando: ma son tutte cose del passato.
Oggi: difendere, conservare, pregare. Taci!
Che la tua camicia non sia

nera, e neanche bruna. Taci! che sia
una camicia grigia. La camicia del sonno.
Odia quelli che vogliono svegliarsi,
e dimenticarsi delle Pasque...

Dunque, ragazzo dai calzetti di morto,
ti ho detto ciò che vogliono gli Dei
dei campi. Là dove sei nato.
Là dove da bambino hai imparato 

i loro Comandamenti. Ma in Città?
Là Cristo non basta.
Occorre la Chiesa: ma che sia
moderna. E occorrono i poveri

Tu difendi, conserva, prega:
ma ama i poveri: ama la loro diversità.
Ama la loro voglia di vivere soli
nel loro mondo, tra prati e palazzi

dove non arrivi la parola
del nostro mondo; ama il confine
che hanno segnato tra noi e loro;
ama il loro dialetto inventato ogni mattina,

per non farsi capire; per non condividere
con nessuno la loro allegria.
Ama il sole di città e la miseria
dei ladri; ama la carne della mamma nel figlio

Dentro il nostro mondo, dì
di non essere borghese, ma un santo
o un soldato: un santo senza ignoranza,
o un soldato senza violenza.

Porta con mani di santo o soldato
l’intimità col Re, Destra divina
che è dentro di noi, nel sonno.
Credi nel borghese cieco di onestà,

anche se è un’illusione: perché
anche i padroni hanno
i loro padroni, e sono figli di padri
che stanno da qualche parte nel mondo.

È sufficiente che solo il sentimento
della vita sia per tutti uguale:
il resto non importa, giovane con in mano
il Libro senza la Parola.

Hic desinit cantus. Prenditi
tu, sulle spalle, questo fardello.
Io non posso: nessuno ne capirebbe
lo scandalo. Un vecchio ha rispetto

del giudizio del mondo: anche
se non gliene importa niente. E ha rispetto
di ciò che egli è nel mondo. Deve
difendere i suoi nervi, indeboliti,

e stare al gioco a cui non è mai stato.
Prenditi tu questo peso, ragazzo che mi odii:
portalo tu. Risplende nel cuore. E io camminerò
leggero, andando avanti, scegliendo per sempre

la vita, la gioventù.”


","Almost for sure this
is my last piece in <em>Furlàn</em>
and it’s a fascist I’m talking to,
before we get too far.

He is a young fascist,
twenty-one, twenty-two perhaps:
born in the countryside,
schooled in the city.

He is tall, bespectacled, dressed
in gray, short-haired:
when he addresses me I think
he knows nothing on politics 

and only tries to defend Latin
and Greek against me; 
for he doesn’t know
how much I do love Latin, 
I do love Greek — and hair cut short.
I look at him, 
he is tall and grey as an <em>alpìn</em>.

“Here, come here, Fedro.
Hear me. My speech to you here
is like a testament.
But beware, I bear no illusions

on you: I know, I know too well,
that you don’t have, nor wish for,
a free heart, that you can’t be sincere:
but though you’re dead, I’ll speak.

Defend the mulberry pickets, the alder,
in the name of the Gods, 
Greek or Chinese.
Die for your love of vineyards.
For the orchards’ fig trees. 
For the stakes, the poles.

For your comrades’ shaved heads.
Defend the fields between town
and countryside, 
with their abandoned
cobs. Defend the meadow

between the town house and the canal.
Farmsteads are Church-like:
relish this idea, keep it to heart.
Confidence with sun and shower,

you know, is holy knowledge.
Defend, conserve, prey! 
The Republic
lives within, in the mother’s womb.
Fathers have searched and have come back searching,

here and there, between birth and death,
changing: but all this has passed.
Today: defend, protect, pray. Quiet!
May your shirt be

neither black, nor brown. Quiet! Shall it be
grey. A nightshirt.
Hate him who wants to wake up,
and to forget the Easters…

Now, dead-dressed young man,
I spoke to you for the Gods
of the fields. There, where you were born.
There, where you have learned

their Commandments. But in the City?
There Christ is not enough.
You need the Church: 
but it shall be
modern. And you need the poor.

You must defend, conserve, prey:
love the poor, though, love their diversity.
Love their loneliness
in this world, between fields and buildings

where no word arrives
of our world; love the border
they set between us and them;
love the dialect they invent every morning,

not to be understood; not to share
their happiness with anyone.
Love the city’s sun and the misery
of thieves; 
love the mother’s flesh in the child.

In this world of ours, speak out
not as a bourgeois, but as saint
or soldier: a saint without ignorance,
a soldier without violence.

Carry with saint’s or soldier’s hand
the intimacy with the King, a Right divine
which dwells within us, in sleep.
Believe in the blind-honest bourgeois,

even though he is an illusion: for
masters do have
their masters too, and they are sons 
whose fathers
are somewhere, out there.

It’s enough that this life’s
feeling is for all of us the same:
nothing else matters, young man holding
the Book of no Word in your hand.

<em>Hic desinit cantus</em>. Here,
take this weight on your shoulders.
I can’t: nobody would understand
the scandal. An old man reveres

this world’s judgement, though
he doesn’t care. An old man reveres
what he is in this world. He must
defend his nerves, worn-out,

play along the game he never played.
Take this burden, 
young man who hates me:
carry it with you. 
It will shine through your heart. I’ll lightly
walk, going forward, always choosing

life and youth.","<p>This piece by Pier Paolo Pasolini is meant as a dialogical testament, written in Friuli’s dialect and Italian both. It addresses a young fascist of the seventies, who may have appeared as the “natural enemy” of a gay and — at least nominally — communist poet. The poem asks this young fascist to undertake a deeper reactionary/conservative mission than fascism. To “defend, conserve, pray.” For — as far as my interpretation can go — the young fascist shares the distaste of modernity of Pasolini, and so may better understand the poet’s message than the leftist (and modernity enthusiast) youth.</p>
 <p>In my translation I have tried to be as literal as possible and, when English words fell short, I choose to use the dialect version’s words. This happened only twice, with the name of Friuli’s dialect, <em>Furlàn</em>, instead of “friulano”; and with the name of the Italian alpine infantry regiment, <em>alpìn</em>, instead of “alpino.” Furthermore, I decided not to translate a brief Latin phrase that appears in the text: <em>hic desinit cantus</em>, which roughly translates to “here the song ends.” I here present my English translation, and the original text, in dialect and Italian both.</p>
 <p>I am neither an Italian literature scholar, nor a particular expert in Pasolini’s work. What I write, I write as a person who loves to read and to think about what he reads. Who is fascinated by the different directions where his readings, interacting with reality, bring him to. I claim no authority. I choose this piece because I find in it the perfect summary of what puzzles me in Western conservatism.</p>
 <p>To use the words of another great reactionary, Nicolás Gómez Dávila, I feel that conservatism shall be summed up as the “slow and steadfast pace of the soul.” A slow and steadfast pace that may come — I believe — only from some sort of inner tranquillity, of peace with reality. Though, most of Western conservatism, being at odds with modernity, directs its “love of vineyards” out of this world, soiling it with spitefulness. If conservatism grows out of rejection, how does it differ from revolution? Extreme regress is very similar to extreme progress, at the end, and neither of them go with inner tranquillity.</p>
 <p>So here it is, this poem is perfect in pointing to a sentiment that I believe we should direct on other objects. The day we will feel the love of vineyards for the airports connecting our vast world; the day skyscrapers will have in our eyes a bit of the enchantment of castles; the day we will notice that we live in the new Ancien Régime, and that the duty to protect it is on us. That day an healthy conservatism will be born. I would love to be there when we will feel so, and I would love to read the poetry we would thus write.</p>","<p>Pier Paolo Pasolini was born in 1922 in Bologna, Italy. He is known for being a poet and film director. His first book of poems, <em>Poesie a Casarsa</em>, was published in Friulian, the native dialect of his mother. He was overtly left politically and drew heavily from Marxist thinking in his writing and films. In both of these mediums, Pasolini tried to bind Marxist thinking with Catholicism. He published over ten collections of poetry and won the Viareggio Prize for his collection <em>Le Ceneri di Gramsci<em>. He was murdered in 1975, the motives for which are under speculation, particularly in light of his political activism.</p>","<p>I am an Italian PhD student in Economics. I have been trained in such topic in Rome, Turin, and then here at the University of Pennsylvania. My work mostly focuses on how the real and banking/financial sectors interact. Having always been convinced that excessive specialization is boring, I try my best to also put some effort in literature and political thought. In these fields I am just an happy amateur and an avid reader. As such, I got most of my recent amateurish fun from thinking about conservatism in arts and politics.</p>","Friulian, Italian",it,,,,,,,2016,submission
