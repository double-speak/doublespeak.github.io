égorge son spectre
et se lève dans son sang

tout commencement 
dessine un cercle
la mémoire mène 
à la mer des commencements
la jetée est de pierre l’arbre d’exil
j’aspire à l’horizon

sur un fil de lumière
je vais vers ce lieu qui est toi
et ce qui fut advient

une étoile danse sur 
le ciel de mon front
l’oiseau en nous renaît 
de la rive de l’âme
ta parole est tienne 
mienne est ma parole

tu rejoins le lieu que je suis
et le poème continue de s’écrire

je vois ton visage et 
l’ombre sur ton visage
comme le poème 
la souffrance se partage
nous compatissons 
à l’arbre aux saisons
trop brèves et 
à l’exil des saisons
aux sourires et aux 
déchirements de la terre
aux malheurs des hommes 
aux prières des femmes

à nos voeux l’instant prend 
sa forme éblouie
le temps s’efface 
tel un paysage
nous vivons les 
deux moitiés de nos vies
comme un voyage qui 
se souviendrait peut-être
du nom des îles 
des oiseaux des ports
du sillage blanc 
des navires des villes des êtres
du cycle des arrivées et des départs

et nous tombons 
amoureux de la nuit
parce que chaque nuit 
célèbre les noces du rêve
et nous tombons 
amoureux du jour
parce que la vie 
commence avec chaque jour
","each day the sun slits 
the throat of its former self
and rises in its blood

each beginning 
represents a circle
a memory leads 
to a sea of possibilities
a pier is made of rock 
a tree of exile
i yearn for the horizon

on a thread of light
i proceed towards 
this place that is you
and what was begins again

a star dances on the sky 
that is my forehead
the bird within us is reborn 
from the nest of our soul
your word is yours mine is my own

you return to the place that I am
and the poem begins to write itself

i see your face and 
the shadow on your face
like a poem your suffering is shared
we share the grief of a withering tree
too brief and at the mercy of the seasons
of the smiles and of the rifts of the earth
of men’s misfortunes of women’s prayers

with our wishes a moment takes 
its dazzled form
time fades like a landscape
we live the two halves of our lives
as if on a journey we perhaps remember
the name of islands of birds of ports
of the white wake of boats of cities of beings
of the cycle of arrivals and of departures

and we fall in love with the night
because each night celebrates 
a dream’s wedding
and we fall in love with the day
because life begins with each day
","<p>I have loved the poems of Amina Saïd since I discovered her during my first year of college three years ago. Her rawness and directness comfort me; she employs common language and a lack of punctuation, which enable the reader to grapple directly with each word on the page. This poem is one of my absolute favorites, for it is easy to fall in love with the first line; the evocative imagery jumps out at the reader, forcing her to come to terms with a violent, self-destructive sun and its rebirth after tragedy each day. This concept forces us to consider the essence of life, of our own regeneration with the coming and going of each day. I chose to translate <i>égorge son spectre</i> as “slits the throat of its former self” instead of “slits the throat of its ghost” in order to convey a sense of rebirth and  regeneration of the sun as its own entity or “former self.” I wanted to delineate the poem’s first line, which also serves as its title, as evocative of the essence of a phoenix being reborn from ashes, and therefore believe the indication of “former self” is necessary in order to distinguish between a sense of the past and of the present.</p>
<p> With the line “each beginning represents a circle,” I chose to translate the French <em>dessine</em> (“to draw”) in a more symbolic manner in order to underscore the symbolism of a circle as representative of a beginning or of this feeling of rebirth that the first line of the poem conveys. In this manner, I chose the word “possibilities” in lieu of “beginnings” for the French <em>commencements</em> in the following line to emphasize the sense of possibility that is enabled through rebirth, which inherently constitutes a new beginning.</p>
<p> Saïd shirks off any usage of punctuation or capitalization; it seems that in some portions of the poem, particularly “and what was begins again,” might be better clarified by punctuation. However, I find the beauty in Saïd’s poetry to underscore an ephemerality rooted within words and a constancy lodged within uncertainty. Saïd seems to be telling us that poetry and therefore life cannot be fully understood through generic formulas of punctuation, but rather through endeavoring to unravel the deeper meaning within a collection of words themselves.</p>
<p>I felt calm when reading the second to last stanza, for I find solace in the repetition of the French word <em>de</em> (“of”) for this repetition suggests the struggle of remembrance, of attempting to uncover past memories which are so inextricably tied to the present and the future that the lines of distinction are blurred. This repetition also mimics Saïd’s signature rambling style, forcing the reader to consider the poem as a stream of consciousness that can apply to any person’s experience of life and of the trials and tribulations involved with love, darkness, and light.</p>
<p>Saïd juxtaposes notions of “you” with “me” in order to more fully arrive at the idea of an intertwining of souls, yet I believe that the beauty of this poem is more so discovered by ascertaining the connection of the individual self (or selves) with nature. By noting that “we fall in love with the night” and “we fall in love with the day,” she avails us to the beauty of life and the evocations of lightness and darkness imbued within it.</p>","<p>Born in Tunis in 1953, Amina Saïd was raised bilingual, learning both Arabic and French in school and speaking Arabic, the language of her parents, at home. After being encouraged by her teacher, she began to write poetry in middle school and soon became enamored with the power of the written word to relate essential truths of being. She studied English in college and started to publish poetry soon after graduation. Saïd made a living as a journalist in France but continued to write throughout her life, ultimately publishing her work in numerous poetry collections and being considered as a unique voice based on her Tunisian heritage and experimentation with form.</p>","<p>Ashley Sniffen is a junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying art history and French and Francophone studies. Passionate about art, language, and education, she enjoys staring at the paintings hanging on white walls of museums and creating events that support artists and cultural institutions. In her spare time, she enjoys reading, basking in nature, and watching college basketball games.</p>",French,fr,,,"<div>

A Chain Verse 

Outside, enjoying the flowers, then coming back
on a horse, running, running, almost flying.
The sprightly horse seems like it’s flying;
the impact of the wine 
is fading. My drunken
fog is clearing; 
the hour 
is already 
late.
When
 I woke, 
it was already dusk,
and I’ve come back from enjoying the flowers. 
","<p>The original poem, an example of chain verses (<span lang= ""zh"">连环诗</span>) in ancient Chinese, is only fourteen characters long. This form of verse (<span lang= ""zh"">七言绝句</span>) is often twenty-eight characters long, with each line having seven characters. In this chain verse, the last three or four characters of each line are repeated in the next line, so the resulting poem requires only fourteen distinct characters. One fascinating feature of this poem is that in each line, the repeated characters often change parts of speech, slightly altering the meaning. For example, in the line “the impact of the wine is fading,” the original word for “fading” means “becoming slight” (<span lang= ""zh"">微</span>), and in the next line, this word becomes an adverb (here translated as ""slightly”) that modifies the verb “waking” (<span lang= ""zh"">醒</span>), which we’ve translated in this context as “clearing.” For the shape, we couldn’t get it to form a diamond as in the original due to the wordiness of English, so we formed it into an ancient Chinese wine goblet (<span lang= ""zh"">觚</span>, <em>gu</em>), hoping to convey some of the meaning of the poem through the form.</p>","<p>The author is alleged to be <span lang= ""zh"">苏轼</span>, Su Shi, but this remains unconfirmed. Su Shi was a Chinese calligrapher, essayist, gastronomer, pharmacologist, poet, politician, and travel writer during the Song dynasty.</p>","<p>Gil Lehmann and Jacey Chang are both Masters of City Planning students in the Weitzman School of Design.

shapes-in-sleep-eight-poems,Schlafgestalten: acht Gedichte,Shapes in Sleep: Eight Poems,Paul Celan,David Ting,"AUGENBLICKE, wessen Winke, 
keine Helle schläft. 
Unentworden, allerorten, 
sammle dich, 
steh. 



Deine Hände, die unermüdlichen Jäger. Gott 
ist vergessen, sie greifen die Beute, du lebst. 
Eine Stunde, diese, 
bläst dir den Namen leer. 



IN DIE NACHT GEGANGEN, helferisch 
ein stern-
durchlässiges Blatt 
statt des Mundes: 

es bleibt 
noch etwas wild zu vertun, 
bäumlings.



Ein Dritter steht neben uns, 
er spricht unsre Sprache, 
er spricht sie besser als wir, 
tödlicher, rauschender, heller. 



KOMM, wir löffeln 
Nervenzellen 
- die Entengrütze, multipolar, 
der leergeleuchteten Teiche — 
aus den 
Rauten-
gruben. 

Zehn Fasern ziehn 
aus den noch erreichbaren Zentren 
Halberkennbares nach. 




SCHNEEPART, gebäumt, bis zuletzt, 
im Aufwind, vor 
den für immer entfensterten 
Hütten: 

Flachträume schirken 
übers 
geriffelte Eis; 

die Wortschatten 
heraushaun, sie klaftern 
rings um den Krampen 
im Kolk.




Kleine Silbe, kurze Heimat, 
in der du dich eingeheimnißt verlierst, 

der Eine, Viele, 
der Nachbar 
im beseelten Kristall 
fügt dir zehn Tage Nachwahn 
zu. 




Alle die Schlafgestalten, kristallin, 
die du annahmst 
im Sprachschatten, 

ihnen 
führ ich mein Blut zu, 

die Bildzeilen, sie 
soll ich bergen 
in den Schlitzvenen 
meiner Erkenntnis -, 

meine Trauer, ich seh’s, 
läuft zu dir über.
","MOMENTS, filled with omens,
never shut your eyes.
Undecaying, from all places,
gather yourself,
rise.



Your hands, these inexhaustible hunters. God
is forgotten, they reach into the hive. You survive.
An hour, this one,
blesses you with the name.



INTO THE NIGHT, a volunteer
leaf
shivering with starlight, gone,
instead of the mouth:

it remains
something savagely wasted,
by the saplings.



A third being stands near us,
he speaks our language,
he speaks it better than we can:
deadlier, quieter, brighter.



COME, we are spooning out
neurons
— like duck porridge, multipolar,
from the unlit pond —
out of the
brain-
stem.

Ten tendons weed out
what is still within reach.
Half-recognizable.




SNOW. INSOMNIA. Branching to no end,
in the updraft, before
the forever window-gouged
huts:

spindrift of dreams
over
riffled ice;

to carve words
out of shadows, tether them
around the pickaxe
in the echo.




Small syllable, brief homeland,
secret instant where you spirit yourself —

the One, the Many,
the neighbor
in animate crystal:
they possess you, ten days, all
nightmare.




All the shapes in sleep, crystalline,
transmitted to you
by voices in the dark,

I
lure them with my blood,

rows of images
burgeon, transfuse
through slit veins,
into what I know —

I mourn.
It infects you.
","<p>A narrative binds these eight poems. Paul Celan’s lifelong subject: the presence of evil. The transitions between these poems are as important as what each poem contains. In order: a dead thing resurrects itself; a set of hands remembers its owner; a loved one vanishes; a sinister stranger appears; a skull is opened; a worksite remains haunted; someone is possessed; the reader is acquainted with grief. Allow the other voices to emerge.</p>
<p>I have carefully selected these poems from four of his later volumes (<em>Fadensonnen</em>, <em>Lichtzwang</em>, <em>Schneepart</em>, <em> Zeitgehöft</em>), and his uncollected work, which is rarely translated into English. His work is shot through with allusions, metaphors, distorted grammar, specialized vocabulary. His poems operate like Trojan horses. In English, I cautiously open the trapdoor.</p>
<p><b>“Augenblicke”/“Moments”</b> — Invocation of the dead, but also of the self. The poem revolves around the word for “moments”: <em>Augen</em> +  <em>Blicke</em> (“eye” + “glances”). Celan puns on the image of an eye with <em>Winke</em> (plural), which is not a “wink” but “a sign, a hint.” <em>Augenblicke</em> to <em>Winke</em>: for English, I reimagine this as the decay from “moments” to the word “omen” hidden within. I retain the assonance of <em>schläft</em>/<em>steh</em> in “eyes”/“rise.” <em>Fadensonnen</em> (1968).</p>
<p><b>“Deine Hände, die”/“Your hands, these”</b> — The brief moment, during the creative act, when one forgets that they are writing anything. Uncollected (1958).</p>
<p><b>“In die Nacht gegangen”/“Into the night”</b> — Records a deportation, and the ingratitude of the new generation. Punning on “leaf” as a page, as a missing part of a family tree. The mouth left behind: Celan’s. But what is wasted? Celan’s voice, or the person missing? <em>Lichtzwang</em> (1970).</p>
<p><b>“Ein Dritter steht neben uns”/“A third being stands near us”</b> — An uncanny presence. Is it welcome? Uncollected (circa 1957).</p>
<p><b>“Komm”/“Come”</b> — An autopsy. A telepathic excavation of the last experiences of the dead. Ten fingers dredging fibrous neurons out of a skull. <em>Rauten-</em>/<em>grüben</em> is the rhomboid fossa, a specific structure deep in the brainstem. <em>Raute</em> also refers to a bitter herb called rue, or ruewort. During the Renaissance it was believed to improve eyesight when consumed. See <em>Paradise Lost</em> (11.413–428) where the Archangel Michael “purged with euphrasy and rue / The visual nerve” of Adam; this divine concoction opens Adam’s eyes to the depths of his Original Sin, thoroughly clarifying his vision, “even to the inmost seat of mental sight.” <em>Fadensonnen</em> (1968).</p>
<p><b>“Schneepart”/“Snow. Insomnia.”</b> — Another excavation: recapturing a forgotten dream. Strain of locating the words for it, after awakening. <em>Schneepart</em> (1971).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Schnee</em> + <em>Part</em>: Not a portion or piece, this “Snowpart,” but how one plays a part, a role — plays dead. <em>Schnee</em>, snow, white, resembles the whitest, purest crematorium ash.</li>
<li><em>gebäumt</em>: in a shape like a tree, the snowfall, falling ash: a family tree. In front of huts with broken windows. Houses with damaged eyes. Again, the scene of a deportation.</li>
<li>“Snow. Insomnia.” to capture the mood. But I also pay homage to Osip Mandelstam’s “Schlaflosigkeit. Homer.” after Celan’s own German translation of his favorite poet. Nadezhda Mandelstam, Osip’s widow, upon reading Celan’s translations, indicated in a postcard to Celan dated July 12, 1962, that Celan had not performed this literally but had movingly transposed her husband’s Russian. In that faith, I transform Celan back into Mandelstam.</li>
<li><em>Flachtraume schirken</em>=“flat-dreams” skipping like stones over frozen water. My translation is a different moment. “Spindrift”: the trace of debris in the wind such skipping leaves behind.</li>
<li><em>heraushauen</em>: a verb for gathering firewood. The implication: words can be set alight.</li>
<li><em>Kolk</em>: a bog pond, but also a vortex. A synonym for <em>Kolk </em>(“bog pond”) is <em>Moorauge</em>: “moor” + “eye.” A complement to the shattered “eyes” of the huts. Abstracting all of these resonances, this version keeps a pronunciation: the long “o” sound found in both <em>Kolk</em> and <em>echo</em>. An “o”: a shape whose circle suggests an open mouth, as well as an open eye.</li></ul>
<p><b>“Kleine Silbe”/“Small syllable”</b> — What it can be like to read Celan: intense reflection on a single word, as if it were a crystal. The neologism <em>Nachwahn</em> (“ensuing madness”) shares the prefix <em>Nach-</em> (“to,” “after”) with <em>Nachbar</em> (“neighbor”). I keep the alliteration. Close to <em>Nachwahn</em> is <em>Nachwahl</em>: a postponed election. Uncollected (1969).</p>
<p><b>“Alle die Schlafgestalten, kristallin”/“All the shapes in sleep, crystalline”</b> — Psychic intervention, or revenge. A translingual rhyme between lure and <em>führ</em>, root verb for Hitler’s title, <em>der Führer</em> (“the Leader”). I readjust <em>bergen</em> (“to rescue”) to “burgeon” (“to flourish”), as a play on their deceptive similarities in spelling, pronunciation, and meaning. In light of Celan’s lifelong guilt, and his eventual suicide in the knowledge that he had survived while his parents were murdered in the Holocaust: a person rescued does not necessarily flourish. <em>Zeitgehöft</em> (1975).</p>","<p>The multilingual prodigy Paul Celan (1920–1970) was a poet, translator, and teacher. His poems, intimately personal yet also intimidatingly specific,  memorialize the Shoah. Until the end of his life, he lived in Paris, working at the École Normale Supérieure as a lecturer in German — a position he nearly refused because he felt it beneath him. However, assigning students translation exercises was a source of pleasure for him. His own vast translation résumé included Giuseppe Ungaretti, Henri Michaux, Marianne Moore, Fernando Pessoa, and others. He considered his translations of Osip Mandelstam as important as his own poetry. Paul Celan often strayed from literalism, enhancing lines with insertions, omissions, and autobiographical touches. Reworking Emily Dickinson, Celan approaches the last line of her stanza,</p>
<pre>
         Let down the bars, O Death!
         The tired flocks come in
         Whose bleating ceases to repeat,
         Whose wandering is done.
</pre>
<p>and alters it to, “Wer nicht mehr wandert, kommt.” (“Who wanders no more, comes.”)</p>
<p>The sly addition of <em>kommt</em> (“comes”) is quite the creative betrayal. Here we behold the deadly playfulness of Celan’s imagination, and also, how he expects to be translated. I will not speak of his death. But let the reader imagine what this one word, <em>kommt</em>, could have meant in his life.</p>","<p>David F. Ting works for a renowned lung cancer specialist as a medical scribe. He is eager to get into medical school when the time is right. He is a proud alum of both Penn and Princeton. He occasionally wonders how a translation can survive on its own, if annotations must travel with it like overweight luggage. At the time of this writing, he is about to fly across the country. He is flying alone, he has a good mask, and he is probably thinking about egg tarts.</p>",German,de,/assets/images/images_21/celan.jpg,photo by Heta Patel,"<div>

Peri Rossi’s poetic work over the past fifty years creates an archive of lesbian affection and queer kinship, centering desire, eroticism, and intimacy. My translations of her work are informed by an attention to that intimacy, and “Come”/“Ven” is no exception. One such approach to this work was including select fragments of the Spanish within the English version in order to signal intimate speech acts. There are certain terms of endearment that transcend recontextualization in English, but there are also those that signal a familiarity and exclusivity that I choose to illuminate by setting them apart linguistically. By highlighting the lovers’ dialogue in Spanish (“te esnifas el tiempo,” literally “you are sniffing time,” meaning “you are wasting time,” and “un día es largo como un siglo,” literally “a day is long as a century”), I remind the reader that these speech acts are exclusive, separate, yearning, undressed.</p>","<p>Cristina Peri Rossi is a Uruguayan novelist, poet, and translator. Born in Montevideo, she has lived in Barcelona since the 1970s, when she went into political exile.

إختاري الحب.. أو اللاحب
فجبنٌ ألا تختاري..
لا توجد منطقةٌ وسطى
ما بين الجنة والنار..
إرمي أوراقك كاملةً..
وسأرضى عن أي قرار..
قولي. إنفعلي. إنفجري
لا تقفي مثل المسمار..
لا يمكن أن أبقى أبداً
كالقشة تحت الأمطار
إختاري قدراً بين اثنين
وما أعنفها أقداري..
مرهقةٌ أنت.. وخائفةٌ
وطويلٌ جداً.. مشواري
غوصي في البحر.. أو ابتعدي
لا بحرٌ من غير دوار..
الحب مواجهةٌ كبرى
إبحارٌ ضد التيار
صلبٌ.. وعذابٌ.. ودموعٌ
ورحيلٌ بين الأقمار..
يقتلني جبنك يا امرأةً
تتسلى من خلف ستار..
إني لا أؤمن في حبٍ..
لا يحمل نزق الثوار..
لا يكسر كل الأسوار
لا يضرب مثل الإعصار..
آهٍ.. لو حبك يبلعني
يقلعني.. مثل الإعصار..
إني خيرتك.. فاختاري
ما بين الموت على صدري
أو فوق دفاتر أشعاري
لا توجد منطقةٌ وسطى
ما بين الجنة والنار..","I’ve asked that you choose
between dying on my chest
or atop a notebook of my poetry.
Choose love, or no love.
Not choosing is cowardice.
There can be no compromise
between Paradise and Hellfire.

Throw in all your cards,
And I’ll be content with any decision.
Talk to me. Become inflamed — Explode!
Just don’t stand unwavering like a nail.
It’s impossible for me to wait here forever
like hay under the rain.
Choose one destiny between the two —
and oh, how extreme my options are.

You’re exhausted, and scared,
and my journey is very long.
Plunge into the sea with me, or leave.
There’s no sea without a little seasickness.
Love is a major confrontation
Like navigating against the current;
Trial, torment, and tears
Like‬ traveling between moons.‬

Your cowardice is killing me, woman.
You’re sneaking around behind a curtain.
I don’t trust a love
that isn’t as reckless as a revolutionary,
that won’t tear down every wall,
that doesn’t surge like a cyclone —
Yes, if only your love were to swallow me,
to tear me out by the roots, like a tornado.

I’ve asked that you choose
between dying on my chest
Or atop a notebook of my poetry.
There can be no compromise
between Paradise and Hellfire.
","<p>This poem was recommended to me by an Arabic-speaking friend (who also proofread my translation, bless her). I loved the beautiful and — is it silly to say? — poetic metaphors that Qabbani employs throughout the poem. These images translated very well into English. Descriptions such as “like hay under the rain” need no explanation or elaboration to connote the sense of slowly soaking into uselessness and rotting away; the metaphor itself does all of that already. Though no contextualization was needed, the tricky part was simply choosing the right words to illustrate those metaphors and to maintain the same implications.</p>
<p>I found myself struggling with the tone of the speaker. Because the poem is mostly in the imperative, he comes across as a bit harsh and exasperated with his beloved and her waffling. However, he at times also softens his words, as in the end of the second verse and beginning of the third, in which he recognizes how difficult his request is for her and how much he is asking of her. Striking a balance between his exasperation and his understanding of her was difficult.</p>
<p>I did take a bit of license with the specific grammatical structures of a few lines for clarity, as well as with alliteration, which was not quite as present in the original text but was in keeping with its original lyrical fluidity. Lines like “trial, torment, and tears” could have perhaps been more directly translated as “harshness, torment, and tears,” but I found “trial” to suit the sense of the line, as well as its sound, better. The original text I used also did not have stanza breaks. I inserted these based on common divisions I found in other versions and translations of the poem, as well as on where they seemed most fitting content-wise.</p>","<p>Nizar Qabbani was a Syrian poet, writer, diplomat, and intellectual, though he is most widely known for his poetry. Qabbani was born in Damascus in 1923. He is considered one of the most prominent Arab poets, and often wrote on social and political themes, such as feminism and Arab nationalism; he also wrote many erotic and love poems, such as this one. Qabbani’s work was often controversial both for its social and sexual progressivism, but he remained a beloved public figure internationally. He also worked in the Syrian diplomatic service for many years, writing all the while. Qabbani married twice, first to Zahra Aqbiq and later to Balqis al-Rawi, an Iraqi diplomat, whose death in a 1981 bombing in Beirut deeply affected him. He wrote extensively about his love for al-Rawi both before and after her death. Qabbani himself died in London in 1998 and was buried in Damascus. He is considered to be Syria’s national poet.</p>","<p>Leah Baxter is a senior in the College studying English, linguistics, and modern Middle Eastern studies. She has been studying Arabic for about four years, including briefly in Jordan through the Middlebury College language immersion program. She does not have any firm post-grad plans, but loves literary translation and hopes to continue her language study in the future. She loves reading, especially science fiction, and using postcards as wall decorations.</p>",Arabic,ar,,,"<div>

Выпавший утром снег
был первой страницей
еще не написанных мемуаров
          о больших телах
заключенных в ограниченные пространства


Трением ли, теплоизоляцией
или ощущением потерянности
          и неопределенности
вызываются приливы крови к вискам?


Когда теряется элемент выбора
          укладываешься в систему
          и забываешь думать
наступает Смена Времен Года","- trees grow all around,
but I’m a naked, drunken, healthy cow, a poetess,

should I tell you my name?
- no, you better not.
- i’ll swing by houses, you know, to sort of grace them…
red circles are all around, can’t see anything at all…

beams of light come from me, going in all directions…
maybe i’m some sort of saint?!
- of course, you’re a saint, without a doubt!
by the way, your phone line was cut off ’cause of me,
even though i’d never even seen it…
you know, your phone is a total piece of shit, you motherfucker!

Snow, having fallen in the morning,
was the first page
of memoirs yet to be written
          about big bodies
imprisoned in a confined space

Is it through friction, insulation,
or a feeling of being adrift,
          of uncertainty
that rushes of blood are driven to the temples?

When the element of choice is lost,
          you fit into the system
          and forget to think
the season’s change is coming.
","<p>I began with a literal translation of the poem, ignoring word order and providing several translations of the same words to choose from later. Next, I formatted lines to match the original poem. Before moving onto polishing, I also identified turns of phrase that would need more time and thought to accurately incorporate into a final product. In polishing my rough translation of Mogutin’s poem, I began by adjusting word order to best match the point of syllabic emphasis in each clause, while with Mayakovsky’s I focused more on the emotions behind the poem. I then moved to honing in on word choices, leaving notes that indicated desired sentiment where I was still unsure of what I wanted to highlight. Next, I read through, thoughtfully evaluating and altering verb choices based on verbal aspect and active-passive voice within the clause. Lastly, I reviewed capitalization, punctuation, and line breaks to best match the original. A series of more detailed notes regarding stylistic choices in my translation are listed below:</p>
<ul class=""note""><strong>“Conversation of a drunk poetess and her new lover”:</strong></ul>
<li class=""note""><span lang= ""ru""><em>захожу в дома</em></span> — To maintain the poetess’ conversational tone, I translated the prefix <span lang= ""ru""><em>за-</em></span> as indicative of fleeting entrances, in which “I swing by” felt more appropriate.</li>
<li class=""note""><span lang= ""ru""><em>благодать такая</em></span> —  <span lang= ""ru""><em>Такая</em></span> indicates a conversational ellipsis and buffer around the verb. I added “sort of” to add a brief pause to the line and slightly dampen the verb’s delivery.</li>
<li class=""note""><span lang= ""ru""><em>от меня лучи во все стороны</em></span> — “Beams” highlighted the emanating light of a saintly glow. I added “of light” to ensure readers wouldn’t picture large beams of wood protruding from the poetess. I inserted “going” into my translation of <span lang= ""ru""><em>во все стороны</em></span> to highlight the outward movement indicated by the accusative case while maintaining a similar meter.</li>
<li class=""note""><span lang= ""ru""><em>между прочим, тебе телефон из-за меня отключили</em></span> — I originally translated this section as “it was cause of me that your phone line / was cut off.” I moved “cause of me” to the second line to improve the flow of the first. I also shortened “because"" to “cause,” to soften the point of emphasis on “me” in the sentence.</li>
<li class=""note""><span lang= ""ru""><em>телефон твой пиздец совсем, е.т.м.!</em></span> — I was struck by the sudden heatedness of this line and hoped to highlight it. I considered “your phone is totally fucked up,” but didn’t want the line sounding redundant when paired with the <span lang= ""ru""><em>е.т.м.!</em></span> (“fuck your mother”). Given the wide range of meanings for <span lang= ""ru""><em>пиздец</em></span>, “your phone is a total piece of shit, you motherfucker” fit the build and tone of the line best.</li>","<p>Slava Mogutin, born in Kemerovo, Siberia, in 1974, is a New York-based artist, writer, and social activist. Slava’s career began with writing for independent newspapers and media outlets in Moscow. Son of Soviet poet and novelist Yuri Mogutin, Slava’s background in writing proved useful as he forged his career in journalism. His 1994 staged registry for a same-sex marraige liscence with his partner Robert Filipinni drew media attention as the first of its kind in the Russian Federation, but was rejected following a failed referendum of a 1969 Soviet law defining marriage as “a voluntary union between a man and woman.” Ensuing police harassment and another charge for “inflaming national, social, and religious division” motivated his subsequent immigration to New York.</p>
        <p>Mogutin’s writing centers themes of queerness and masculinity, and is heavily influenced by his experiences as an immigrant and dissident. His poems confront societal norms unabashedly. In New York, Slava continues to publish his work. His publications include titles in Russian, translations of Allen Ginsberg, monographs, essays, poems, and prose. Mogutin is the winner of the Andrey Bely Prize, and his writing and photography have been featured in publications worldwide, including the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Stern</i>, <i>Flash Art</i>, <i>Libération</i>, and the <i>Calvert Journal</i>.</p>
<p>Vladimir Mayakovsky—poet, playwright, satirist, revolutionary, and futurist — was born in present-day Georgia to a Cossack father of noble descent and a Ukrainian mother. Moving to Moscow as a teenager, Mayakovsky was radicalized and joined local socialist groups. Following a brief prison sentence, Vladimir distanced himself from the Party, focusing instead on his independent socialist education. Mayakovsky discovered his literary voice as he became more involved in the Moscow artists’ circles of the 1910s. He made his name in Futurist literary magazines with early poems like “Night” and “Take That!” Mayakovsky played a key role in early Bolshevik literature following the October Revolution, supporting socialist ideology not only in his writing but also through plays, film, and agitational propaganda. Mayakovsky’s <em>Vladimir Ilyich Lenin</em>, a poetic epic in tribute to the vanguard of the revolution, was applauded by both the Party and Soviet citizens. After the release of two satire pieces in the late 1920s, Vladimir’s relationship with the Party began to deteriorate and Soviet media targeted him in media campaigns. Following an argument with a romantic partner in 1930, Mayakovsky died of suicide. Mayakovsky’s pioneered Futurist and Socialist Realist genres, gaining revered status in the Soviet canon.</p>","<p>Ryan is an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing a degree in Russian and Eastern European studies. He holds various writing and editing positions for the School of Russian and Asian Studies, Pomona College <em>Vestnik</em>, and <em>Doublespeak Magazine</em>. Ryan’s main research interests lie in the study of underground cultural movements in Soviet and post-Soviet Eurasia, most recently focusing on the Leningrad Rock and Siberian Punk movements of the 1980s and ’90s. He enjoys reading, climbing, and getting lost on walks. He plans to continue learning languages, having most recently started a course in Czech.

Ведь, если звезды зажигают —
значит — это кому-нибудь нужно?
Значит — кто-то хочет, чтобы они были?
Значит — кто-то называет эти плевочки
жемчужиной?
И, надрываясь
в метелях полуденной пыли,
врывается к богу,
боится, что опоздал,
плачет,
целует ему жилистую руку,
просит —
чтоб обязательно была звезда! —
клянется —
не перенесет эту беззвездную муку!
А после
ходит тревожный,
но спокойный наружно.
Говорит кому-то:
“Ведь теперь тебе ничего?
Не страшно?
Да?!”

","Listen!
After all, if the stars are set alight,
does it mean anyone needs it?
Does it mean someone wants them to be?
Does it mean someone is calling these spitlets pearls?
And, toiling away
in the torrents of midday dust,
he bursts in on God,
fears that he was late,
cries,
kisses his veiny hand,
asks 
that there must be stars! -
swears 
he will not bear this starless torment!
And after,
he walks about, restless,
but outwardly calm.
Saying to someone:
‘You don’t have anything now, do you?
You aren’t scared?
Right?!’
Listen!
After all, if the stars
are set alight,

Does it mean it’s necessary

above the roofs,
at least one star is set ablaze?!

four-poems,Cuatro poemas,Four Poems,Tamara Grosso,Claudia Nuñez de Ibieta,"Día 1  
No te tengo miedo, 
vi derrumbarse 
cosas más imponentes 
que tus prejuicios.

Día 15 
Le escribo poemas de desamor 
a mi oficio 
que me prometió cosas y no cumplió. 
Le escribo poemas de desamor 
a los movimientos políticos 
en los que busqué refugio y no encontré. 
Le escribo poemas de desamor 
a mis poemas viejos 
que no tienen la fuerza que necesito 
que me envíen desde el pasado. 
No le escribo esos poemas 
a las personas que amé: 
para ellas la promesa 
de que voy a seguir tratando de ilusionarme 
como si no hubiéramos aprendido juntas 
que casi todo termina mal.

Día 20 
Mi profesor de historia 
del secundario 
también era escritor y nos decía 
que teníamos que crecer para contar 
nuestra historia afuera 
del frasco de mayonesa. 
Nunca estuve segura 
a qué se refería: 
al colegio de monjas, 
al conurbano, 
a la clase media. 
Me esforcé por salir 
del frasco 
mirarlo en perspectiva 
entender qué había adentro 
y qué había afuera. 
No pude,  
a donde voy 
mi contexto viene conmigo 
creo que no quiero contar  
mis aventuras afuera del frasco 
quiero mostrar 
como veo el mundo desde ahí. 

Día 25 
Yo no subo poemas  
a las redes sociales 
dice alguien que no sé 
dónde cree que tienen que estar: 
en un libro cerrado 
en la universidad 
en manos de la crítica 
en un cajón 
donde no pueda encontrarlos nadie 
“que no los merezca.”
Yo no quiero  
dejar mis poemas en ningún lado 
donde no pueda  
encontrarlos cualquiera, por ejemplo yo 
a los trece, a los quince 
cuando no sabía qué libros comprarme 
cuando vivía en Ciudadela 
cuando no leía poesía.","Day 1
I’m not afraid of you,
I’ve seen the collapse 
of more impressive things
than your prejudice.

Day 15
I write unlove poems 
to my craft
that made me promises and didn’t keep them.
I write unlove poems 
to the political movements
where I sought refuge and didn’t find it.
I write unlove poems 
to my old poems
that haven’t got the strength I need 
them to send me from the past.
I don’t write those poems 
to the people I loved:
for them the promise
that I will keep holding on to hopes
as if we hadn’t learned together 
that almost everything ends badly.

Day 20
My high-school history 
teacher
was also a writer and used to say
we needed to grow up to tell
our story outside
the jar of mayonnaise.
I was never sure
what he meant by it:
the school run by nuns,
the suburbs,
the middle class.
I made an effort to get out
of the jar
to look at it in perspective
to understand what was inside it
and what was outside.
I couldn’t,
wherever I go
my context comes with me
I think I don’t want to tell
my adventures outside the jar
I want to show
how I see the world from there.

Day 25
I don’t post poems
on social media
says someone whom I don’t 
know where they think poems should be:
in a closed book
in a university
in the hands of critics
in a drawer
where no one can find them
“who doesn’t deserve them.”
I don’t want
to leave my poems anywhere
they can’t be 
found by anyone, for instance me
at age thirteen, at fifteen
when I didn’t know which books to buy
when I lived in Ciudadela
when I didn’t read poetry.","<p>These four poems are from <em>Cuando todo refugio se vuelva hostil</em> (<em>When Every Refuge Turns Hostile</em>), which Grosso published in 2019, and I first heard her read in 2020 during a virtual event featuring pandemic poetry. Just the way she had numbered her days, way before all of us began counting each pandemic day, proved to be an example of her signature style. Examining herself and her social milieu, her verses trace the coming of age and awareness of a young and avid reader and writer for whom words are not just the currency of everyday life, but a practical science. Making observations of tangible moments or psychological ones, Grosso questions emotions, prejudices, old habits — her own and others’. In clever quips, anxiety-inducing moments are brought under control by the power of words.</p>
<p>In a sense, translating these poems into English was quite straightforward when it came to word choice, for meaning, but striking the same tone as the original is the challenge, the goal. For example, in “Day 15,” “poemas de desamor” becomes “unlove poems;” it seems to be an easy and transparent choice and I’m not unhappy with it at all, but I can’t shake the sense that the word <em>desamor</em> will always sound more dramatic than the word “unlove,” and I can’t change that. More of a puzzle, in the same poem, was the verb <em>ilusionarse</em>, for which the translation becomes a compound of verbs, and offers the chance to try various combinations until the one sounding most lyrical is found.</p>
<br><p>In another poem, “Day 20,” the use of a funny expression might have posed a puzzle, but since it’s actually not a widely used colloquialism necessitating a determined English equivalent, a literal translation worked well to elicit the same quizzical response it provokes in the original. Suffice it to say, the choice phrase in question, the “mayonnaise jar” from which Grosso decides not to remove herself, serves as the phrase with which she declares where she is writing <em>from</em>. It’s an imaginative metaphor, a form she often employs, along with her wry humor, to surpass or solve the question posed by the poem. In her well-meditated but short answers, her poetry empowers both writer and reader. Her succinct texts, born into a world of strong social media use, are <strong>meant</strong> to be shared widely. The fact that Grosso is adamant that anyone should be able to find her poems — “anyone, for instance me at age thirteen, at fifteen, when I didn’t know which books to buy, when I lived in Ciudadela, when I didn’t read poetry” — has garnered her thousands of enthusiastic Spanish-language readers and followers. It’s the translator’s intention that this generation of English-language readers have the chance to engage as well.</p>","<p>Tamara Grosso was born in 1991, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She earned her degree in communication studies from the University of Buenos Aires. Grosso has worked as an editor and media content coordinator, and managed press for the publisher Eterna Cadencia, while incessantly writing and publishing her poetry along the way: <em>Entre el blanco y el negro</em> (De la Grieta, 2015), <em>Márgenes</em> (Objeto Editorial, 2016), <em>Guatepeor</em> (Modesto Rimba, 2016), <em>Cuando todo refugio se vuelva hostil</em> (Santoslocos, 2019), with work also appearing in the poetry anthology <em>Otros colores para nosotras</em> (Continente, 2018). Additionally, she is one of the coordinators of the poetry workshop <em>Cómo perder el miedo y volver a encontrarlo</em> (“How to lose your fear and find it again”).

returns to the moon

*Nightjars are small, 
nocturnal or crepuscular (twilight) birds;
the gray nightjar is particular to East Asia.","<p>At first glance, you may notice that I prioritized expressing the haiku’s overall succinctness over the strict five-seven-five syllable pattern. Moreover, I tussled with grammar and vocabulary ambiguities in these poems, as well as the features of traditional haiku: one, the <em>kigo</em> <span lang= ""ja"">季語</span>, a seasonal phrase; and two, the <em>kireji</em> <span lang= ""ja"">切れ字</span>, to convey emphasis, contrast, or other nuances.</p>
<p>In the first haiku, the <em>ya</em> <span lang= ""ja"">や</span> <em>kireji</em> juxtaposes two elements, and I chose to use a colon, rather than a dash or emphatic “oh!” to preserve the gentleness of the contemplation. I also considered why first snowfalls were <em>yo ni aru </em> / <em>hito no koto</em>, or “living people’s business.” Perhaps it’s not just because we like to measure the natural world through human-made joys and concerns, from postcard scenes to snow-shoveling woes, but also because we simply must exist alongside such markers of passing time. So, I chose “matter” to translate <em>koto</em> (“business”) to imply this obligatory quality and “mortal” rather than “living” being because, to me, a first snowfall emphasizes that impermanence.</p>
<p>In the second, I took some creative liberty to add “how” and “<em>in</em> dance” to provide continuous grammatical structure, and rhymed “whirl” and “twirl” for a similar effect as the reduplicative phrase <em>kuru-kuru</em> (“spinning”). Moreover, I chose “amongst” over “among” since its <em>s</em> matches the <em>s</em> in dance and <em>f</em> in drifting; they convey a whispery lull as a small kitty plays serenely in after-autumn leaves.</p>
<p>Finally, in the third haiku, I tackled the <em>kigo</em> <em>tama arare</em>, or “graupel” (which is essentially smaller hail). Since graupel isn’t well-known, I took inspiration from <em>tama</em> (“bead, gem”) and translated the <em>kigo</em> as “pearls of hail.” I selected the indefinite “a” and not “the” for the nightjar, to highlight mystery and melancholy. I imagine this scene as after a chilly storm — where an unnamed little bird, with a warm sigh of relief, takes to the lemon-lit moon cushioned atop bluish treescapes — as tiny pearls dot its wings and trace its flight-path home.</p>","<p>History remembers <span lang= ""ja"">小林一茶</span> Kobayashi Issa (1763–1827) as one of the four Great Haiku Poets of Japan, following the most-known Matsuo Basho of the seventeenth century. With his name registered as Nobuyuki, Issa was his pen name, meaning “a cup of tea” and gained him recognition for writing over twenty-thousand haiku, creating accompanying art, and other works like <em>haibun</em> (a mix of prose and haiku) and <em>renga</em> (collaborative linked verse). Issa’s life was quite sorrowful despite his popularity at the time, and he endured the deaths of his first wife and three children, as well as frequent economic instability.</p>
<p>The sheer simplicity, blunt humor, and ordinary subject matter of Issa’s works contrast the more ceremonious character of traditional, Basho-style haiku. Issa often wrote about nature’s tiniest inhabitants: cats, birds, and even mosquitoes, touching upon empathy, loneliness, and the human condition. This search for understanding in the smallest parts of our universe is something that struck me with warmth and nostalgia — like finishing the last sip of a cup of tea.</p>","<p>Vanessa is a rising sophomore studying computer science and Ethnicity, Migration and Rights at Harvard University who has studied Japanese for over two years. She is an aspiring techie and “when-I-have-free-time"" writer, finding comfort in vignettes, haikus, and other minute forms. She was inspired to translate poetry after buying a Japanese haiku collection translated into Mandarin. Vanessa spent her quarantine in the NJ suburbs drinking lattes, learning to dance, and overthinking a tad too much.

the-sand-and-the-angel,La sabbia e l’angelo,The Sand and the Angel,Margherita Guidacci,Quinn Gruber,"I.
Non occorrevano i templi in rovina 
sul limitare dei deserti,
Con le colonne mozze e le gradinate 
che in nessun luogo conducono;
Né i relitti insabbiati, 
le ossa biancheggianti lungo il mare;
E nemmeno la violenza 
del fuoco contro i nostri campi e le case.
Bastava che l’ombra sorgesse 
dall’angolo più quieto della stanza,
O vegliasse dietro 
la nostra porta socchiusa —
La fine pioggia ai vetri, 
un pezzo di latta che gemesse nel vento:
Noi sapevamo già di appartenere alla morte.

II.
Se vuoi lasciare la tua impronta, 
o uomo, scalfisci piuttosto la sabbia,
Perché la più alta torre 
diverrà sabbia alla fine.
Scrivi il tuo nome sul lido deserto, 
e prega il mare che presto lo cuopra di lamento:
Perché tu stesso sei sabbia, 
sei la morte che dopo te rimane.

III.
Ogni volta che 
dicemmo addio;
Ogni volta che verso la fanciullezza ci volgemmo, 
alle nostre spalle caduta,
(Tremando l’anima 
al suo lungo lamento);
Ogni volta che dall’amato 
ci staccammo nel freddo chiarore dell’alba;
Ogni volta che vedemmo 
su morti occhi l’enigma richiudersi;
O anche quando semplicemente 
ascoltavamo il vento nelle strade deserte,
E guardavamo l’autunno 
trascorrere sulla collina,
Stava l’Angelo al nostro 
fianco e ci consumava.

IV.
Ora il nostro amore 
si spanderà nella vigna e nel grano,
Il nostro veleno 
nei cactus e negli spini crudeli.
Si curveranno i vivi 
alle sorgenti, diranno:
«Chi spinse verso noi l’acqua 
da occulte vene del mondo?»
E molto prima che il freddo 
li colga e la notte sul loro cuore s’adagi,
Anche in un meriggio d’api e 
di succhi ardenti,
Conosceranno l’angoscia 
perché potenti noi siamo e vicini,
E non vi è fuga dal cerchio 
in cui già li stringiamo,
Con ogni stelo da noi sorto, 
ed ogni frutto che colmo e grave alla nostra terra s’inchina.

V.
Furono ultime a staccarsi le voci. 
Non le voci tremende
Della guerra e degli uragani,
E nemmeno voci umane ed amate,
Ma mormorii d’erbe e d’acque, 
risa di vento, frusciare
Di fronde tra cui scoiattoli 
invisibili giocavano,
Ronzio felice d’insetti 
attraverso molte estati 
Fino a quell’insetto che 
più insistente ronzava
Nella stanza dove noi non 
volevamo morire.
E tutto si confuse in una nota, 
in un fermo
E sommesso tumulto, 
come quello del sangue
Quando era vivo il nostro sangue. 
Ma sapevamo ormai
Che a tutto ciò era impossibile rispondere.
E quando l’Angelo ci chiese: 
«Volete ancora ricordare?»
Noi stessi l’implorammo: 
«Lascia che venga il silenzio!»

VI.
Non il ramo spezzato, 
non l’erba scomposta lungo i sentieri
Ci dicevano il suo passaggio, 
ma il tocco di solitudine
Che ogni cosa in sé custodiva 
ed a noi rendeva, liberando
Dopo il messaggio 
consueto l’altra, l’ignota parola.
Come trasalivamo ascoltandola, 
come s’orientava sicuro
Il nostro cuore 
sull’invisibile traccia!
Così noi sempre ti seguimmo, 
Dominatore ed Amato,
Né ci sorprende la bianca luce 
in cui svelato al nostro fianco cammini,
(Ora che l’ombra carnale 
è tramontata sul meridiano della morte),
Poiché da lungo tempo 
te solo conoscevamo, a te solo 
Obbedivamo, tua destinata preda,
Trascinando sulle vie della 
terra la tua celeste catena straniera.
","I.
We did not need the temples 
in ruin at the edge of deserts,
With broken columns and 
stairs that led nowhere;
Nor the sand-buried shipwrecks, 
the bleached bones along the sea;
Not even the violence of fire against 
our fields and homes. 
It was enough that the shadow rose 
from the quietest corner of the room,
Or kept vigil behind our half-closed door —
The thin rain on the windows, 
a sheet of tin that groaned in the wind:
We already knew we belonged to death.

II.
If you want to leave your trace, 
man, score the sand instead,
Because the highest earth 
will become sand in the end.
You write your name on the deserted waterfront,
and pray the sea soon covers it in tears:
Because you yourself are sand, 
you are the death that remains after you.

III.
Every time we said goodbye;
Every time we turned toward childhood, 
loss at our backs,
(The soul trembling in its long lament);
Every time that we separated from a lover 
in the cold twilight of the sunrise;
Every time that we saw 
the enigma close again in dead eyes;
Or even when we simply listened 
to wind in the deserted streets,
And watched autumn pass on the hill,
The Angel was at our side and 
it consumed us.

IV.
Now our love will scatter upon 
the vineyard and the field,
Our venom in the cacti and 
the cruel thorns.
The living will croach by the springs, 
they will say:
“Who pushes toward us the water 
from hidden veins of the world?” 
And long before the cold gathers them and the night 
lays down upon their heart,
Even in a midday of bees and sweet nectars,
They will know anguish 
because we are powerful and near,
And there is no escape from the circle in 
which we already hold them,
With every stalk raised from us, 
and every full and heavy fruit 
that bows toward our earth.

V.
They were the last voices to fall quiet. 
Not the unbearable voices
Of wars and hurricanes, 
Nor the human and loved voices,
But murmurs of grasses and waters, 
laughter of the wind, rustle
Of ferns between which invisible 
squirrels played,
Hum of insects across many summers
Down to that insect 
which incessantly buzzed
In the room where 
we did not want to die.
And everything collided in a note, 
in a rest
And whispered tumult, 
like that of blood,
When our blood was living. 
But we already knew
That it was impossible to respond 
to everything.
And when the Angel asked us: 
“Do you want to remember again?”
We ourselves implored him: 
“Leave, that silence comes!”

VI.
Neither the broken branch, 
nor the trampled grass alongside the paths
Told us of its passage, 
but the touch of solitude
That each thing keeps in itself and 
returns to us, freeing
After the usual message, 
the other, unknown word. 
How we startled listening to it, 
how securely it set
Our heart on the invisible track!
So we always followed you, 
Ruler and Lover,
Nor did the the white light in 
which you walked unveiled at our side surprise us,
(Now that the carnal shadow 
has set on the horizon of death),
Since for many years you alone 
we knew, you alone
We obeyed, your destined prey, 
Dragging on the streets of the earth 
your strange celestial chain.
","<p>This series of six short poems from Margherita Guidacci’s first book of poetry, <em>La sabbia e l’angelo</em> (<em>The Sand and the Angel</em>, 1946) reckons with the relationship between humans and nature, as well as the broader cycle of life and death.</p>
<p>The last image in the poem of death as a <em>celeste catena straniera</em>, a “strange celestial chain,” particularly captivated me and guided my translation. I translated <em>straniero</em> as “strange” rather than the usual “foreign” because the Angel, a sort of overseer of the life/death balance, is a continuous presence in human life. I wanted “strange” to capture our inability to reconcile our knowledge of death with our own desire to live; we know death intimately, but are unable to fully comprehend what it entails.</p>
<p>As I translated the poem, I was surprised to find that Guidacci’s voice, both direct and clear, cosmic and spiritual, had an almost Romantic lilt in English that comes across in phrases such as <em>o uomo</em> (“O man,” which I translated simply as “person”) and <em>Dominatore ed Amato</em> (“Ruler and Lover”). It’s crucial to note that Guidacci was not invested in the closed style of her contemporaries, the Hermetic poets; she instead used a more “ordinary” language to form the complex meanings and sounds of her works. Keeping this in mind, I tried to adhere as closely as I could to the flexible sentence order common to Italian while still maintaining sense in English, to convey that sense of familiarity and strangeness that coexists in the work.</p>
<p>What struck me most deeply about the poem is how Guidacci recognizes the brevity of human life without assuming that our lives do not matter because of it. Rather, our absence serves as a permanent reminder of our existence: “Perché tu stesso sei sabbia, sei la morte che dopo te rimane.” “Because you yourself are sand, you are the death that remains after you.”</p>
","<p>Margherita Guidacci (1921–1992, Florence) was an Italian poet and translator. Without companions her own age, Guidacci’s childhood was marked by solitude and a series of losses — most notably, the death of her father — that led her to poetry and literature. Guidacci graduated in 1943 from the Università di Firenze with a degree in Italian literature; only three years later, <em>La sabbia e l’angelo</em> marked the beginning of her prolific literary career, over the course of which she received many prestigious awards, such as the Biela Poesia Prize and the Premio Caserta. Her poetry fused the domestic and the universal, resounding with deep emotion, yet stunningly clear. Alongside her many books of poetry, Guidacci published translations of the works of Emily Dickinson, Ernest Hemingway, H.D., T.S. Eliot, John Donne, and many others. Her teaching career was just as prolific: she taught Latin, Greek, and English at a precollege level and later became a professor of Anglophone literature.</p>","<p>Quinn Gruber is a junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying English and Italian literature. They edit for <em>DoubleSpeak</em>, <em>Q-INE</em>, and <em>Jacket2</em>, and they are a cocurator for the Kelly Writers House Zine Library. Their research interests include Dante, Joyce, twentieth- and twenty-first-century English and Italian poetry, and zines, especially the queer ones.

Tu es l’idée du Tout et la voix de l’Ancien.
Lancée grave à l’assaut des chimères

En gerbes miraculeuses sur les côtes de l’oubli.","Black woman my hot rumble of Africa
My land of enigma and my fruit of reason
You are dance by the nude joy of your smile
By the offering of your breasts and your secret powers
You are dance by the golden legends of wedding nights
By new times and ancient rhythms 
Black woman unceasing triumph of dreams and stars
Docile mistress in the kora harps’ embrace
You are dance by the giddiness
By the magic of loins beginning the world anew
You are dance
And the myths around me burn
Around me the wigs of learning
In great fires of joy in the sky of your steps
You are dance
And false gods burn beneath your vertical flame
You are the face of the initiate
Sacrificing folly beneath the guardian tree
You are the idea of All and the voice of the Ancient.
Gravely hurled to attack chimeras
You are the Word that explodes
In miraculous bursts on the coasts of oblivion.
","<p>In “To a Black Dancer,” which is often considered David Diop’s best poem, Diop celebrates the beauty, grace, and exuberance of an African woman who is performing a traditional dance. European Surrealism’s surprising juxtapositions of seemingly unrelated images and endorsement of revolutionary movements influenced Négritude poets’ writing style and anticolonial politics, both of which are evident in Diop’s experimental poem.</p>
<p><em>Rumeur</em> can mean either “rumor” or “murmur, hum, rumble,” an ambiguity which has divided other translators. I chose to translate it as “rumble” to convey the dancer’s earthshaking impact on the world and to enrich the description of her dancing with a visceral sense of sound and movement. She is not a vague “rumor of Africa” but a powerful creative force rendered in energetic images, an ecstatic personification of Africa and its vibrant traditional culture. Négritude poets often used Black female figures as symbols of Africa’s strength and potential for regeneration. Like Léopold Sédar Senghor’s poem “Black Woman” (translated by Donnisa Edmonds in the Spring 2018 issue of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>) but with more concrete imagery, Diop uses a sensual woman to evoke Africa. The dancer’s vitality embodies Diop’s pride that Africa’s present attributes and ancient traditions would redeem the continent from the damage done by colonialism.</p>
<p><em>Multiplié</em> literally means “multiplied,” but I translated it as “unceasing” to better express the idea of repeated triumphs and the proliferation “of dreams and stars” that they produce. A kora is a West African harp, so I translated <em>koras</em> as “kora harps” to define the term for an American audience and to enrich the poem’s depiction of traditional African rituals with the musical instrument that accompanies the dance. <em>Les perruques du savoir</em> (“the wigs of learning”) refers to the wigs worn as status symbols by wealthy, formally educated Europeans during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when their nations began colonizing Africa. By burning these wigs along with European “myths” and “false gods” in the flames generated by the dancer, Diop rejects French cultural imperialism and asserts the authority of African knowledge and ways of life.</p>
","<p>David Diop was born to a Senegalese father (a cousin of Léopold Sédar Senghor) and a Cameroonian mother in 1927 in Bordeaux, France. Throughout his life, he divided his time between West Africa and France. He was a radical voice of Négritude, a twentieth-century Francophone African and Caribbean literary movement that was inspired by the Harlem Renaissance and Black poets such as Langston Hughes. Négritude’s goal was to promote pride in a rich Black culture as a reaction against oppressive French colonial rule. Diop’s protest poetry is more militant than that of African poets like Senghor. His writings display the commitment to African liberation and revolt against colonialism found in Caribbean poets like Aimé Césaire.  Diop contributed poems to <em>Présence Africaine</em> (<em>African Presence</em>), an influential Parisian political and literary magazine of the African diaspora. In 1956, he published his only book, <em>Coups de pilon</em> (<em>Pestle Blows</em>), which was translated into English along with additional poems and prose pieces as <em>Hammer Blows and Other Writings</em> in 1973. He died in a plane crash near Dakar, Senegal, in 1960, days before Senghor was elected the first president of the newly independent nation.</p>","<p>Samantha DeStefano graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> from the University of Pennsylvania with a BA in English, a concentration in medieval and Renaissance literature, and minors in both classical studies and gender, sexuality, and women’s studies. At Penn, she studied Latin, Old English, and Middle English. She has published academic research in <em>Transcription Collection and Journal of the Penn Manuscript Collective</em> on a manuscript of <em>Poems, 1805–1818</em> by John Syng Dorsey, the author of the first American textbook of surgery, for which she translated quotations from Latin poetry. She published translations of David Diop’s poems “To My Mother” and “He Who Lost Everything” in the Spring 2020 issue of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>. She has near-native knowledge of Spanish, and after graduation she embarked on four years of intensive study of French.</p>",French,fr,,,"<div>

","The suspicious odyssey of an onlooker 
Wearing a broad-brimmed straw hat in the northern summer
Is reaching its climax — sometimes punctuated by peaks
Otherwise concealed by a gloomy canyon —
And is obviously slowing down
While gradually approaching a desert

A prairie on one side and a sandy land on the other
The views bewilder him who also witnesses
A river wagging its tail and a startled lizard 
Too desperate to choose its path
Travel together, hurriedly vanishing into the distance

It is when a truck faster than a river rushes by
That I behold the onlooker, his bewilderment
Unconcealable by the shadow under his broad-brimmed straw hat
And his abruptly stopped journey
With an apex mingled with slight abjection

A white swan
(Or maybe just a similar whitish thing)
And its somewhat unreal whiteness
In an autumn heavenly lake
A place farther than Xinjiang
Are sleeping with a mirror

A massive, curved boulder with black moss
And a large heap of shining-white bird droppings
On a precipitous cliff above a great river
In the ancient wind, under the wings
Of a bird determining its flight gesture
Are sleeping with time

A snake having sloughed off its white skin in a jungle
(All these exist only in imagination)
Fruitlessly chased a hungry tiger
Lost its way back to its pit
And hence fled hurriedly out of fright
Needs to hasten to the moors before night falls
To sleep with gloomy clouds and the moon

My father and his grey hair
As well as his white bones under his dark skin
All glittering with chilling white shimmers
With nowhere to rest
And with certain indescribable melancholy
In the homeland’s dreams and mine tonight
Are sleeping with the northern mountains
","<p>Yan An’s poems are highly experimental, unconventional, and unique according to the standards and traditions of Chinese culture, considering their aesthetic value, contents, philosophical denotations and meanings. As a pioneer in modern Westernized Chinese poetry, Yan An has completely transformed Chinese readers’ concepts and understanding of poetry through his unique views about the universe, life, society, and people. His way of thinking is unusual and unconventional. His poems do not contain any of the Chinese elements traditionally and commonly depicted by other Chinese poets and even if they do, they are addressed from unique perspectives. Therefore, they can transcend the boundaries between nations and cultures, reaching for a wider audience across the world. In each of his poems, behind his boundless imagination, there lies a story and Yan An’s sentiments and understandings of life, people, society, and the universe.</p>
<p>His language is intense and abstract. Just like his other poems, these poems are rich in imagery and literary devices, such as metaphor, personification, and parallelism. These literary devices have well served their purpose in the Chinese versions. Nevertheless, in their English versions, some transcreation techniques have to be exploited to retain the same or similar effect.</p>
<p>For example, the omission and restructuring techniques are combined together in translating the first two lines of the first stanza of the poem “Onlooker.” In particular, “his” is omitted, “wearing a broad-brimmed straw hat” is restructured from the first line to the second line, and “the suspicious odyssey” is restructured from the second line to the third line. Also, the spaces are switched to English conventions to make the translation more elegant. In order to delete some of the spaces, conjunctions are used as in the case of “and” and “who” in the first and second line of the second stanza, respectively.</p>
<p>All in all, we have attempted to bring something new and foreign into English to enrich it, by helping English poets and readers unleash their creativity, imagination, inspiration, and by bridging or integrating American and Chinese culture and ways of thinking. Also, we have endeavored to create some novel transcreation techniques to help with any future translation of Yan An’s poems.</p>
","<p>Yan An is one of the most famous poets in contemporary China, author of fourteen full-length poetry collections including his most famous poetry collection <em>Rock Arrangement</em>, which has won him the sixth Lu Xun Literary Prize, one of China’s top four literary prizes. As the winner of various national awards and prizes, he is also the Vice President of Shaanxi Writers Association, the head and Executive Editor-in-Chief of the literary journal, Yan River, one of the oldest and most famous literary journals in Northwestern China. In addition, he is a member of the Poetry Committee of China Writers Association. His poetry book <em>A Naturalist’s Manor</em>, translated by Chen Du and Xisheng Chen, will be published by Chax Press.</p>","<p>Chen Du is a Voting Member of American Translators Association and a member of the Translators Association of China with a Master’s Degree in Biophysics from Roswell Park Cancer Institute, the State University of New York at Buffalo and a Master’s Degree in Radio Physics from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. She revised more than eight chapters of the Chinese translation of the biography of Helen Snow, <em>Helen Foster Snow – An American Woman in Revolutionary China</em>.

The meaning of this poem is Pavel trying to find hope where he is. He finds hope when he sees this beautiful yellow butterfly but he sees it drift away, and he never sees it again. I wanted to preserve the spacing and alignments of the original because I feel like it was very important in the original, the emphasis of him not seeing a butterfly and then the indents on “the ghetto” added to the importance of not seeing such a hopeful creature in such a sad place. The word “ghettoized” is an uncomfortable term and not a very common term, and I thought it fit perfectly with the literal awkwardness of the German language and what the poem meant, but I wanted to make sure the readers understood the term stick outs by making the word a bit smaller than the rest.</p>","<p>Pavel Friedmann was a Jewish Czechslovakian poet who was famous for his poem “Der Schmetterling.” Very little is known about his early life.

","<p>“Verb” by Pablo Neruda explores language at its very core – as a medium for conveying the human experience. Yet Neruda, in his poem, latches onto that liminal space of the inexpressible, yearning for words that could begin to capture the pain of the Latin American people. With this in mind, I knew that translating this poem would require diligent attention to diction. And like Neruda, I wanted to use words that were intense, synesthetic, and multiplicitous. Below is a brief description of the thought process behind some of these selections.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Arrugar</em> means “to wrinkle,” “to crumple,” or “to shrivel.” I opted for “shrivel” not only because of its stronger connotation but because becoming shriveled necessitates a loss of water. This provides an interesting contrast to the water motif (river, thirst, etc.)</li>
<li><em>Torcer</em> means “to twist, “to bend,” or “to sprain.” I landed on “sprain” because it evokes a sense of physicality and pain which is reflected in the rest of the poem. </li>
<li><em>Lisa</em> means “smooth,” “flat,” or “plain.” I chose “plain” not only because it conveys the blandness of the word but also because it references a geographical feature which is flat in itself. This additionally connects with the river erosion imagery at the end of the stanza.</li>  
<li><em>Aspereza</em> means “roughness,” “sourness,” or “sharpness.” Since roughness is associated with the sense of touch and sourness with the sense of taste, I selected “sharpness” because it evokes both senses.</li>
<li><em>Adentro</em> means “inside,” but I opted for “lodged,” which has a more intrinsic connotation. At the same time,  “lodged” can also mean “to be flattened by wind or rain,” which ties into the first stanza.</li>
<li><em>Sonido</em> means “sound” or “noise,” and I chose “noise,” which is the more intense adjective. </li></ul>","<p>Pablo Neruda (1904–1973) is one of the best-known Latin American poets of the twentieth century. Hailing from Chile, he received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971 “for a poetry that with the action of an elemental force brings alive a continent’s destiny and dreams.” In fact, many of his poems were imbued with a sense of politics, which was contextualized by Neruda’s ardent support of the Communist Party and his role as a diplomat. His famous works include <em>Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada</em> (<em>Twenty Love Poems and A Desperate Song</em>) and <em>Crepusculario</em> (<em>Book of Twilight</em>).</p>","<p>Heta Patel is a senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying Health and Societies and Hispanic Studies. Language, for her, is an extension of her interest in understanding people, the way they think, and the way their bodies interact with the world. Although this interest has largely manifested itself in her pursuing medicine and immersing herself in Spanish, she has also found writing and translating poetry instrumental in her desire to learn more about the human condition. In her free time, she enjoys curating her Spotify playlists and bullet journaling.</p>

interview-with-maria-dahvana-headley,"Interview with Maria Dahvana Headley: a conversation on translation, storytelling, and feminism",Interview with Maria Dahvana Headley,,,,,"<p><em>This interview was conducted by <strong><em>DoubleSpeak</em></strong>  staff and Professor Taije Silverman.</em></p>
 
<p><strong><em>DoubleSpeak</em></strong> The first question for today is: What got you interested in translation, and how do you see this influencing your work as a writer?</p>

<p><strong>Maria Dahvana Headley:</strong> Well, I came about this through a sort of backward path. I wrote a novel based on <em>Beowulf</em>, which is called <em>The Mere Wife</em>, set in contemporary America from the POV of the female characters. When <em>The Mere Wife</em> was about to come out, I gave a reading from it at a conference. In the Q&A, I was talking about all the translations I read, specifically Tolkien’s translation, and said, “Oh, you know, some of them were really sexist. They make Grendel’s mother into an emphatic, unmistakable monster.” And, someone in the audience raised their hand and said, “When is your translation coming out? You’re obviously doing one.” And, I said, “I’m not doing that.” And, then I thought about it for a few days and thought, “Well, maybe.”</p>

<p>Tolkien’s translation uses a lot of language that is archaic, but I thought while reading it, this is a “bro” story, a story in which there’s tons of masculine bragging. I saw a path to use a lot of contemporary language alongside the archaic. When I sold this translation, I said to my editor, “I want to translate <em>Beowulf</em>. I know that’s crazy, but I want to do it. I’ll translate the first word, the legendary <em>hwæt</em>, which is often translated as ‘hark’ or ‘lo’ or Seamus Heaney’s legendary ‘so,’ as ‘bro’ and use that to lead us to a POV for opening the story.” In terms of getting the floor and establishing a character perspective within the material through translation, I thought that “bro” was a way to do that.</p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> That’s very cool. I think I’m really fascinated by the opening with the word “bro” and also the idea that you mentioned in your introduction, which is the mixing of archaic words and new words as if dropping fossils next to newborns. I really loved this metaphor and the idea of putting words together that seem to come from different historical periods but make sense to us with a sense of universality and timelessness. Can you tell us more about that?</p>

<p><strong>MDH:</strong> Yeah, I did that consciously. I wanted to give us a tour through 1300 years of the English language. Old English evolved into contemporary English, but not always in the ways that we would think. It’s a really interesting trove, and it has words that have transformed almost perfectly into their contemporary equivalents and words that are really different. So, I wanted to use this translation to think about storytelling through history and the ways in which we communicate idioms and communicate references to historical events in order to create understanding across cultures.</p>

<p>There’s a way to do this translation entirely in contemporary slang, like a translation of the twenty-first century, but the twenty-first century is  a compendium of everything that came before it. That’s something that’s always been really meaningful to me when thinking about history, especially the history of power structures and unfair status grabs. I think we tend to be like, “No, we’re just free-standing here in <em>our</em> time.” We don’t want to think about what our history has created for us.</p>

<p>So, I wanted to think about the history of poetic language and storytelling, which is also why I use some obscenity in the poem. Of course, obscenity isn’t a modern invention. It’s been around the whole time that humans have been around. In my opinion, most of the time, obscenity is really direct poetic language because it’s not used literally. If we’re saying “fuck,” we usually don’t mean what that <em>literally</em> means. It’s a perfect example of a word that holds within it some interesting baggage and that holds within it a deeper well of accrued meaning. That’s why I used it here.</p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> I was struck by what you mentioned about how <em>Beowulf</em>, even though it is like an imagined story, is sometimes viewed as a historical text to a certain extent. What do you think about <em>Beowulf</em>’s relationship to history, and how does the historicization of <em>Beowulf</em> impact our view of its function and cultural role?</p>

<p><strong>MDH:</strong> Well, it’s interesting because, just a few weeks ago, the legendary-in-a-bad-way Rudy Giuliani referred to <em>Game of Thrones</em> as a documentary. The whole thing reflects a fairly typical confusion between poetic material and actuality, and the idea that poetic material, which is heightened and in this case fully inflated with dragons, can be used to justify real-world questionable acts. “I’m allowed to call for trial by combat because in this documentary I saw, <em>Game of Thrones</em>, it happened that way.” <em>Beowulf</em> is also really relevant to those events of January 6th at the Capitol, in terms of people appropriating what they saw to be a historically-documented version of white nationalist success. That’s a misread — it’s not the case with this material at all.</p>

<p>So, misreading poetic material as history while simultaneously neglecting the actual history is problematic. I also think that poetic material is really relevant. It is our emotional history. It tells us about desire and about yearning for a way to engage with status. In the case of monster-fighting mythology, if you fight a monster, you can acquire power that you wouldn’t otherwise have built. We have that in our culture already, of course. We have the idea of the bootstrap narrative, where you come from nothing and no one and become the king of the country. People even employ that sort of mythological language to speak about themselves. Trump does it all the time. He speaks about himself as a hero who came from no one, nobody, and nothing — all of which is a big lie. He came from money, privilege, and power via his father. But he uses the American Dream mythology to describe his own imaginary folkloric narrative, erasing the patriarchal structure that he’s massively benefiting from. I think about using these kinds of materials — i.e. thousand-year-old poetry — to point out that “legendary” language has frequently been created to support existing power structures. We can see the same power language in <em>Beowulf</em> that we see today.</p>

<p>I think about how, in our time, everyone stands on a little virtual soapbox, giving their own, often highly poetry-infused versions of events, going “I’m the hero.” We have an entire society of “heroes,” all at odds, because the reality is that you can’t be a hero professionally for your whole life. A hero can only exist in a moment, in an action. I think that the notion of heroism is just a question of whether you’re trying to do it because of the status and the legacy and wanting a statue made of you. Part of what I think people raging over the knocking down of statues has been is people imagining their own legacy status signifiers being knocked down. So, it’s that performing “heroic” acts for your own status, or it’s something else, changing the world in discrete moments and then going about your business, not expecting there to be a poem or a <em>Game of Thrones</em>–style ”documentary” that you starred in. I can think of a lot of people who’ve been heroic but weren’t seen as heroes in their lifetime, like Shirley Chisholm. There should be an epic poem about Shirley Chisholm.</p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> Something that you said really stood out to me. I’ve been taking a course about memorialization and how we as humans respond to tragedy or important events. We can either sanctify it by building memorials or statues or we can ignore it. I think you mentioned the tearing down of statues since we’re recognizing that these people were flawed and had their own personal histories. How do you see literature or the translation of these huge texts as part of that memorialization process…of how we remember the past and, in a sense, how we remember the present?</p>

<p><strong>MDH:</strong> <em>Beowulf</em> is one of those “it’s lasted this long” kind of stories. I think that the history of the way we’ve depicted power is really relevant to the way that we continue to depict power relationships. We look to the past for guidance, sure, but it’s our responsibility to look more deeply than we often have. The only way to change the nature of these depictions is to understand and analyze where we started. Change isn’t always  predictable, but by and large, it comes from the critical mass of years of re-analysis and hard work done by people with passion. I think these texts are important, <em>and</em> I think it’s important to transgress against the unspoken rules of “dignified” and inaccessible translation for important texts. I think it’s also crucial to expand the definition of <em>important</em>. I did it this way because I thought this text was right for a contemporary translation that pointed out tropes of toxic masculinity, as well as pointing out the translation history of minimizing and monsterizing marginalized characters. I could do a translation like this partially because I came from outside of academia. I wasn’t under the thumb of anyone who could tell me I wasn’t allowed to do it like this, that I’d be breaking unbreakable rules of tradition. When it was about to come out, there were a few days where I was like, “Oh, no, it’s going to be so bad.” But, instead, many people in the world of medieval literature were ready for this kind of translation. It’s just all part of a big collective project of looking at what’s important and also acknowledging that there are always more perspectives than the ones that have been analyzed. And, thinking about gaps, particularly in the old texts, is a useful thing, in terms of bringing them into the present.  Some of the work I want to be doing with a translation like this one is filling in the assumed gaps, the subtext, things that would’ve been conveyed in tone, and in knowing gestures by a <em>scop</em> performing it, and also filling in the places where the knowledge of the past has been erased. I’m always looking to help create deeper understanding across generations, cultures, and histories.</p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> I think you mentioned in the introduction that it’s like retelling stories with the full spectrum of humanity; I really loved the way you phrased that because this isn’t the last translation of <em>Beowulf</em> to exist. It’s a part of this huge narrative. Just speaking on the translation process in general, what is that like for you? How do you interact with the original text? You’ve created lots of interesting images, especially with the cowboy poets. How did this all come about and how does it work for you?</p>

<p><strong>MDH:</strong> Well, the way that I did this translation is that I did a lot of research over the course of <em>The Mere Wife</em>. I did my own literal translation line by line with the assistance of a pile of scholarship as well as nearly two hundred years worth of translations, seeing what a variety of people have thought about this material, and then I converted the literal chunks into the poetic voice that I used in this translation. I was translating myself, essentially, into meter, rhyme, and alliterative rhythm. I wasn’t sure throughout the early part of doing this if I wanted to replicate the old English meter. It doesn’t work with contemporary English in the way that you want it to work. So, I went through it, really grooming it for intelligibility, story, and POV. I created the personality of the narrator, which comes from suggestions in the text. I was interested in the kind of person that would do that in a kind of a bro tall-tale register. Some people think that this was an oral performance that was transcribed with consistent recaps that happen throughout the story. I decided to put the translation in the oral storytelling register, rather than in the register of the highbrow written word, which is often how it is translated. Miz Cracker, a drag queen who studied Old English, read the first chunk of this <em>Beowulf</em> in a group reading and said that it reminded her of drag storytelling, standing on a table, trying to get a room full of drunk people to pay attention.</p>

<p>I was also going for a story that entwined the last line with the next line, so I did rhymes and alliterations that jumped from line to line, and sometimes callbacks, so that you can remember what happened ten lines ago. I did a lot of things in service of keeping the story moving, so that reading it aloud would be as fun or more fun than reading it on the page. I wanted it to be something that you could imagine being performed, a story about something complicated that happened a long time ago, but relevant to our time. I tried my best to make these ancient kings feel like people we know.</p>

<p><strong>DS:</strong> Yeah, I think the storytelling process and translating yourself into it is something that I think will help me a lot. I was thinking of translating some Ancient Chinese poems but kind of like the old English poems, the rhythm is really strict and I find it hard to express them in coherent English sentences. Just as a wrap-up question, do you have any advice for us at <em>DoubleSpeak</em> or to other students or new translators?</p>

<p><strong>Taije Silverman:</strong> Just to add to your question, when you were talking about why you decided to translate this in the first place, you mentioned these two women who said, “You should translate this.” And <em>DoubleSpeak</em> is run by women and non-binary people and mostly people of color from all over the world. It is not a male power. So just like piggybacking on that, how did you find your company? How did you know that those women were your women and that you should listen to them, and how did you get them to speak to you like that?</p>

<p><strong>MDH:</strong> So, advice-wise, it’s all entwined with the concept that people will constantly try to tell you what you’re not allowed to do. My policy has pretty much always been to do it anyway. Years ago, I was trying to create a project where thirty-seven female and non-binary playwrights wrote new versions of all of Shakespeare’s plays. This was in 2009, and I was a little early. Theaters said, “Well, what if they aren’t good?” There was an attitude in some places that felt like, “This is Shakespeare. It’s too precious to be touched by your potentially dirty fingers.” And I’m like, Shakespeare isn’t God. No one is erasing Shakespeare by interpreting his work and adapting it into new art for new times. All that is happening is that more art is being made. I think, for people who are not cis, straight, white men, the world doesn’t tell you that you’re allowed to do your work. But yeah, no one typically gives you permission. No one tells you that you <em>can</em> do it, not usually — so at the beginning, anyway, you have to start giving yourself permission to transgress, to believe in the validity of your perspective, to do your own best and most difficult work. So, I think that just doing the challenging transgressive work yourself and by doing that, getting a sense of what you’re capable of, is the best advice that I can give.</p>

<p>And then, in contrast to that story, relatedly and luckily, there were several women who helped me realize I could and should do this translation. Two of the women who were judging the World Fantasy Awards, Betsy Mitchell and Elizabeth Engstom, gave me the idea to do this. I was a finalist for the award, and they came to my reading because they’d liked my story. From it, I guess, they had a sense that I could do this work. It hadn’t occurred to me to do this translation, even though I was just about to publish a novel all about <em>Beowulf</em>. I still thought I couldn’t do a translation because I didn’t have a PhD, and I wasn’t Seamus Heaney. But, soon after that, I took the idea of the translation to a writing retreat with a bunch of women writers, and all of them were like, “You have to do it <em>now</em>.” Once I started thinking about the ways that restrictions had been imposed on women, but also, and with increasing severity, on BIPOC and LGBTQ translators, I started thinking, “I’m going to stick my foot in that door and keep it there and see how many other people I can let in.” It’s part of my goal to help people realize that they can go through the same door that I went through.</p>

<p><strong>TS:</strong> Has your rage changed?</p>

<p><strong>MDH:</strong> Initially, the rage that helped me become a writer was a sputtering rage. Now, my rage goes into my work, which is pretty satisfying. I feel like I can be part of the tradition of storytelling and changing the world in this way.</p>

<p>I’ve also been changed by having a baby who’s a year-and-a-half old. I started talking loudly about doing the work of changing the world with a story while I was pregnant with him and while he was a newborn. Having a small child changes things, but it also brings different perspectives. Having my child as I was deep in working on the <em>Beowulf</em> poem brought a totally different perspective to the translation. I was deep in the idea of Grendel’s mother, grieving the potential loss of a child, and that’s a big part of what this poem is about. I got a new window into it. So, the things that I lost in terms of my ability to just write all day, I gained in my ability to see through the eyes of the mothers in the <em>Beowulf</em> story.</p>",,,English,en,/assets/images/images_21/interview.jpeg,photo by Chardonnay Needler,,,2021,interview

like an illusion
I saw poetry walking to me.

poets were warmly welcomed.

its moonlight illuminating
the old persimmon tree.
Then amid the sorghum field,
I saw the poet’s silhouette.

as though poetry had arrived.","<p>Kim Soon Mi chooses words that often seem to float on their own, carrying a great deal of movement and feeling in each word that makes her poetry difficult to translate. This first poem I translated carries a sense of depression and desperation starting from the very first word, <span lang= ""ko"">과오로</span>. Is it a mistake? An error? A problem? A fault? A regret? I choose the word “mistake” because there can be a certain amount of sadness in this word, but there is nothing that can be done with what has happened in the past. There is only the option of moving forward with whatever is to come. Thus, when describing the actions of the shorebirds, there needed to be a desperation in the simple actions they were performing. As Kim states, her images of shorebirds are those of constant movement and a need to get from one point to the next, and felt this reflected her own life, especially when she most recently had depression. Furthermore, I took liberties in translation by adding more lines than the original, as I wanted to emphasize the desperation the narrator emits throughout the poem.</p>
<p>“Like an illusion, poetry” was written as a moment in the year 2000 when Kim decided to become a poet. But the word, “illusion” was the most difficult word to translate. The word in English, coincidentally means “welcome” as well as “phantasm/illusion/fantasy.” Kim states that she did not intentionally choose this word, but it ultimately seemed to give readers that potential connection. Yet, when translating the poem, since we do not have a homophone word that holds both definitions, I wanted to focus on making sure the narrator was in a fantasy world, displaced from whatever current location they are in, and instead in a sort of mystical environment, where the moon would glow in vibrant color in an unbelievable size, and poetry would seem to be both present and somehow unattainable at the same time.</p>","<p>Kim Soon Mi (1959–present) is a South Korean poet born in Uiseong in the Gyeongbuk region of South Korea. Kim’s way to becoming a poet was not always at the forefront of her professional aspirations. In elementary school, she wrote a poem that was ultimately framed in the hall of her school after she graduated. That moment gave her a sense of pride and expanded her love for poetry. While she attended university to become a kindergarten teacher, she always maintained her love for the arts, not just poetry. Obtaining inspiration to pursue poetry upon reading Joongang Daily’s “The Morning in Which There is Poetry” and having studied creative writing in a poetry class outside of standardized education along with a cultural class called “Scent of English Poetry,” she developed and continued to polish her art. She debuted in 2006 with the recommendation of poet Jung Il-geun and published her first poetry book, <em>The Woman of Chagall</em> in 2015, and will be publishing her second poetry book, <em>The Woman of Terrace</em>, in 2021.</p>","<p>Nadia Park graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2019 as a communications major and French and consumer psychology minor. She is currently living in South Korea for the first time and has been balancing life working between global marketing in an IT company and being a barista. As a former member of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>, she continues to fall back into the world of poetry and translation both consciously and unconsciously, discovering and encountering non-English poems and this year — a poet.</p>",Korean,ko,/assets/images/images_21/kim_soon_mi.jpeg,photo by Nadia Park,"<div>

like-an-illusion-a-poet-and-a-translator,"Like an illusion, a poet and translator: musing","Like an illusion, a poet and translator: musing",Nadia Park,,,,"<p>Coffee became my safe space. My excitement. My calmness.
<br>Languages were gifts and opportunities to discover dreams and meaning.
<br>And like an illusion, poetry became a present.</p>

<p>As a Korean American, living in Korea was a fear I never wanted to make into a reality. I could never completely become a Korean. I had never read a book in Korean or written a simple essay. How could I fit in a world where I couldn’t express my own thoughts properly?</p>
<p>But coffee — no words, no thoughts. Just scent and touch. I had fallen in love a long time ago with the space and atmosphere that the existence of coffee was able to bring. The gentle atmosphere it creates tends to ease the stress of the people who come near it. And I was one of those people captivated by its magic, along with Kim Soon Mi, a Korean poet and the protagonist of my translations this year.</p>
<p>My first encounter with Kim was through her poetry book, <em>The Woman of Chagall</em>, left behind at Buono Buono Coffee Roasters, the coffee shop at which I became an apprentice over a year back, with a short message to another fellow apprentice. Her poems were straightforward but intricate, and the fact that she fell in love with the same space I had come to call my second home gave me a certainty that we would get along. I wanted to meet her.</p>
<p>She walked in with a backpack half the size of her body, which looked even larger than it probably was against a 160-tall lady. With a lilac-colored fedora and vibrant handmade, beaded jewelry, she took the time to greet everyone wearing a soft expression and a gentle smile. And perching down on the sofa, she proceeded to pull out about five books, stacks of papers clipped together, and a collection of sparkly stickers. After a few introduction remarks, she started what would be a five-hour conversation with the question:</p>
<p>“What is it about my poetry?”</p>
<p>As a question I don’t get asked, it seemed that whatever I would say would seem cheesy and embarrassing, as if my feelings towards her poems would give away too much of my personal thoughts. Explaining to her how I was fascinated with the simple and straightforward tone in every poem; how while I couldn’t fully understand every word of each poem, I wanted to just meet the person who was able to manifest these thoughts into such an eloquent book. And as I explained my history in translation, from translating anime and manga to being a part of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>, she graciously found every aspect admirable and fascinating.</p>
<p>She wanted to record me speaking about my poetry translations of Yun Dong-ju, the poet that inspired my translation journey. But rather than me reading the poems themselves, she focused on how I talked about the poet, striking me as a unique approach to talking about poets and translations. She too had connections with another poet and academic who had previously written a book on Yun Dong-ju. And therefore,Yun Dong-ju, who was always a star I would see on occasional days, and not be able to even see on other days because he was too far and too grand, seemed to have become more familiar the more I spoke with Kim and found out about other poets.</p>
<p>And looking forward to the publication of our work, it’s guaranteed that not all readers will enjoy the poetry she writes, whether they read it in English or in Korean. Yet, even if people can resonate with just 1% of her words, Kim finds value in writing poetry. “What do I feel and what do I want from each poem?” Even for Kim this is unclear. But these words were actually what gave me the confidence to translate her poems and be able to feel more comfortable in translating her poems that were so personal and abundant in intense emotions.</p>

<em><p>“<span lang= ""ko"">꿈을 생각하는 시간들이 많았다</span>.”</p>
<p>“I’ve had much time to think about dreams.”</p></em>

<p>At the end of the first day we met in person, she handed me the stickers she had laid out on the table prior to our conversation. “Play with them. Stick them on whatever you want. Make designs. Create words. It’s fun, I promise.” She explained to me that these little, adhesive glitter pieces of plastic were what helped her get out of her depression. She says these stickers gave her the ability to relax, to stay excited, and to hope.</p>
<p>Every Saturday since we met months back, we’ve been meeting at Buono Buono. She, as my teacher in poetry, the literary world, and in life. And me, as her coffee barista teacher, teaching her how to make hand drip so that she too, may be able to bring the presence of coffee wherever she goes and to whoever she meets.</p>
<p>Kim has now released her second poetry book, <em>The Woman of Terrace</em>, in April, containing the English translations of her poetry both written by her daughter, Soo Yeon Kim, and by me. From sharing the book to people such as local jewelry shop owners, customers of our coffee shop, professors of various universities, and other fellow poets, Kim hopes to be able to extend her thoughts and feelings to more people.</p>
<p>I believe both Kim and I share the same hope that our readers too, can find time in their lives to think about their dreams and not be afraid to be a bit clumsy, a bit humble, a bit confused, and a bit daring. It’s not normal you see a 5-foot-8-inch twenty-four-year-old American and a five-foot, sixty-three-year-old Korean, but it was through certain aspirations that we were able to develop a connection. So thank you to poetry, to languages, and to <em>DoubleSpeak</em> for once again allowing me to discover warmth and hope.</p>",,,Korean,ko,,,,,2021,musing
xxv,XXV.,XXV.,Osip Mandelstam,Elizabeth Balabayev,"Возьми на радость из моих ладоней
Немного солнца и немного меда,
Как нам велели пчелы Персефоны.

Не отвязать неприкрепленной лодки,
Не услыхать в меха обутой тени,
Не превозмочь в дремучей жизни страха.

Нам остаются только поцелуи,
Мохнатые, как маленькие пчелы,
Что умирают, вылетев из улья.

Они шуршат в прозрачных дебрях ночи,
Их родина — дремучий лес Тайгета,
Их пища — время, медуница, мята.

Возьми ж на радость дикий мой подарок,
Невзрачное сухое ожерелье
Из мертвых пчел, мед превративших в солнце.

1920
Осип Мандельштам","Take from my palms with delight
A patch of sunshine and a touch of honey, 
As decreed by Persephone’s bees.

Do not untie an unmoored boat,
Do not listen for fur-shod shadows, 
Do not try to overcome a dense life of fear. 

All that remains for us are kisses —
Furry like small bees
who die after leaving the hive. 

They rustle in the transparent, wild night,
Their home — the dense forests of Taygete,
Their nectar — time, Pulmonaria, mint.

Just take with delight my savage gift,
A plain necklace of her dried bees,
Honey transformed into light. 

1920
Osip Mandelstam","<p>In “XXV,” I really wanted to do more with mythology because it should be noted that this poem appears in both <em>Tristia</em> (1922) and <span lang= ""ru""><em>Вторая Книга</em></span> (<em>Second Book</em>, 1923), which were written during Mandelstam’s exile in Crimea. <em>Tristia</em> refers to Ovid’s Tristia, who was also exiled from Rome to the Crimea. I added the word “her” in the penultimate line and changed “Taygetos” to “Taygete” in order to highlight neoclassical themes. Mandelstam intersperses rhyming couplets throughout the poem, but it’s nearly impossible to recreate a rhyme scheme in another language. I relied on internal rhyme, slant rhyme, and some end rhymes to somewhat capture that effect. I also ran into a problem with “Pulmonaria,” which is <span lang= ""ru""><em>медуница</em></span> (“medutsina”) in Russian, and sounds similar to “honey” (<span lang= ""ru""><em>мёд</em></span> or “meyod”). The obvious choice would have been “honeysuckle,” which I’ve seen in other translations, but I wanted to create a connection between Persephone at the beginning of the poem by capitalizing Pulmonaria. Pulmonaria is commonly called lungwort, and is used to treat asthma and bronchitis in folk remedies. It is a small, purple flower; the name partially betrays its color. It’s a shade-loving plant and, along with the color, creates an echo of Persephone’s dark underworld- and pomegranate-stained hands.</p>","<p>Osip Mandelstam was born in Warsaw, Poland, Russian Empire, on January 14, 1891. His family moved to St. Petersburg soon after and he was educated at the prestigious Tenishev School, where Pushkin attended. He then studied at the Sorbonne in Paris, the University of Heidelburg, and the University of St. Petersburg, converting from Judaism to Methodism so that he could attend the latter. He was a founding member of the Poets Guild, with Gumilev, Akhmatova, and Gorodetsky, which created the Acmeist movement in Russian poetry. His poetry collections include <span lang= ""ru""><em>Каминь</em></span> (<em>Stone</em>, 1913), <em>Trista</em> (1922), <span lang= ""ru""><em>Вторая Книга</em></span> (<em>Second Book</em>, 1923), as well as essays, short prose, and literary criticism in <em>The Noise of Time</em> and <em>Feodosiya</em> (both 1925) and <em>The Egyptian Stamp</em> (1928). He also worked as a translator. In 1934 he was arrested for his poem, “Stalin Epigram,” and was sent to a transit camp in Vladivostok. Later, he was exiled with his wife, Nadezhda, to Cherdyn in the Northern Urals. Mandelstam was arrested a second time during Stalin’s Great Terror and was sent back to Vladivostok, where he died on December 27, 1938, of starvation.</p>","<p>Elizabeth Balabayev studies English literature and creative writing (C’21). She studied Russian at Penn and Bryn Mawr’s Russian Language Institute. She also studied in Germany and speaks fluent German. Her poetry focuses on technology and the environment, but her plays and screenwriting draw from history and women’s stories. She is from Texas, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, and considers herself both Southern and Northern. Her family is American and Russian.</p>",Russian,ru,,,"<div>

the-city,Byen,The City,Sigbjørn Obstfelder,Jordan Barger,"Jeg bor i fjeldet. 
I uger har jeg ikke set et menneske, 
ikke hørt min egen røst. 
Jeg hører mig selv tænke, 
mens tjernet skvulper. 
Røde skyer drager forbi. 
Det mørknes, 
fjeldvandet blir sort, lommen skriger. 
Der farer en angst igjennem mig. 
Hvor er de nu alle? Hvad gjør de? 
Lever de end nu? Lever mine brødre, 
menneskene?
Og fjeldet blir pludselig så isnende koldt. 
Det har intet hjerte. 
Jeg må ned, bag den borteste blåne, 
søndenfor de brede sletter, 
der hvor hjerter slår, 
der hvor tusender hjerter slår i kor. 
Jeg iler til dalen, 
jeg gjemmer mig i kupeen. 
Hele natten pruster jernvognen, 
lyner afsted i mulm og mørke, 
gjennem lange, dybe dale, 
over brede sletter. 
Næste aften står jeg på den stenlagte gade. 
Der er ingen skog lenger, 
men huse og huse og vinduer, 
ingen sus gjennem blade, 
men surren af vogne, 
larm af utallige fødder. 
Langt borte hører jeg et forfærdeligt skrig. 
Hvem lider? 
Jeg løber efter skriget. 
Og jeg hører ud fra åbne 
vinduer en brølende røst: 
«Forfærdes, I mænd og kvinder, 
I rådne kar, Eders skiddenhed 
er værre end øglers, 
Eders synder er utallige 
som havets sand. – – 
Angst løber jeg videre. 
Jeg kømmer forbi et hus, 
hvor der er mange mennesker. 
Jeg ser dem sidde langs væggene, 
de snakker ikke til hinanden, 
de smiler ikke til hinanden. 
Og jeg blir mer og mer angst.
Jeg kømmer forbi dansebuler 
med mænd og kvinder, 
der sparker hinanden tilblods. 
Er dette mine brødre, menneskene? 
Jeg løber videre og videre. 
Jeg blir mere og mere angst. 
Ingen taler til hinanden, 
ingen smiler til hinanden. 
De farer afsted, som var de piskede, 
og ud fra de små huse hører 
jeg gråt og hulken,
bag mig gråter det, gråter, gråter… 
Og omsider går det op før mig, 
omsider ser jeg det: 
De er vanvittige, 
de piskes af sin egen skygge. 
Og jeg ser mig om, 
jeg ser på deres øine, 
deres miner, deres ilen og løben: 
Ja, de er vanvittige, de er vanvittige. ","I live in the mountain. 
I have not seen another person in weeks, 
nor heard my own voice. 
While the pond ripples I can hear myself think.
Red clouds pass by. 
The sky darkens, 
the mountain water blackens, the loon cries.
Fear spreads through me. 
Where are they now? What are they doing? 
Are they still alive? Are my brothers still living, 
anybody?
And the mountain suddenly 
becomes icy cold. Its heart is gone.
I must go down, 
back to the blue horizon, 
southward where the plains stretch out, 
where beating hearts reside, 
where a thousand hearts beat in chorus.
I spring down the valley, 
I hide myself away in a compartment. 
The wagon creaks the whole night, 
lightning strikes off in the gloom and darkness, 
the plains stretch across the deep, long valley.
The next evening, 
I stand in the cobblestone street. 
There is no longer a forest, 
but windows and house after house, 
no whistling through the leaves, 
just the buzz of carts, 
the noise of countless feet.
Far off, I hear a terrible scream. 
Who is that suffering?
I run after the scream. 
And from the open windows, 
I hear a roaring voice:
‘Terrible! You men and women, 
you rotten people, you are filthier than lizards. 
Your sins are as countless as sand on the beach.’ – –
I run on in fear. 
I go past a house filled with people. 
I see them sitting along the walls, 
they do not speak to each other, 
they do not smile at each other.
And I am filled with more and more fear. 
I go past a dance-joint teeming 
with men and women, 
kicking each other bloody.
Are these my brothers, these people?
I ran farther and farther. 
I am filled with more and more fear. 
They do not speak to each other; 
they do not smile at each other.
They flit about as if whipped, 
and from a small house 
I hear crying and sobbing, 
behind me they are crying, crying, crying…
And at last this all wells up inside me, 
at last I say: 
‘They are mad! 
They are whipped by their own shadow!’ 
I look them in the eye, 
see their expressions,
see them rushing and running about, 
and I say to myself: 
‘Yes, they are mad, they are mad!’","<p>“The City” is a prose poem by Sigbjørn Obstfelder, the father of Norwegian modernist poetry. This poem is an exceptionally good example of his work because it depicts the anxiety of Norway’s transition from a rural, pastoral society to an industrialized, modern nation. We see a country-dwelling Norwegian decide to make his way into town for a wholesome reason, only to experience an anxiety attack similar to that portrayed in Munch’s <em>Scream</em>.</p>
<p>The work of Obstfelder is challenging to translate today because of the interlingual nature of late nineteenth-century Norway. Still a young nation at the time, Norway was heavily Danish but was emerging as modern Bokmål. Beyond that, stylistically, Obstfelder has a jerky, hyphenated style that says much with few words. The former reveals his nervous nature and the latter puts him firmly in the Norwegian tradition.</p>","<p>Sigbjørn Obstfelder (21 November 1866–29 July 1900) was a nineteenth-century Norwegian writer, a close friend of Edvard Munch, an inspiration to Rainier Maria Rilke, and the father of modernist Norwegian poetry. His poem “Jeg Ser” is known by all Norwegians and mimics the sense of alienation depicted in Munch’s famous painting <em>The Scream.</em></p>
<p>In 1890, Obstfelder moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but after only a year, he had a nervous breakdown and returned to Norway. After several years of moving around with the Norwegian intellectual scene, he died of tuberculosis at the age of thirty-three on the same day as the birth of his only child Lili.</p>",<p>Jordan Barger is a Philadelphia-based translator specializing in translations from Norwegian and French. He has worked in Norway at the Ivar Aasen Center in Ørsta. He translated Sigbjørn Obstfelder’s 1894 novel <em>The Cross</em>.

For example, <em>de couver</em> in the line “de couver mon sommeil éternel” translates most directly to “to wrap a child in cotton wool.” I tried to preserve this notion through the use of the word “swathe,” which similarly refers to the idea of wrapping a baby in fabric. I also struggled with the line “to care not to hide.” This translation originally did not make much sense to me within the context of the poem, so I tried many different versions and arrangements. However, I continued to come back to this most direct translation of Ndiaye’s words. I feel like it allows the most room for interpretation of her meaning without my own personal inputs. I maintain her punctuation, line breaks, and structure throughout the entire poem, along with the repetition of “When I Die.”</p>
<p>Three years ago, I translated the poem “Femme Noir” by Léopold Senghor for the 2018 edition of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>. When I found this poem by Ndiaye, I felt that it was a near perfect follow-up to my first translation, as it offers both a call to arms and love for Black women (specifically those from Africa) from the perspective of a Black woman. I tried my best to maintain the high-energy and fast-paced nature of the poem in my translation by keeping the lines to a similar length and retaining the same punctuation and structure. I also chose to translate all of the lines starting with <em>femme</em> as “Women of” to add repetition to the poem to keep it moving forward. I also tried to as closely as possible preserve the meanings of the more descriptive words like <em>crépitements</em>, which directly translates to “the crackling of machine guns.” However, I chose to use the word “sputter” in my translation because I felt it more accurately captured in English the sound she was trying to evoke. Similarly, while <em>ni decolorées</em> literally translates to “neither faded,” the line was difficult to translate as there is no meaningful English equivalent to this use of the past tense. I opted to use the phrase “left to fade,” as I believe it more accurately captures the feeling of the original line. Finally, I sifted through several different English translation of the line: “VIVE L’AFRIQUE LIBRE” (“long live free Africa,” “God bless free Africa,” etc.), but ultimate settled on translating <em>libre</em> as “liberated” as it felt like it carried the most nuanced understanding of what it means for Africa and Black women to be free.</p>","<p>Mariam Ndiaye is a Senegalese poet and politician. Unfortunately, this was the extent of the information I was able to find about her through the Internet. These poems were sourced from an anthology of Senegalese poetry published by the Senegalese Center of PEN International.</p>","<p>Donnisa Edmonds is a recent graduate of the University of Pennsylvania who is currently working as a neuroscience researcher trying to understand how we use our brains to make decisions. She was born in the Bronx, New York, but grew up in a small college town in Ohio. She has been studying French since high school and is struggling to maintain fluency in a post-college lifestyle. Her hobbies include sewing, roller skating, excessive visits to the craft store, and discussing music opinions with anyone who will listen.</p>",French,fr,,,"<div>

wild-grass,"<span lang=""zh"">《野草》题辞 </span>",Wild Grass,Lu Xun,Chardonnay Needler,"当我沉默着的时候，我觉得充实；
我将开口，同时感到空虚 。 

过去的生命已经死亡。我对于这死亡有大欢喜，
因为我借此知道它曾经存活。
死亡的生命已经朽腐。我对于这朽腐有大欢喜，
因为我借此知道它还非空虚。 
生命的泥委弃在地面上，不生乔木，
只生野草，这是我的罪过。 

野草，根本不深，花叶不美，
然而吸取露，吸取水，
吸取陈死人的血和肉，
各各夺取它的生存。
当生存时，还是将遭践踏，
将遭删刈，直至于死亡而朽腐。 
但我坦然，欣然。
我将大笑，我将歌唱。 

我自爱我的野草，
但我憎恶这以野草作装饰的地面。 

地火在地下运行，奔突；
熔岩一旦喷出，将烧尽一切野草，
以及乔木，于是并且无可朽腐。
但我坦然，欣然。我将大笑，我将歌唱。 

天地有如此静穆，我不能大笑而且歌唱。
天地即不如此静穆，我或者也将不能。
我以这一丛野草，在明与暗，生与死，
过去与未来之际，献于友与仇，人与兽，
爱者与不爱者之前作证。 

为我自己，为友与仇，
人与兽，爱者与不爱者，
我希望这野草的死亡与朽腐，火速到来。
要不然，我先就未曾生存，
这实在比死亡与朽腐更其不幸。 
去罢，野草，连着我的题辞！","When I’m quiet, I feel complete; 
I then open my mouth, 
simultaneously feeling empty. 

The past life has already died. 
With respect to its death, 
I am overjoyed, 
for from its death I know 
that it once was alive. 

This dead life has already rotted. 
With respect to its decomposition, 
I am overjoyed, as from its rotting 
I know that it has not been empty. 
The sludge of life drips on the earth, 
but it doesn’t nourish forests, 
only bears wild grass, this is my fault. 

Wild grass — doesn’t run deep, 
doesn’t have pretty flowers or leaves, 
but rather sucks up dew, sucks up water, 
sucks up old remains of the blood and flesh of the dead, 
each form trying to take life from it. 

When it was living, 
it’d be tread upon and 
cut down until it’d die and rot. 

But I’m at ease, happy. 
I’ll laugh, I’ll sing. 

I love my wild grass, 
but I scorn this ground 
that’s adorned in wild grass.
 
The fires under the earth are moving, running wild; 
once the fire erupts, 
it will consume all the wild grass and the tall trees, 
such that nothing will be left to rot. 

But I’m at ease, happy. 
I’ll laugh, I’ll sing.
 
Heaven and earth are so silent, 
and so I can’t laugh or sing. 

If heaven and earth weren’t so silent, 
I probably still couldn’t do these things. 

I — caught between light and darkness, life and death, 
past and present — dedicate as a testimony 
this bunch of wild grass 
to friends and enemies, 
man and beast, 
those I love and those I don’t love. 

For myself, for friends and enemies, 
man and beast, 
those I love and those I do not: 
I hope this wild grass’ destruction and decay come quickly.
If not, I will not have lived at all; this, in actuality, 
is even more pitiful than dying and decaying. 

Go now, wild grass, along with my epigraph!","<p>I debated a lot about whether or not to change the punctuation to something more widely accepted (no run ons, fragments, etc.), but to honor Lu Xun and his legacy of spearheading the vernacular movement in the early twentieth century, I figured I should make it as conversational as possible. This meant preserving — for the most part — fragments and unorthodox comma rules, as well as keeping vocabulary and sentence structures at a very colloquial level. His poem is very conversational, and thus I opted for the use of contractions, such as “I’ll” instead of “I shall” or even “I will” for <span lang= ""zh"">我将</span>, among others.</p>
<p>Secondly, a note on why I veered away from a literal word choice: <span lang= ""zh"">吸取</span> literally translates to “absorb,” but I wanted to make the verb more active to personify the grass. Also, I felt that “absorb” wasn’t active enough to be used thrice in a row with the same biting tone the poem had — it dulled the energy. “Sucking” seemed good because the character <span lang= ""zh"">吸</span> is also used in the word for “straw,” <span lang= ""zh"">吸管</span>, and the image Lu presents in his poem is incredibly visceral while simultaneously whimsical. “Consume” felt too formal given Lu’s insistence on vernacular writing throughout his career.</p>
<p>As for the title of the poem, it is typically translated as “The Foreword,” for it is both a poem as well as the foreword of Lu’s eponymous poetry book, <em>Wild Grass</em>. Since this is a standalone piece, I figured I should give it a standalone name. As for the tone, I tried to keep it ambivalent, as Lu Xun premises his book with this very morbid yet also playful introduction.</p>","<p>Lu Xun (<span lang= ""zh"">鲁迅</span>) (1881–1936, birth name: Zhou Shuren <span lang= ""zh"">周树人</span>) is one of the most important — if not the most influential — early twentieth-century Chinese literati figures and essayists. Originally on a pre-med track, the Shaoxing, Zhejiang, native dropped out of Japanese medical school to pursue literature and heal his country with culture. One of the founding names of the modern Chinese vernacular movement, Lu sought to popularize poetry and novels that were written in the language the people spoke (<em>baihua wen</em>), instead of the antiquated Classical Chinese that employed gatekeeping grammatical structures and vocabulary. This made him one of the most popular of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>He is adored by revolutionaries of all factions and flavors — from Chairman Mao to dissidents — and was politically ambiguous even though he was a definite Leftist. To illustrate this, he was the head of Shanghai’s League of Left-Wing Writers, but when the Chinese Communist Party asked him to write a novel of the communist revolution in rural China, he declined. He, along with other early twentieth-century Chinese writers, popularized writing about problems that plagued the common man, akin to the Realist movement of Gustave Flaubert and Émile Zola.</p>
<p>Some of his other famous and amazing Chinese vernacular pieces are the short stories <span lang= ""zh"">《狂人日记》</span> (“A Madman’s Diary”) and <span lang= ""zh"">《阿Q正传》</span> (“A True Story of Ah Q”).</p>","<p>Chardonnay Needler is just a scatterbrained person who likes languages. A sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania, she’s studying international relations and either Chinese or linguistics. She speaks and reads English, French, and Mandarin, and can barely get by in Japanese, Spanish, and Zulu. She loves examining the sociopolitical aspects of words and why they are chosen, which she was able to do in greater detail this past summer on a PURM project analyzing South African musicians’ and activists’ use of translanguaging in song. The next language on her list is German, to get back in touch with her German-Jewish roots and read Hannah Arendt’s pieces in their original language.</p>",Chinese,zh,,,"<div>

","<p>Once Black Lives Matter movements occurred in 2020, I realized I hadn’t yet done anything for the movement itself. As a Black poet myself, I knew I had to make a difference. Thus, this poem seemed to be the ideal way for me to make a personal contribution, given all that was happening in the world.</p>
<p>“Eclipse” has no punctuation marks at all, mostly due to the fact that Portuguese is a fairly fluid language. Since it is virtually impossible to understand the poem without punctuation marks in English, I did have to include certain commas, exclamation points and question marks to maintain its consistency and create a balance.</p>
<p>The poem talks about a man who was brought to the Americas as a slave and sought to rediscover his own personality and cultural dignity which was lost to the new way of life imposed upon him. Therefore, it was crucial to retain a questioning tone that reflects his identity, and so I found it important to write down question marks when needed.</p>
<p>The notions of both hope and despair occur throughout the poem, so adding commas was necessary for the English version, because this juxtaposition is inherent to the message the author wishes to convey.</p>
","<p>Carlos de Assumpção (1927–) is a Brazilian author who mainly writes anti-racist poetry that promotes a greater inclusion of Black literature. A grandson of former slaves, he has employed literature as a form of activism for nearly seven decades, and his words of protest proclaiming racial equality have achieved national recognition. Assumpção’s writings evoke a colloquial, yet concrete, vernacular form of speech.</p>","<p>Pedro Lino is a senior majoring in history at São Paulo State University, Brazil. He is a true “logophile” (someone who loves words) and a polyglot who doesn’t talk all that often, but sure does translate a lot. Although he occasionally tries to stop writing, he just can’t seem to do so.</p>
<p>You can find some of Pedro’s poems at <em>eMerge</em>, the magazine of the Writers Colony House at Dairy Hollow.</p>

transfigured-night,Verklärte Nacht,Transfigured Night,Richard Dehmel,Jonathan Iwry,"Zwei Menschen gehn durch kahlen, kalten Hain;
der Mond läuft mit, sie schaun hinein.
Der Mond läuft über hohe Eichen;
kein Wölkchen trübt das Himmelslicht,
in das die schwarzen Zacken reichen.
Die Stimme eines Weibes spricht:

“Ich trag ein Kind, und nit von Dir,
ich geh in Sünde neben Dir.
Ich hab mich schwer an mir vergangen.
Ich glaubte nicht mehr an ein Glück
und hatte doch ein schwer Verlangen
nach Lebensinhalt, nach Mutterglück

und Pflicht; da hab ich mich erfrecht,
da ließ ich schaudernd mein Geschlecht
von einem fremden Mann umfangen,
und hab mich noch dafür gesegnet.
Nun hat das Leben sich gerächt:
nun bin ich Dir, o Dir, begegnet.”

Sie geht mit ungelenkem Schritt.
Sie schaut empor; der Mond läuft mit.
Ihr dunkler Blick ertrinkt in Licht.
Die Stimme eines Mannes spricht:

“Das Kind, das Du empfangen hast,
sei Deiner Seele keine Last,
o sieh, wie klar das Weltall schimmert!
Es ist ein Glanz um alles her;
Du treibst mit mir auf kaltem Meer,
doch eine eigne Wärme flimmert
von Dir in mich, von mir in Dich.

Die wird das fremde Kind verklären,
Du wirst es mir, von mir gebären;
Du hast den Glanz in mich gebracht,
Du hast mich selbst zum Kind gemacht.”
Er faßt sie um die starken Hüften.
Ihr Atem küßt sich in den Lüften.
Zwei Menschen gehn durch hohe, helle Nacht.","Two people walk the cold, bare woods; 
The moon keeps up with light that floods. 
The moon moves over oak trees high; 
Below, the black and jagged tips 
Reach up into a cloudless sky. 
A woman’s voice escapes her lips: 

“I carry a child, and not by you.
I walk here, sinful, next to you. 
Against myself I have conspired. 
I’d given up on all that’s good, 
Yet heavily I still desired
A life fulfilled, of motherhood  

And duty. So in my disgrace, 
I gave myself to the embrace, 
Shuddering, of a strange man — 
And thought it was a blessing, too. 
Now life has taken its revenge: 
Now here you are, now I’ve met you.”

Uncertainly, she stumbles on.
She looks above; she sees the moon. 
Her dark gaze drowns in light oblique.
A man’s voice begins to speak:

“Don’t let this child conceived in thee
Upon your soul a burden be. 
Look, how the world is shining bright, 
Glory cast on everything! 
A cold sea we are traveling, 
But warmly glows an inner light 
From you in me, from me in you.

That warmth will make this child shine,
And you will bear him as if mine. 
That glow upon me you invite; 
You’ve filled me with a child’s delight.”
His arm around her sturdy hips, 
Their breaths upon each other’s lips, 
Two people walk the high, bright night.","<p>“Verklärte Nacht,” written in 1896, is considered to be one of Richard Dehmel’s most memorable works — and in turn inspired Arnold Schoenberg to write one of his most well-known compositions in 1889. The poem depicts a man and woman as they walk through the forest; the woman confesses to carrying another man’s child, the man forgives her and welcomes the coming child as his own, and, in keeping with the poem’s title, the night is “transfigured.”</p>
<p>Although other English translations of this poem already exist, I wanted to translate the poem in such a way as to preserve its original formal qualities — specifically, its meter and rhyme scheme. The ninth line of the original, in which the female speaker describes her desire to experience motherhood, translates to “I had a heavy longing.” The original word, <em>schwer</em>, which means both “heavy” and “burdensome,” seems to serve as a play on words evoking the notion of pregnancy. The poet appears to use pregnancy as a metaphor for the woman’s burdensome longing to become a mother, describing her longing as a heavy weight she carries. I chose to translate the word to “heavy” to convey both the weight of the speaker’s longing and the physical encumbrance of pregnancy — as in the English phrase “heavy with child.”</p>","<p>Richard Dehmel is considered one of the greatest German poets of the period before the First World War. Despite his support for Germany’s war effort — as well as his decision to enlist in the German army in 1914 — Dehmel expressed strong progressive values throughout his career. He clashed with conservative poets, advocated for workers’ rights, and frequently portrayed love, sex, and eroticism in his poetry, for which he was prosecuted for blasphemy and obscenity on multiple occasions. His work embodied the cultural contradictions and historical juxtapositions of their author, contrasting frank depictions of sexuality and social issues with flawless execution of the conservative formal conventions of the time.</p>","<p>Jonathan Iwry graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> from the University of Pennsylvania with a BA in philosophy and history. He does occasional translations in memory of his grandmother, Nina Rochman Iwry, who did translations before the Second World War. In addition to speaking Hebrew, he has been teaching himself German over the course of the pandemic; this is his first translation from German into English.</p>",German,de,,,"<div>

Estoy sola,
muy sola,
entre mi cintura y mi vestido,
sola entre mi voz entera,
con una carga de ángeles menudos
como esas caricias
que se desploman solas en los dedos.
Entre mi pelo, a la deriva,
un remero azul,
confundido,
busca un niño de arena.
Sosteniendo sus tribus de olores
con un hilo pálido,
contra un perfil de rosa,
en el rincón más quieto de mis párpados
trece peregrinos se agolpan.

pero ahora que no me llame nadie,
que no quepo en la voz de nadie,
que no me llamen,
porque estoy bajando al fondo de mi pequeñez,
a la raíz complacida de mi sombra,
porque ahora estoy bajando al agónico
tacto de un minero, con su media flor al hombro,
y una gran letra de te quiero al cinto.
Y bajo más,
a las inmediaciones del aire
que aligerado espera las letras de su nombre
para nacer perfecto y habitable.

I am alone,
very alone,
between my waist and my dress,
alone among my entire voice,
with a charge of fragile angels
like those caresses
that collapse by themselves in the fingers.
In my hair, adrift,
a blue rower,
confused,
seeks a boy of sand.
Holding his tribes of smells
with a pale thread,
against a silhouette of roses,
in the quietest corner of my eyelids
thirteen pilgrims jostle against each other.

over my heart of stone in bloom
to see it,
to tailor his arteries and my voice
in a given moment
in that someone comes,
and calls me…
but now please no one call me,
I no longer fit in anyone’s voice,
please no one call me,
because I am sinking to the depths of my smallness,
to the satisfied root of my shadow,
because now I am descending to the agonizing
touch of a miner, with his half flower at the shoulder,
and a great letter of I want you at the waist.
And I fall farther,
into the immediacies of the air
that lightened awaits the letters of his name
to be born perfect and inhabitable.
Lower,
I descend much more,
who will find me?
I wear my arteries
(what great haste I have),
I wear my arteries and my voice,
I don my heart of stone in bloom,
so that in a given moment
someone would come,
and call for me,
and I won’t be
lightly arched over my heart, to see it.
and I won’t have to go and leave my great voice,
and my high heart
of stone in bloom.","<p>Throughout her entire <em>oeuvre</em>, Odio plays with similar themes. In her earlier work, Odio analyzes the relationship between the lover and the beloved. In later poems, Odio will go on to explore the relationship between the creator and the created. In Odio’s mind, creation is linked to sacred poetic language, which engenders a new reality. Hence, throughout her poetry, Odio includes biblical allusions, such as the “thirteen pilgrims.” She also plays with common epic tropes, such as embarking on a descending journey to bring healing and order in many poems, including <em>Declinaciones del monólogo</em> and <em>El tránsito de fuego: Parte II</em>. The erotic, as seen in <em>Declinaciones del monólogo</em>, plays a central role in Odio’s poetry. Through the erotic, Odio discusses the relationship between sexuality, the poetic body, and existential awareness. By touching upon the physical, she also transgresses the limits of conventional love poetry, becoming at once incredibly avant-garde yet also completely rooted in her humanity.</p>
<p>In two parts of Declinaciones del monólogo, Odio writes of <em>calzarme,</em> be it “calzarme sus arterias y mi voz” or “me calzo mis arterias (y mi voz).” <em>Calzar</em> brings two images to my mind: fitting feet into shoes or fitting puzzle pieces together. In the first rendition of “calzarme sus arterias y mi voz,” the lyric “I” speaks of fitting disparate pieces together, of his and of mine, a combination that cannot last. She is also speaking of it passively, in the infinitive form. In this spirit, the image of tailoring these two pieces together came to me: they will synthetically fit on the lyric “I,” but not organically. In the second use of “me calzo mis arterias y mi voz,” the lyric “I” takes agency over her own veins and voice, reflected in the conjugated verb form. I highlight this evolution in agency by translating <em>me calzo</em> this time as “I wear.” Immediately below, I translate <em>me pongo</em> as “I don,” which is both a literal translation (albeit a rather old-fashioned one) and a translingual pun — in Spanish, <em>don</em> is an honorific derived from Latin <em>dominus</em>, master of a household. In this context, <em>don</em> places additional emphasis on the mastery of the lyric “I” over herself.</p>
<p>In Spanish, you can express a desire in a commanding tone by using constructions like “que no me llamen.” In translating this forceful wish into English, I thought of it as “please no one call me,” highlighting the vulnerability and intensity of the lyric “I.”</p>
The most common translation of “I like you” into Spanish is <em>te quiero</em> — to me, it is also one of the most careless. <em>Te quiero</em> connotes “I want you” and “I’m fond of you.” In attempting to transmit Odio’s erotic spirit as well as this poem’s struggle between love and independence, I opted for the “I want you” variation.</p>
<p>In all her poems, Odio plays with the different genders words have in Spanish. In this poem, the salient example is <i>el aire</i>, “the (masculine) air.” He links the human with the eternal: immediate, waiting, and about to become reborn. A counterpart to the lyric “I,” a masculine to her feminine. Thus, I emphasized the air’s masculinity in my translation (“the letters of <strong>his</strong> name”), subtly alluded to in the original through Odio’s purposeful use of <i>de <strong>l</strong> aire</i> as opposed to a possible <i>de aire</i> (deliberately including the implied masculine “l”), and the gendered adjectives <em>aligerad<strong>o</strong></em> and <em>perfect<strong>o</strong></em>.</p> ","<p>Eunice Odio (1919–1974) detested biographies. “The affairs of my private life are the most private and, in general, no one knows them, except me.” Even so, I will attempt to provide a brief sketch of Odio’s lives — both the inner poetic life she constructed and the outer tragedy she lived — to better color her work.</p>
<p>Octavio Paz once told Odio that she was “of that line of poets who invent their own mythology, like Blake, like St. John Perse, like Ezra Pound; and they are rubbed out, because no one understands them until years or even centuries after their death.” And as mythological Odio’s writing certainly is: she plays with language and gender and reality, often relaying her own mystical experiences in her poetry, inspired by old epics.</p>
<p>Odio’s biography is impossible to extricate from her own personal mythology. For the longest time, scholars believed her birth year to have been 1922, perhaps due to Odio’s coquetry, until it was discovered that Odio had in fact been born in 1919. Her own death is even further shrouded in mystery: she was found ten days after her death, alone, in her bathtub in Mexico sometime in 1974; the exact date is uncertain. Suspicions as to how she died abound: suicide by venom, an accidental slip in the tub, assassination. The one certainty from Odio’s life is that she migrated from Costa Rica northward, seeking a home for her fierce individuality and expression. She never found it.</p>
","<p>Couloir X. Hanson is a daughter of three worlds: Costa Rica, Germany, and the United States. Her favorite authors are magical realists, like Juan Rulfo and Julio Cortázar and Gabriel García Márquez — authors who challenge objective reality. Couloir first read Eunice Odio when writing her high school thesis partially on Odio’s <em>Tercer poema (Consumación)</em> and has been haunted by Odio’s mythological poetry ever since. In her free time, Couloir enjoys picking wildflowers, playing chess, and singing opera. After graduating from Penn, Couloir will work in real estate, where she hopes to use her whimsy to see what is and imagine what could be.</p>",Spanish,es,,,"<div>

a-letter-of-menakhem-mendl,מכתב של מנחם-מנדל,A Letter of Menakhem-Mendl,Nathan Alterman,Dan Ben-Amos,"שינה שינדל שלי, זוגתי היפה,
בין עבים הלבנה נוגהת.
שינה שינדל שלי, דרך ליל וסופה
בראשי החולם את נוגעת.

בקפוטה שלי רוח ליל ממרט
ושמוט כובעי עלי ערף ממצח.
כך הלכתי חיים, כך שוכב אני מת,
כי דמותי---כך אומרים ---היא בת-נצח.

שינה שינדל שלי, יורד שלג לבן,
אין אדם. כלם תמו. הביני.
טוביה מת
ומת מוטל בן פיסי החזן.
מת האיש היקר הדוד פיני.

ועל השלג נח סטמפניו, קט ויחף,
וכלו כמאז מלא חן עוד.
אך אלם הכנור. לא נגון הוא רועף.
יען אין לו למי לנגן עוד.

וגם טופלה נח, טוטוריטו התם
נח פעוט ומחיך ממות.
נצחיים הם שחוקו ובכיו של העם.
לכן טופלה הוא בן-אלמות.

שינה שינדל שלי. לילה, לילה עמק.
את זוכרת הליל בו נפרדנו.
עם העם שנתנו לו דמע ושחוק
גם אנחנו מול מות עמדנו.

את לבשת, שינה שינדל, מטפחת של חג.
את נקית הקפוטה שלי הנושנת.
והעם זאת הפעם צחוק לא צחק.
הוא נשק את ידך הקורנת.

והלילה היה משרפות חכלילי
ואני צואה לך נסחתי,
על אגרת קטנה, שינה שינדל שלי.
וברור כי עקר שכחתי.

העקר...לך רציתי תודה להגיד,
שהיית לי בת-זוג, סבלנית ומכפרת.
שינה שינדל, שחקנו קומדיה נצחית,
אך גמרנו אחרת, אחרת.

זאת נבאה בדיחתנו מאז,טרם סוף,
עת נגנו כנוריה בתוך הלע
היא על לב גבוריה הכתה באגרוף ,
אבל איש לא אבה לשמע.

גם אני לא ידעתי, גם את לא הבנת,
את חזיון התוגה ששחקנו עד ערב.
שום ספרות---כך יאמרו---לא ידעה קומדינט
שכמונו נשא על צואר את החרב.

עד יום גזר...עד נצבנו בתוך הגולה,
אבירי החלום, גאוני העני,
גבורי הספרות היהודית הגדולה,
הנופלת בשלג כמוני.

--- --- שינה שינדל שלי, דרף ליל וסופה
בראשי ההרוג את נוגעת.
שינה שינדל שלי, זוגתי היפה
במרומים הלבנה נוגהת.","My lovely wife Sheyne-Sheyndl,
Through a cloud the moon is shining.  
Through storm and night, you handle 
My dreamy head, gently patting. 
 
The mighty wind blows up my capota
My hat drops to the back of my head.
Like that I walked alive, like that I lie dead
Since my figure, so they say, is immortal.

My Sheyne-Sheyndl, it is snowing white.
Not a soul, all are gone, face it.
Tevye died 
And Motl died too, the son of cantor Peyse,
Uncle Pinye, dear man, is dead too. 

Stempenyu on the snow cradles, small and barefoot,
Charming as ever and more.
But his fiddle is silent, no sound no hoot 
All are gone, all who listened before.

Topeleh too is resting, simple-minded tuturitu 
The toddler is resting dead and smiling. 
People’s jokes and tears are immortal, 
So immortal is Topeleh too.

My Sheyne-Sheyndl, do you remember
Deep, deep was the night we parted,
In line we stood facing death together
With whom in tears and laughs we delighted.

Sheyne-Sheyndl you wore your holiday shawl,
My tattered capota you tried to mend.
This time our people did not laugh, not at all,
They just kissed your glowing hand.

The night turned scarlet from flames,
And for you, my will I wrote 
On a small piece of paper with your name.
And, sure enough, the main point I forgot.

I wanted to thank you, so much and no less
For being a patient, forgiving wife
Sheyne-Sheyndl, we played our life
For a laugh, but the finish was something else.

Our joke foretold this end from the start, 
Playing silent music in us, inside.
We pounded our heroes at their heart
But nobody listened or cared to mind.

I did not know and you did not get
The sad drama we played till too late.
No lit., so they say, has a jester tell jokes
While a hangman’s noose his neck chokes.

Till judgement day we did not exit,      
Dreamy knights and clumsy heroes,
The figures of the great Yiddish lit,
That like me in the snow wallow.

Through storm and night, Sheyne Sheyndl, 
My murdered head you are gently patting. 
My lovely wife Sheyne-Sheyndl,
In heaven the moon is shining.","<p>The poem was published in Hebrew in the newspaper <em>Davar</em> (March 9, 1945) and was included in subsequent editions of Alterman’s collected poems. The speaker in this poetic monologue is Menakhem Mendl, the protagonist of the epistolary novel <em>The Letters of Menakhem-Mendl and Sheyn-Sheyndl</em>, by Sholem Aleichem (Sholem Yakov Rabinovitz [1859–1916]), published in 1892–1913. The latest English translation is published together with a book about another figure from Sholem Aleichem’s fictional gallery who is mentioned in the poem, “The Letters of Menakhen-Mendl and Motl, the Cantor’s Son,” translated by Hillel Halkin (New Yiddish Library. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002). Uncle Pinye is also a character in this book. Stempenyu, the gifted fiddler, is the hero of Sholem Aleichem’s first novel that was published in Yiddish in 1888, and its latest English translation is by Hanna Berman (<em>Stempenyu: A Yiddish Romance</em>, [Brooklyn: Melville, 2007]). Topeleh Tuturitu is the child who narrates the tale “The Flag” in Sholem Aleichem’s stories for children, published in English as <em>A Treasury of Sholom Aleichem Children’s Stories</em>, translated by Aliza Shervin (Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson, 1996). Tevye is Tevye the Dairyman of <em>Fiddler on the Roof</em> fame, whose story was published first as <em>Tevye and his Daughters</em> in 1894, and later in English translation as <em>Tevye’s Daughters</em>, translated by Frances Butwin (New York: Crown, 1949).</p>","<p>Nathan Alterman (1910–1970) was one of the leading Hebrew poets of the twentieth century. He was awarded major literary prizes in Israel: in 1946 and 1967 he received the Tchernichovsky Prize for translating classical French plays into Hebrew, in 1947 the Ruppin Literary Prize for his second book of poems, in 1957 the Bialik Prize for Literature, and in 1968 the highest Israeli prize for literature, the Israel Prize. He became a cultural literary monument, and in 2011 the State of Israel printed his portrait on its currency.</p>
<p>Alterman began publishing topical poems in July 1934 at the age of twenty-four in <em>Davar</em> and, later, in the leading newspaper <em>Ha-Aretz</em>. During eight years with <em>Ha-Aretz</em>, he wrote about three hundred poems. In 1942, he returned to <em>Davar</em>, where he continued to publish his topical poetry. Until 1965, Alterman’s work at <em>Davar</em> was commentary in prose. In addition to his topical poetry, he published several volumes of lyrical poems, wrote poems for the theater (many of them became popular songs), translated classical plays, and wrote four plays, which were produced in Israel.</p>","<p>Dan Ben-Amos teaches folklore at the University of Pennsylvania. He earned his BA in literature from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and his doctorate degree in folklore from Indiana University. Among his books are <em>Sweet Words</em>, <em>Folklore in Context</em>, <em>Folklore Concepts</em>, and the edited volumes of <em>Folktales of the Jews</em>, <em>Folklore Genres</em>, <em>Folklore: Performance and Communication</em> (with Kenneth S. Goldstein), <em>Cultural Memory and the Construction of Identity</em> (with Liliane Weissberg), and <em>The Diary: The Epic of Everyday Life</em> (with Batsheva Ben-Amos). His translations of Alterman’s poems appeared in <em>Jewish Review of Books</em> and <em>Moment</em>.</p>",Hebrew,he,,,"<div>

i-want-to-live-with-you,"<span lang=""ru"">Я бы хотела жить с Вами</span>",I want to live with you,Marina Tsvetaeva,Wenhan Zhang,"…Я бы хотела жить с Вами
В маленьком городе,
Где вечные сумерки
И вечные колокола.
И в маленькой деревенской гостинице —
Тонкий звон
Старинных часов — как капельки времени.
И иногда, по вечерам, из какой-нибудь мансарды —
Флейта,
И сам флейтист в окне.
И большие тюльпаны на окнах.
И может быть, Вы бы даже меня любили…

Посреди комнаты — огромная изразцовая печка,
На каждом изразце — картинка:
Роза — сердце — корабль. —
А в единственном окне —
Снег, снег, снег.

Вы бы лежали — каким я Вас люблю: ленивый,
Равнодушный, беспечный.
Изредка резкий треск
Спички.

Папироса горит и гаснет,
И долго-долго дрожит на ее краю
Серым коротким столбиком — пепел.
Вам даже лень его стряхивать —
И вся папироса летит в огонь.","I want to live with you
In a small town where the sun sets endlessly
and the bells chime endlessly.
In a little village inn,
an ancient clock counts delicately,
the droplets of time. 
And on some evenings, the sound of flute drifts down from the attic.
The flutist leans by the window,
where full tulips bloom.
In that moment, I wouldn’t mind if you didn’t love me. 

In the middle of the room, there is a stove made of large tiles.
On each tile there is a painting:
A rose, a heart, a ship. 
From our only window there is
snow, snow, snow. 

You lie just as how I love you: nonchalantly, indifferently, carelessly. 
A match scratches the silence now and then. 

The embers of your cigarette glow and then dim,
And for a long, long time the cigarette trembles at its edge, trembling. 
Short, gray, white ashes,
that you’re too lazy to flick.
And then the cigarette flies, dancing into the fire.","<p>This translation is in fact a translation of the Chinese translation of the original Russian poem. I innovate as such because through the brief and delicate Chinese language, a kind of powerful yet wistful voice emerges from Tsvetaeva’s poems that I did not discern in the English versions. Like I wrote in the essay “The New Flowers of Language,” meanings are often consummated in other languages that the poet did not even know about. Through Chinese, I saw how powerfully and distinctly Tsvetaeva loved and I fell in love with that.</p>

<p>In “I want to live with you,” the speaker’s love is filled with power and agency, as well as vulnerability and longing. She is not a devoted Petrarchan lover who withers in unrequited love, but a brave warrior who aspires to love. She loves him because she loves life, she loves love and she loves herself. “In that moment, I wouldn’t mind if you didn’t love me.“ is so wonderfully transient, nonchalant, and wistful.</p>

<p>In translating the first line, I debated between a few choices including “I’d like to live with you,” “I want to spend my life with you” and “I want to live with you.” I chose the last for a childlike yet noncommittal insistence. The first line is the essence and the premise of the whole poem. The speaker loves him and makes a life out of this love, but ultimately, her love rests on her choice and not on his choice. She wants to live in that small town with love, instead of live anywhere else with him.</p>

<p>I took inspiration from Chinese when translating the last line. There is a phrase in Chinese that translates as “flying moth dashes into the fire,” describing the dogged and death-seeking pursuit of an ideal. In my translation, I added the “dancing” imagery in “the cigarette flies, dancing into the fire,” imbuing the cigarette with life and agency. The cigarette is also a metaphor for the speaker, who knocks her fragile self against life and love, passionately and nonchalantly. Love means everything in the world, or nothing at all.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Ryan Hardy in the <em>DoubleSpeak</em> team for illuminating features of Russian that really helped in my revision of the translation.</p>
","<p>Marina Tsvetaeva (1892–1941) was born in Moscow and was one of the best twentieth-century poets in Russia and in the world. Extremely endowed, she published her first collection of poems, <em>Evening Album</em>, in 1910 when she was just eighteen, studying at the Sorbonne. Tsvetaeva lived in a most turbulent time in Russian history. In 1922, Tsvetaeva followed her husband, Sergey Efron, and emigrated to Paris, where they were socially marginalized. They returned to Russia in 1937 in the midst of the Great Terror, where tragic fates awaited them. Her husband was arrested and shot; her sister was arrested and imprisoned; her daughter was arrested, fated to spend nineteen years in labor camps. Tsvetaeva was evacuated during World War II to Yelabuga on the Kama River near Kazan, where she hanged herself in 1941. Throughout her turbulent and troubled life, Tsvetaeva’s poems remained passionate, choleric, and muscular, yet musical. Poetry and correspondence with other poets sustained her. Tsvetaeva’s poems illuminated the grief, the intense inner life and the strength of a woman battered by an unspeakable fate. It is painful to read a wistful line like:</p> 
<pre>“I want to live with you
In a small town where the sun sets endlessly
and the bells chime endlessly.”</pre>
<p>She hums a tender song to a life that almost existed, but was never possible.</p>
","<p>My name is Wenhan Zhang. I come from Singapore and China. I studied philosophy and computer science at Penn and now I am doing a Masters in computational science at Harvard. Studying and translating poetry in ENGL 120 with Professor Taije Silverman opened up the whole meaning of poetry to me. I knew then that writing, reading and translating poetry will forever be a big part of my life. Other than poetry, I love social entrepreneurship. I am interested in the intersection of technology, business and social change. Unexpectedly, I find language increasingly coming to the center of everything I hope to achieve. Language moves hearts, inspires changes, connects resources, and consummates meaning. It helps me find myself. It creates a performance out of life that makes it worth living, for myself and all others.</p>",Russian,ru,/assets/images/images_21/tsvetaeva.jpeg,photo by Limin Gao,"<div>

some-later-day,"<span lang=""ko"">먼 후일</span>",Some Later Day,Kim Sowol,Younghoon Jeong and Saagar Asnani,"먼 훗날 당신이 찾으시면
그때에 내 말이 잊었노라.

당신이 속으로 나무라면
무척 그리다가 잊었노라.

그래도 당신이 나무라면
믿기지 않아서 잊었노라.

오늘도 어제도 아니 잊고
먼 훗날 그때에 잊었노라.","If in the distant future you seek me,
Then at that time, I will say, “I forgot.”

If you do blame me silently within,
“Having truly longed for you, I forgot.”

If you would still insist on blaming me,
“Since I could not accept it, I forgot.”

I, neither today nor the day before,
But on that distant future day, forgot.","<p>
Approaching Kim Sowol’s poetry was a uniquely challenging task because of its ties to Korean folk songs, its economical use of language, and its tight metrical structure. Though it is composed of but eight short lines, Kim takes the reader on a journey of heartbreak, inner conflict, and eventual catharsis through the poem. While translating, we wanted to preserve three key elements of the original: the decasyllabic metrical structure, the alternating end repetition of the conditional tense with the word “forgot” (<span lang= ""ko"">잊었노라</span>), and the facile movement between narration and direct speech. We hoped to bring out his nuanced emotions in English without obfuscating the beautiful Korean words from which they arose.</p>
<p>While translating, one difficulty that came up was the translation of the title. <span lang= ""ko"">먼 후일</span> (derived from the Chinese character <span lang= ""zh"">後日</span>) is an idiomatic expression that differs from the commonly used Korean word for future, <span lang= ""ko"">미래</span>, in that it indicates a far-off day, a day that comes later, or one that will never come to pass. Though our initial instinct was to translate it as “future day,” that would have effaced its semantic clarity through the idiom, so we chose to use “Some later day”: one which may or may not ever occur. Kim also uses the word <span lang= ""ko"">흣날</span> in the body of the poem, which is very close to <span lang= ""ko"">후일</span>, but with a greater emphasis on time elapsed. Since a literal translation could easily become very wordy here (e.g. “on a far off day that is yet to come”), we instead chose the phrase “distant future” to stand in for the multiplicity of <span lang= ""ko"">흣날</span>.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank our good friend, Jennifer Ye Ji Cho, for her insightful feedback and nuanced comments on how to capture the poetic Korean in English.</p>","<p>Born in 1902 in Kwaksan, North Pyong’an Province (located in present-day North Korea), Kim Sowol (<span lang= ""ko"" style=""font-style: normal"">김소월</span>) is one of Korea’s most treasured poets. Through his writings during the Japanese colonial period, he revived the spirit of Korean folk traditions. He lived a short, but prolific, life in which he published poetry that encapsulates the spirit of Korean folk songs; its rhythm, pitch, and meter lead to a blurring between language and song. This makes translating Kim Sowol’s poetry particularly difficult, due to the culture-specific references and its ties to Korean folk music. His magnum opus, <em>Azalea</em> (<span lang= ""ko""><em>진달래 꽃</em></span>), poignantly captures the speech of a woman to her soon-to-be separated lover. His poetry was also famous for employing the concept of “<span lang= ""ko"">반어법</span>,” or “opposite practice,” in which he wrote the opposite of what he meant to convey. Some translators work around this by providing multiple versions of the translation, each capturing a specific mood or aspect of the original. Kim passed away in 1934 from a suspected opium overdose, although the exact cause of and motive for his death have never been determined; some speculate it was suicide, others a simple miscalculation of his daily painkillers. What we do know is that he left behind a body of poetry that we can appreciate for its frankness and clever manipulation of linguistic and musical elements. He left behind poetry that conveys heartfelt sentiments.</p>","<p>Younghoon Jeong is a masters candidate at Sogang University, located in Seoul, Korea. He studies natural language processing, and is especially interested in ethical considerations of AI. He loves to code, and often finds himself doing so at midnight while enjoying lo-fi music. Younghoon received his BA as a double major in Chinese culture and computer science. While studying abroad at Tsinghua University (Beijing, China), he realized that he loves interacting with people of varying cultural backgrounds; this has been a huge inspiration for him to take on learning foreign languages like English and Mandarin Chinese, as well as travel across the world (before COVID-19). In his free time, Younghoon likes to rap, play badminton, and drink <em>pu’er</em> tea.</p>
<p>Saagar Asnani (C’19) is a PhD student in musicology at the University of California, Berkeley. A medievalist, linguist, and poetry enthusiast, Saagar is fascinated by how music and language overlap, interact, and work together in myriad ways within our world. A scholar of medieval French musical genres, he believes that by studying the soundscapes of the past we can learn more about the structures and dynamics of human communication and perception today. He has been learning Korean for the past five years, and this is his first foray into translating Korean poetry to English. His research on medieval music has also immersed him in Latin and Middle French. As a graduating senior at Penn in 2019, he was awarded the Clifton C. Cherpack Prize in French Studies. In his free time, Saagar enjoys playing viola and is an active member of UC Berkeley’s Symphony Orchestra.</p>

maybe-its-clarity,Three Poems,Three Poems,Filippo Vignali,Giulia Rupi and John Sherer,"Forse la trasparenza o la capacità di rendere bella
la luce che lo attraversa anche quando è scarsa.
La prima caratteristica
che ti verrebbe in mente per definire il cristallo
non è la fragilità.
E allora parliamo di coraggio, sensibilità, prudenza
nell’offrirsi al mondo con pochi filtri
sapendo che il torrente scava un greto
e deposita i suoi detriti
solo quando passa lontano dalla terra degli indifferenti.
L’innocenza può essere costruita
lavorata come la purezza del cristallo
non dipende dall’essere troppo giovani
per aver assaggiato abbastanza veleno.

Riusciamo a fare silenzio
e a metterci in ascolto dei corpi?
Ci parlano di simmetrie, incastri
navi che ritrovano la costa
mute corrispondenze
respiri che si intrecciano
rossore rappreso sul viso
per il calore dato e ricevuto.
La saggezza dei corpi è un mistero
a cui dovremmo abbandonarci con fiducia
per come ci puntella un abbraccio
ci guarisce una carezza
per come sposta le nostre maree
la mezzaluna di un sorriso vero.

Vedo mio padre piangere,
sciogliersi sotto quella pioggia.
Bastioni che cadono
bombe che implodono
nella mia stanza dei giochi.
Lo vedo madido
baluginante di una forza
cresciuta dentro silenziosa
in un’attesa guerresca.
Lo vedo plastico
monumento alla prudenza
di non scomporre e rimangiare frasi
per fare uscire qualcosa
di più educato
ma di meno vero.
","Maybe it’s clarity, or the power to make the light
shining through it beautiful, even when it’s scarce.
The first quality
that would come to mind when defining a crystal
is not fragility.
And so we speak of courage, sensitivity, prudence
when giving in to the world with few filters,
knowing that the creek digs its bed
and leaves its debris
only when it flows far from the land of the indifferent.
Innocence can be built,
polished to a crystal’s purity;
it can be young or old
as long as enough venom has been tasted.

Can we keep quiet
and listen in to our bodies?
They speak of symmetries, dovetails
ships finding the coast again
silent correspondences
intertwining breaths
redness clotted on the face
for warmth given and received.
The wisdom of bodies is a mystery
we should give in to with confidence:
how a hug props us up
a caress heals us
how our tides are moved
by the half-moon of a true smile.

I see my father crying,
melting under that rain.
Bastions falling
bombs imploding
in my playroom.
I see him drenched
gleaming with a force
grown silent inside
in a warlike wait.
I see him as a plastic
monument to the prudence
of not splitting apart and taking back sentences
so as to let out something
more polite
but less true.","<p>Filippo Vignali’s poems hark back to the <em>poetica del fanciullino</em>, the “poetics of the child,” as described by the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli. In this tradition, fragility, innocence, and vulnerability are the keys that open many doors, teaching us to be our truest selves and to feel unreservedly all things good and bad. These characteristics allow us to be more aware of the world around us, to open our eyes and see reality anew; we are called to use our intuition instead of our so-called mature, rational faculties.</p>
<p>The poems in Vignali’s book <em>Le conseguenze dell’infanzia</em> (<em>Childhood Consequences</em>) engage with childhood experiences never for the sake of mere nostalgia, but in order to investigate the radical possibilities of innocence. In these poems, innocence is not a beginning state from which one emerges, but instead a quality that one achieves through trial and difficulty: “Innocence can be built, / polished to a crystal’s purity; it can be young or old / as long as enough venom has been tasted.” Youth is a source of wisdom, a wisdom rekindled in the thoughts of a retrospective adult. And that’s as it should be, for adults — too often inured to apathy — are the ones in need of such wisdom.</p>
<p>In translating these poems, we chose clarity of voice over a stimulating reading experience. Vignali uses little punctuation — less confusing in Italian than in English; Italian grammar contains many structural cues that alert readers to which verbs and nouns go together, what adjectives are describing which nouns, and so on. These cues are less abundant in English, so translating the poems with a similar lack of punctuation risks puzzling the reader, and would offer only a superficially similar reading experience.</p>
","<p>Born in 1973, Filippo Vignali lives in Rimini, Italy. He has cowritten a biography of the boxer Loris Stecca with Renzo Semprini Cesari and has written two novels: <em>Piccolo mondo</em> (2017) and <em>Il presente di ricordare</em> (2020). His collection of poems, <em>Le conseguenze dell’infanzia</em>, was published in 2018.</p>","<p>Giulia Rupi is from Rimini, Italy, and graduated with a master’s degree from the School of Foreign Languages and Cultures at the University of Bologna. She currently lives in Madrid, where she teaches Italian and English and translates into English, Italian, and Spanish.</p>
<p>John Sherer is a writer based in Brooklyn. His poems, essays, and reviews have appeared in <em>The Point</em>, <em>Hot Metal Bridge</em>, <em>Botticelli Magazine</em>, <em>Hyperallergic</em>, and <em>Gulf Coast</em>. He is the poetry editor of the <em>Festival Review</em>.</p>",Italian,it,/assets/images/images_21/vignali.jpeg,photo by a <em>DoubleSpeak</em> staffer,"<div>

millibars-of-the-storm,Millibars de l’orage,Millibars of the storm,Aimé Césaire,Sue Jia,"N’apaisons pas le jour et sortons la face 
nue face aux pays inconnus qui coupent 
aux oiseaux leur sifflet
le guet-apens s’ouvre 
le long d’un bruit de confins de planètes.
ne fais pas attention aux chenilles 
qui tissent souple mais seulement aux 
millibars qui se plantent dans le mille d’un orage
à délivrer l’espace où se hérissent 
le coeur des choses et la venue de l’homme

Rêve n’apaisons pas
parmi les clous de chevaux fous
un bruit de larmes qui tâtonne vers 
l’aile immense des paupières","Let us not soothe the day but bring out our faces 
uncovered facing countries 
undiscovered that stifle birds’ calls
the ambush begins alongside 
a noise of celestial confines.
do not pay attention to the smooth weaving caterpillars 
but only to the millibars rooted in the eye of a storm
to set free the space where 
the heart of things and the advent of humankind bristle

Dream we do not soothe
in the stampedes of the mad steeds
a sound of tears fumbling towards 
the immense wing of eyelids

* A millibar is a unit of air pressure 
in the metric system.","<p>This poem is commonly interpreted as depicting the struggle of affirming one’s identity when one faces erasure from colonial oppression. As someone who focused on building the Black consciousness, Césaire uses the violent imagery of a storm to depict the cultural violence that erases the sense of self of colonized peoples.</p>
<p>Reading the poem out loud was an important part of the process for me. The poem does not have a rhyme scheme, but there are two phrases where Césaire uses assonance, namely “la face nue face aux pays inconnus” and “les clous de chevaux fous.” Rather than following a strict translation, I focused more on preserving the sound, rhythm, and general imagery of the original French. Instead of the literal translation “the nails of mad horses,” I translated the line as “the stampedes of the mad steeds.” My translation was “our faces uncovered facing countries undiscovered,” while the literal translation was “bare face facing unknown countries.” I changed the adjective order to preserve the rhythm. I interpreted the unknown countries to mean the colonizers, since the second half of the phrase describes how they cut off birds’ calls (symbolizing, perhaps, the colonized people’s voices). I wanted to preserve how Césaire in the original French flips the traditional roles of the colonizer and the colonized by describing colonizer countries as <i>inconnus</i> (“unknown”), an adjective typically used to describe colonized, foreign countries; thus, “undiscovered” was chosen as the English translation.</p>
<p>I chose to translate “the advent of man” as “the advent of humankind” to make the writing more gender-neutral in the current context of our time. The Canadian Translation Bureau website states “in our time the male meaning of man outweighs any other,” and thus it seems appropriate to ensure the translation reflects the original meaning of the entire human species. </p>","<p>Aimé Césaire (1913–2008) is one of the most influential Francophone poets of the twentieth century and a founding figure in postcolonial Francophone literature and the cultivation of the Black consciousness. He was born and raised in Martinique (a French territory in the Caribbean) before moving to Paris for high school on a scholarship and then university. As a student in France, Césaire became deeply involved in examining Black identity in the context of French colonial oppression. Césaire founded, with other students, a journal called <em>L’Étudiant noir</em> (<em>The Black Student</em>).</p>
<p>Upon his return to Martinique after his studies, he wrote one of his most well-known works, “Cahier d’un retour au pays natal” (“Notebook of a Return to the Native Land”). His works focus on the impact of colonization on Black and Martiniquais identity. He was an essayist and playwright in addition to being a poet. His famous essay “Discourse on Colonialism” was written in a poetic prose style. Later in life, he became a prominent left-wing politician in Martinique, occupying the positions of Mayor of Fort-de-France and President of the Regional Council of Martinique.</p>
","<p>Sue was raised in Canada, studied abroad in France, and currently works in Francophone Switzerland. This has led her to accumulate a confusing mix of vocabulary in French. Sue graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2017, concentrating in statistics and minoring in French and creative writing. While at Penn, Sue was an editor on the <em>DoubleSpeak</em> team and loved exploring works by authors in different languages.</p>",French,fr,,,"<div>

if-heritage-were-called-hither-air,Wenn Die Herkunft Herluft Hiesse,If Heritage Were Called Hither-Air,Marica Bodrožić,Qingyang Zhou,"Wenn die Herkunft Herluft hiesse,
könnte ich sagen,
ich sei ein Mensch aus Wolken, könnte ich sagen,
ich sei ein Gebiet des Wetters und niemand störte
sich an meiner jugoslawischen Geburt, auch ich
selbst nicht. Mein Wetter wäre jeder Tag, wäre
ein Sonnentausch das Einfachste auf der Welt.
Mit den Lungen ginge ich auf Andromeda spazieren,
füllte die Venus aus mit einem katzengleichen Sprung.
Her Luft!, könnte ich dann sagen und lachen dabei,
weil das Ernsthafte alt in mir geworden ist, ein Zuspieler
der Wartenden, der da Hockenden, der auf die Grenzöffnungen 
Hoffenden. Menschen sind mir dabei vertraut geworden, 
immerhin. Eine ganze Zeit lang dachte ich, Menschen
seien wohl das Letzte, an das ich mich hier auf Erden
gewöhnen könnte. Dabei das Maß der Bäume, immer,
vor Augen, wie sie Fähige sind, Fähige, den Regen 
Empfangende. An einem Sonntag, es war in der Stadt
Berlin, es war ein Regentag, es war eine eigene Stunde,
da sah ich den einen Turm von dreizehn volljährigen Türmen.
Ich wuchs so aus der Erde heraus und bekam
die Gelegenheit zu einer Rede. Ich sagte mir selbst,
wäre ein jeder der Türme aus Licht, ginge die Herkunft
mich wirklich nichts mehr an. Da ich das dachte,
tönte die solare Quelle sich in meiner Küche ein,
der dreizehnte Turm gab sich zu erkennen. Ich hörte
deutlich, wie sein Name Wahrheit wurde, meine
Wahrheit, ich übte Verzicht, ich ließ los das Gewesene,
am liebsten hätte ich auch meinen Namen an die
Wache abgegeben, so übermütig und froh war ich.
Der Mann sagte aber, behalte ihn, er wird dir helfen,
dich hier und dort, mit Schuhen oder ohne, mit deinen
Füßen und der Queste der Seele fortzubewegen.","If Heritage were called Hither-Air,
I could say,
I was a person of clouds. I could say,
I was a turf of weather and no one was disturbed
By my Yugoslavian birth, not even 
Myself. Each day would be my weather.
A change of sunlight would be the simplest thing on this world.
With the lungs I’d stroll on Andromeda,
Fill up Venus with a catlike leap.
Hither, Air! I could then say while laughing,
Since the most serious part of me aged, a playmate
Of the ones waiting, of the ones crouching, of the ones hoping 
For the borders to open. People became familiar to me,
After all. For quite some time, I thought people
Were perhaps the last thing I would be accustomed to
Here on Earth. While the magnitude of the trees is always
In my mind, how capable they are, capable, 
Of receiving the rain. On a Sunday, it was in the city of 
Berlin, it was a rainy day, it was an hour of its own,
When I saw one tower among thirteen full-fledged towers.
I thus grew out of the Earth and received
The opportunity for a speech. I said to myself,
If each of the towers were made of light, the heritage
Would no longer concern me. As I thought so,
The sunbeams tinted my kitchen,
The thirteenth tower revealed itself. I heard
Clearly, how its name became truth, my
Truth. I relinquish, I let go of what had been.
Preferably I would have given my name
To the guard, so jaunty and joyful was I.
But the man said, keep it, it will help you,
Move here and there, with shoes or without, with your
Feet and the quest of the soul.","<p>Bodrožić’s poem contains plenty of neologisms, which encourage the translator to experiment with the target language and actively interpret the meaning of the poem in order to find the best translation. For instance, the word “Herluft” in the title is entirely the poet’s original creation. I chose to translate it as “Hither-Air” in order to evoke a poetic tone and to create an alliteration with the preceding word, “heritage,” (<em>Herkunft</em>). The word <em>Gebiet</em> in the fourth line can be translated as area, territory, region, zone, domain, or sphere. I initially decided to use “territory,” since the narrator appears to be quite possessive of her heritage. However, in English, “territory” triggers associations with the animal world, which is perhaps not the original intention of the poet. I eventually chose “turf,” since it can be defined as “an area or sphere of activity regarded as someone’s personal territory,” which transitions well into the discussion of the narrator’s Yugoslavian birth in the following line. Bodrožić also describes towers (<em>Türme</em>) as <em>volljährig</em>, which means “full-aged,” “mature,” or “adult,” bestowing human qualities on inanimate objects. The adjective that I chose in the translation, “full-fledged,” can be used to describe both people and objects. This word might sound less strange to English speakers, without deviating too much from the original text.</p>

<p>Though difficult decisions had to be made in the translation process, the linguistic affinities of English and German can sometimes allow for the transmission of similar tones, feelings, and sensations. One of the most striking features of the poem is the use of the subjunctive mode. My English translation preserves this feature, thus conveying the narrator’s unbounded imaginations and intense longing for the realization of fictional situations. The original German segment of “ein Zuspieler / der Wartenden, der da Hockenden, der auf die Grenzöffnungen / Hoffenden” has a rhythmic flow, since all the short phrases end with <em>en</em>. To create a similar auditory experience in English, I chose to terminate each clause of the translation with <em>ing</em>, even though in German grammar <em>Wartenden</em>, <em>Hockendedn</em>, and <em>Hoffenden</em> all function as adjectives, rather than as verbs.</p>
","<p>Marica Bodrožić is a German writer of Croatian descent. She was born in 1973 in Svib in former Yugoslavia and immigrated to Hessen, Germany, at age ten. Bodrožić began publishing novels and essays in German in 2002, while also working as a translator of English literature into Croatian. As a former guest professor at Dartmouth College, she taught German poetry from the twentieth century to the present. One of her best-known literary works is the novel <em>Kirschholz und alte Gefühle</em> (<em>A Cherrywood Table</em>), which received the EU Prize for Literature in 2013. Her writing often reminisces her childhood in a socialist country and discusses the possibility of personal empowerment through language. Regarding German as her “second mother tongue,” Bodrožić frequently strives to transcend linguistic limitations through neologism in her poems and novels. In 2007, she co-directed a documentary with Katja Gasser, titled <em>Herzgemälde der Erinnerung – Eine Reise durch mein Kroatien</em> (<em>Heart Painting of Memory: A Journey through My Croatia</em>). Dedicated to eliminating linguistic barriers between member states of the former Yugoslavia, Bodrožić signed the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks, and Montenegrins in 2017. She currently lives in Berlin.</p>","<p>Qingyang Zhou (Freya) is a PhD candidate in German at UC Berkeley. She graduated from Penn in 2020 with a BA in German, comparative literature, and cinema and media studies. Originally from Shenzhen, China, Freya is interested in the intersections of German-Asian cultures, particularly as they pertain to the collaborations between East/West Germany, China/Taiwan, and North/South Korea during the Cold War and beyond. She has published academic articles on queer cinema, German and Israeli literature, interactions between Jewish refugees and the Chinese in Shanghai during World War II, and East German portrayals of China in literary and filmic travelogues.</p>",German,de,,,"<div>

las plumas

la tinta
porque ellos no quieren
que yo escriba
y me han hundido
en esta celda de castigo
pero ni así ahogarán mi rebeldía.
Me lo han quitado todo
— bueno, casi todo —
porque me queda la sonrisa
el orgullo de sentirme un hombre libre
y en el alma un jardín
de eterna florecitas.
Me lo han quitado todo
las plumas
los lápices
pero me queda la tinta de la vida
— mi propia sangre —
y con ella escribo versos todavía.

*Original escrito con mi sangre y una astillita 
de madera en abril de 1981 en las celdas
de castigo de la Cárcel Combinado del Este, 
en La Habana.","They’ve taken everything from me,
the pens, 
the pencils, 
the ink,
because they don’t want
me to write,
and they’ve sunk me down 
deep in this cell,
but my rebellion will not drown.
They’ve taken everything from me —
well, almost everything —
but here is my smile,
the pride of a man set free,
and in my soul a garden,
flowering eternally.
They’ve taken everything from me,
the pens, 
the pencils,
but here is the ink of life —
my own blood —
and thus I write my verses still.

*Original written with my blood and a splinter of wood in April 1981 
in the cells of the East Combined Prison in Havana.","<p>The most striking part of this poem to me is the ending, when we find out that the central metaphor is no metaphor at all. Our author takes the well-used living-through-writing idea and writes with his actual blood, the only means available to him at the time. The second thing that drew me to this poem many years ago when I read it in a Spanish class was the beat — of blood? — that moves it along. I attempted to match this musicality by adding some rhymes which are not present in the original. I also utilized a double meaning in English not present in Spanish: “still” as both “even now” and “not moving,” while the original carries only the first connotation. This change, I believe, reflects both the message of the poem that imprisonment will not defeat the poet and that the act of writing solidifies his resolve and preserves it for the future.</p>","<p>What little information exists about Armando Valladares on the internet is full of contradictions and differing accounts. The facts? He was born in Cuba in 1937. He was imprisoned in 1960. He smuggled his poetry that would become the 1974 collection <em>From My Wheelchair</em> out of jail. He was released from prison in 1982 and published a book, <em>Against All Hope</em>, which detailed torture at the hands of his guards. He served as the US ambassador to the UN Commission on Human Rights from 1988 to 1990. The less-straightforward? I won’t comment on the details because they are too numerous and I am not a qualified historian, but suffice it to say that some claims made by the Cuban government, the U.S. government, and Valladares himself could not be substantiated. All sides have tales they wish to tell, whether in good faith or bad, so it’s hard to know what exactly to believe. However, I believe Valladares when he said, “Poetry is a weapon.”</p>","<p>Margaret Lawlace is a graduate student in clinical psychology at the University of Cincinnati.

","<p>We chose <em>The Story of Khun Chang Khun Phaen</em> because it tells the story of commoners in the epic poem style, which was traditionally reserved only for Kings or the Buddha, despite being written by the King himself. Other works written in the same period only portray the life of the elite classes and royalty, real or imagined. However, this work tells the story of commoners in the small province of Suphanburi and references the religions, culture, and beliefs of the non-elite there. Despite being mostly about “normal people,” the popularity of <em>The Story of Khun Chang Khun Phaen</em> has endured, having been retold in movie and TV formats.</p>
<p>The excerpt opens with Khun Phaen, a novice monk, sneaking into Nang Phim’s room to make love to her. This is quite striking because it contravenes Buddhist monks’ vow of celibacy. The explicit language used to describe the scene is shocking because it runs counter to Thai cultural norms. This act is also a breach of public trust because Khun Phaen is a monk, representing both religion and the King, as the monarchy is the patron of Thai Buddhism; and so, lays bare the unspeakable aspects of Thai society. Those same taboos are relevant today, as people are obligated to be silent (or silenced) about issues like prostitution, despite being common practice.</p>
<p>We endeavored to preserve the symbolism of the traditional literary Thai idioms for sex, i.e. thunderstorms, heavy rain, or wild rivers. Further, the status of Khun Paen as a novice monk might be a metaphor for his love for Nang Phim since he is risking everything for her. Another view might be that Nang Phim’s acceptance of Khun Phaen shows a greater love for him, as she likely has far more to lose should they be discovered. Given the status gap between the pair, the question of their comparative agency adds a compelling intellectual twist to the tale.</p>
<p>We also preserved as many cultural references as possible — the “sacred grain” being an important example of such. The “sacred grain” is rice that has been blessed (or hexed) by monks or other important religious figures. Sacred rice is believed to bring good luck, chase away ghosts, or make people lose consciousness — the implication being that the servants in the house would be lulled into a slumber, unaware of Khun Phaen’s entry into Nang Phim’s room — protecting both their reputations in the process.</p>
","<p>King Phra Buddha Leotla Naphalai, or King Rama II, was the second king of the Chakri Dynasty. During his reign (1809–1824) Thailand was at peace with its neighboring countries; therefore, King Rama II could promote Thai culture and arts including poetry, wood carving, sculptures, and music. King Rama II was best known for his artistic talent, and his reign was Thailand’s cultural renaissance. He loved poetry so much that he employed poets to work in the royal palace; those poets were called “royal poets.” The most famous one was Sunthon Phu, Thailand’s Shakespeare, who was honored by UNESCO as a world poet. <em>The Story of Khun Chang Khun Phaen</em> in this episode was written by King Rama II and a team of royal poets.</p>","<p>Peeriya and John are award-winning authors and translators who excel in creating English language rhyme schemes which echo that of their sources, while accurately communicating the author’s message.</p>
<p>In 2019, their passion for literature and language led to cofounding InterThaiMedia LLC to create media that brings people together across languages and cultures.

lilies,Krinovi,Lilies,Mak Dizdar,Emma Arsekin,"U polju i u gori bijeli krinovi procvali

Po polju i gori krin kao da nešto zbori
Po gori i dolu svaki krin

I kada tiho između procvalih cvjetova
Zamišljen tako
Prolaziš

Pitajući se isto tako kao i ti

","In the field and in the forest, white lilies bloom

Across the field and forest, it is as if the lily is saying something
Across the mountain and valley each lily
Is as if it is burning

And when quietly between blossoming flowers
So deep in thought
You pass

Maybe like me you think of those who
Here before you quietly
Passed

Between blossoming white flowers

Wondering just like you
What are these white
Lilies

Are they someone’s clicks
Or
Shrieks

Signs of those who once passed
And in these wastelands
Hopelessly
Treaded

In search of white flowers

(1966)
","<p>The biggest hurdle in translating “Krinovi” was maintaining Dizdar’s pensive tone and relationship to time, which play starring roles in such a short, unadorned piece. “Krinovi” is from the larger work <em>Kameni Spavač</em> (<em>Stone Sleeper</em>) (1966), inspired by Bosnia’s <em>stećci</em> — monumental medieval tombstones. <em>Kameni Spavač</em> explores Bosnia’s rich, unique history from the perspective of Eastern Europe’s post-World War II identity-forming period, and “Krinovi” in particular makes this history come alive. Dizdar does not veil his symbolism: <em>stećci</em> are traditionally carved from white stone and dot the landscape like flowers, and the Bosnian lily (<em>Lilium bosniacum</em>, featured on the medieval Bosnian coat of arms) is one of Bosnia’s most recognizable national symbols.</p>
<p>With this context in mind, “Krinovi” — or “Lilies” — becomes the story of a nation caught between past and present. Capturing this sense of haunting timelessness in an English translation proved to be challenging, and I made some stylistic choices to try to preserve this atmosphere at the expense of fidelity to literal meanings. In particular, many of the verbs used in the original text are in present- or past-continuous tense, but were translated in simple tenses to preserve Dizdar’s minimalist style and uninterrupted flow. For example, it would be more accurate to translate <em>prolazili</em> as “(they) were passing” than as “(they) passed,” but I worried that using this translation would sound clunky and obscure the central role of the past in the poem. Other verbs are more nuanced. For example, in the first line, I translated <em>procvali</em> as “bloom”; in context, however, this word feels like a strange blend of past and present tense, and might best translate to something like “are bloomed.” In a poem that deals so heavily with living history, this verb choice works wonders in Bosnian, but it is difficult to recreate the effect in translation.</p>","<p>Mehmedalija “Mak” Dizdar (1917–1971) was born in southern Bosnia to a Muslim Bosniak family. At nineteen, he relocated to Sarajevo, where he graduated from gymnasium and spent his years during World War II. His mother and sister were killed in the Jasenovac concentration camp. Dizdar became a devout supporter of the Communist Yugoslav Partisans and served as the editor-in-chief of <em>Oslobođenje</em>, a renowned Bosnian daily newspaper founded as an anti-Nazi publication. He later became the President of the Writers’ Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he served until his death.</p>
<p>Despite his political alignment, Dizdar’s poetry drew primarily from pre-Ottoman Bosnian Christianity, Islamic mysticism, and the cultural remains of medieval Bosnia. He was heavily inspired by inscriptions on medieval Bosnian tombstones (<em>stećci</em>), which are prominent religious and cultural symbols in his poetry. Dizdar used a medieval vantage point in his most influential work, allowing him to contemplate themes such as death, the experience of the world, homeland, the afterlife, and placement within history. His works, <em>Kameni Spavač</em> (<em>Stone Sleeper</em>) and <em>Modra Rijeka</em> (<em>Blue River</em>), are considered among the most important Bosnian poetic achievements of the twentieth century.</p>","<p>Emma Arsekin is an undergraduate studying history and political science at the University of Pennsylvania, with minors in East Central European studies and international relations. She is the daughter of Bosnian refugees who fled the Yugoslav Wars in the mid-1990s.

Quoi? — L’Éternité.

Avec le soleil.

Murmurons l’aveu
De la nuit si nulle
Et du jour en feu.

Des humains suffrages
Des communs élans
Là tu dégages
Et voles selon.

Puisque de vous seules,
Braises de satin,
Le Devoir s’exhale
Sans qu’on dise: enfin.

Là pas d’espérance
Nul orietur
Science avec patience,
La supplice est sûr.

Elle est retrouvée.
Quoi? — L’Éternité.
C’est la mer allée
Avec le soleil.
","It is found anew.
What? — Eternity.
’Tis the sea that pursues
The sun’s infinity.

Oh, vigilant soul,
Softly we confess
Of night’s empty hole
And kindling day’s caress.

From human praise
From common desires
You part ways
And still fly higher.

Since from only you,
Embers of satin,
Duty exhales through
With no end imagined.

There is no hope there, 
Nor any rising
Reason and patience pare, 
Torment is on the horizon.

It is found again.
What? — Eternity.
’Tis the sea that pursues
The sun’s infinity. 
","<p>Arthur Rimbaud’s “Eternity,” published in May 1872, reflects a marked shift in the poet’s form and style, opting for a more subtle tone and delicate imagery to express his desire for spiritual rejuvenation. This follows a period of violent passion, jealousy, and guilt on account of his illicit relationship with fellow poet Paul Verlaine. More importantly, the poem represents a liminal stage in Rimbaud’s poetic career: the departure from poetic convention in the form of verse composition into the individual territory, where he pushed the boundaries of poetic structure and style through his later works. “Eternity” is a timeless depiction of an evanescent moment, the sunset at sea.</p>
<p>The interplay of light and dark and the layered visual and aural imagery that Rimbaud uses to emphasize the abstract nature of the setting portrays eternity as an elusive yet tantalizing experience for the narrator. In keeping with this interpretation while consolidating the original form to the greatest extent possible, I chose to translate <em>allée</em>, which is literally translated as “gone” to “pursues.” By doing so, I aimed to characterize this scene between the sea and the sun as an eternal journey as opposed to an eternal destination for the narrator, thereby setting the stage for the flurry of observations and emotions that ensues. The sun also represents an object of rapture for the narrator, so I translated it in a manner that complements the transience of the moment: “the sun’s infinity” within an “Eternity.”</p>
<p>In the second stanza, I translated <em>âme sentinelle</em> as “oh, vigilant soul,” as opposed to other translations describing a “guardian soul” or “sentinel soul,” as it seems to convey the soul as a better version of the narrator, one that sees more and understands more. This is better suited to Rimbaud’s character, which the narrator presumably reflects, in that the narrator emulates the soul, as Rimbaud intends to become a more idealized version of himself. This further supports my translation of the next line where <em>Murmurons l’aveu</em> becomes “Softly we confess,” a reluctant declaration between the narrator and the soul. The translation imbues the concept of eternity with an air of secrecy and provides further rationale for its elusive nature. The simple change between the next two lines, “night’s empty hole” and “kindling day’s caress,” further demarcates his past from that which he aims to be. By leaving his old self behind, Rimbaud shall “part ways” and “still fly higher,” thereby liberating himself from “human praise” (translated from <em>humains suffrages</em> — a poet’s success is derived from recognition of the quality of their work by others) and “common desires” (translated from <em>communs élans</em> — a pointed allusion to his relationship with Paul Verlaine).</p>
<p>It is now in the fifth and sixth stanzas that Rimbaud speaks of the ill-fated future. I chose to interpret the final two lines, “Le Devoir s’exhale / Sans qu’on dise: enfin,” as Rimbaud foreseeing a futile struggle to live his current life and complete his duties as a poet with satisfaction, thus “Duty’s exhale blown / And no end imagined.” This is only made clearer in the sixth stanza, in which I translated <em>Là pas d’espérance</em> as “There is no hope there,” “there” being his future life as a poet, and <em>Nul orietur</em> as “Nor any rising.” The translation of the third line in the fifth stanza proved to be quite difficult as <em>orietur</em>, an old French noun derived from the Latin verb <em>orior</em>, loosely translated as “to emerge” or “to rise,” had little pertinence to the poem. Of its several meanings, I chose to define <em>orietur</em> as “rising” to express a double entendre with the physical rising of the sun and the spiritual rising of Rimbaud above his former, banal life. With the repetition of the first stanza in the last, Rimbaud emphasizes the derivative nature of eternity and, more importantly, the repetitive and seemingly unresolved struggle he had faced to achieve spiritual reform.</p>","<p>Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud (1854–1891) was a French poet renowned for his avant-garde works and later influence on modern literature and arts, which served as a precursor to the Surrealist movement that manifested in full force almost three decades after his death. Rimbaud is most notably remembered as a pioneer of the Symbolist movement in late nineteenth-century France that sought to push beyond the boundaries of realism and naturalism and infuse poetry with more imagination in the form of visions and dreams. Though this is perhaps best exemplified in his most famous poetry book <em>Une Saison en Enfer</em> (<em>A Season in Hell</em>, 1873), the emergence of this style is first witnessed in Rimbaud’s smaller poetry collection <em>Derniers Vers</em> (1872). Rimbaud’s artful use of synaesthetic imagery and the subtle manipulation of color and tone with a few well-chosen words adds a layered conception to reality, an essence underlying the material world that is best seen and understood through powerful emotional responses. Rimbaud’s later shift to prose poetry coincided with his preference for a modernist art form; he kept this stance until he abandoned poetry altogether in 1875.</p>","<p>Keshav Sharma is a freshman at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, studying in the faculty of health sciences. He enjoys the works of Romantic novelist Victor Hugo, postmodern novelist Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, and seventeenth-century playwright Molière. His interest in translating poetry stems from his belief that all languages have universal similarities and it is simply up to us to uncover them.</p>",French,fr,,,"<div>

El niño la está mirando.  

En el aire conmovido  
mueve la luna sus brazos  
y enseña, lúbrica y pura,

bronce y sueño, los gitanos.

a dress of blossoms, white, she wears,
the child at her, he stares, he looks, 
he looks still, and still he stares.

Her arms extend and slide and move, 
arouse and stir the shaken air.
Lubricious, she is showing now,
resolved and stout, her hard tin breasts.

Take flight, oh moon, oh moon, oh moon!
If gypsies were to find you there
they would, no doubt, craft from your heart 
white rings and beads to fit their wares!

Be quiet, child, and let me dance, 
as when the gypsies come upstairs 
the anvil shall then be the bed
where you will lie, eyes closed, and bare!

Take flight, oh moon, oh moon, oh moon!
I hear the rumble of their mares!
Away, dim child! Look out, don’t step! 
My starchy whiteness you may taint!

The rider strode, and swift he approached, 
the drumbeat sowed across the plains.
Inside the forge, the anvil is
bed for the child, eyes closed, and bare.

And through the field of olive trees 
within a dream, bronze gypsies came.
Their heads well raised, they stand staunch, 
their eyes half-closed and unaware.

Oh, hear the way the nightjar sings! 
Oh, hear its song, its grieved fanfare! 
Up in the sky, the moon ascends 
next to a child, his hand with hers.

Inside the forge, the gypsies moan, 
their voices cast cries of despair.
A vigil keeps, the air with gloom, 
a gloomy vigil keeps the air.
","<p>I read several English translations of this famous poem and always encountered the same problem: the words of the poet are treated as a sacred material, and the translator’s objective is to find the closest intelligible approximation. Yet here Lorca combines both literary exquisiteness with a sort of childish nonsense (as is the arbitrary repetition of some words), which conveys what I believe to be the poem’s universality. Moreover, the octosyllabic verse is the traditional form of the popular song in Spanish, and breaking it results in a text intended to be read and not to be listened to. Perhaps out of stubbornness, I decided to keep the octosyllable. However, as I felt this structure sounded too foreign in English, I rearranged it into iambic tetrameter. Now, those familiar with Spanish may know it is quite verbose as a language, so filling up some of those verses was a challenge. Sometimes I even had the opposite problem as seen in the example of the word <em>olivar</em> (“field of olive trees”). After accepting the limitations of the translation process, my solution was either to heretically add my own words or to mutilate the text, so I could preserve the musicality (<em>perdón, Federico</em>).</p>","<p>Federico García Lorca (1898–1936) is perhaps the most renowned Spanish poet and playwright of the twentieth century and one of the main figures of the avant-garde in Spain. This poem, from his 1928 book <em>Romancero Gitano</em> (lit. <em>Gypsy Songbook</em>), combines the influence of classical poets from sixteenth-century Spain with the surrealist movement of its epoch. It also references the popular song from the subaltern classes of southern Spain and features a strong influence from its Arabic roots. As such, many of his poems (this one included) have been adapted as flamenco songs during the years.</p>
<p>A supporter of socialism, García Lorca was arrested and assassinated by fascists at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.</p>
","<p>Darío Goldgel Carballo is a PhD candidate in the romance languages department at the University of Pennsylvania, where he analyzes movies no one will watch and books no one will read in order to reflect on the social realities of Latin America. Darío really hates writing his own biography, as he feels it sounds like boasting, and will hope that <em>DoubleSpeak</em> is informal enough to forgive him. He has, indeed, done some stuff in his life, but nothing that can trick the readers into taking his translation more seriously.</p>",Spanish,es,,,"<div>

Verzerrt, unwahr, nicht mehr in menschlicher Form.

Und ich stehe,
Lauf zu ihm rüber
Und umarme ihn mit gemeinsamen Tränen.</p>

S’asseoir dans les régions désoles au dehors de la ville
Le soleil brillant éclat ; il apparait que j’ai les larmes aux yeux
Il me faut plisser les yeux pour voir 
Et c’est là où je vois l’image floue 
D’une veuve 
Son ombre qui étincelle à l’horizon 
Déformé, innocent, qui ne pouvait pas appartenir à un être-humain
Quand il est avancé 
J’ai pu me lever
Fuir là-bas
Lui embrasser et pleurer

para distinguir, 
una reliquia, apenas,
una sombra parpadeó hacia el horizonte.
Distorcionado, irreal, perdiendo la forma humana,
se acercó a mí.
Me puse de pie,
corrí hacia él
y lo abracé con lágrimas compartidas.

<h2>translated by Ryan Hardy</h2>

Опасность жизни повторяется себя:
Память может быть размагнита.
Не помню, что случилось вчера -- 
как будто она никогда не существовала.
Сегодня семьдесят седьмой день карантина,

Я сел дома
как будто сел в пустом поле за города,
солнечный свет излучал, проливая на мои слезы.
Мне нужно было глаза, чтобы поглядеть,
чтобы различать
пережитка, едва,
тень мерцал на горизонте.
Искаженая, нереальная, не могущий поддерживать
человеческую форму,
он подошёл ко мне ближе.
Я бы вставал,
подбежал к нему
под руку, чтобы плакать вместе.
07.04.2020","<p>Zhang Zhihao’s depiction of the mundane, repetitive quarantine life has resonated with all of us. The poem <span lang= ""zh"">《开封日记》</span> speaks of a collectively shared experience in the times of isolation and imparts hope in the age of turmoil. When translating the poem, we have noted the matter-of-factness and repetitions in Zhang’s original poem and have tried to preserve these qualities when translating the poem into different languages. For instance, our Italian translation uses repeated <em>erò</em> ending of the future tense verbs as well as the echoed <em>i</em> in <em>piedi</em>, <em>lui</em> in the last few lines to evoke the sense of time blending together when the surroundings don’t change much. Similarly, our Portuguese translation describes the slow passing of time in quarantine by adding extra syllables such as <em>eu</em> and unnecessary prepositions to slow down the pace of the translation.</p>

<p>Many of our translation teams have noted the simplicity of the poem that is easy to replicate in other languages, though there have been a few difficult words that require imagery to hone in on the word choice. “<span lang= ""zh"">空地</span>” in line 8, for example, whose literal translation is “empty/open ground/field,” is translated as “open field” in English and <em>prado</em> in Spanish, both evoking the imagery of a park with meadows, a beautiful image in the dark time of the pandemic. In line 12, “<span lang= ""zh"">未亡人</span>” is translated as “a survived man” in English and <em>un sopravvissuto</em> in Italian, while referring to those who have fought hard in the pandemic and made it through. The past participles of “survive” and <em>sopravvivere</em> used here set a tone of finality to an action that seems long and enduring.</p>

<p>Not all of our staff team speak Chinese, and we have based our translations in other languages on the English version produced by our Mandarin-speaking staff members. Nevertheless, we all agree that the global nature of the pandemic allows the piece to resonate across many languages. This year, we also include a translation into Old English, a seemingly dead language yet one that still fits well in the contemporary context. <em>Beowulf</em> and many other Old English poems often focus on loss and grief and our powerlessness in the face of death, no matter our strength or heroic ability. What we have collectively lived through in the past year and a half indeed revolves around such themes. However, in such times of grief and darkness, we still see lights of hope and hold on to them. Whether it is the imagination of sitting on open fields outside of the city, or running over to embrace the survived man, we find strength through this collectively shared experience. As in the last line of our German translation, “Und umarme ihn mit gemeinsamen Tränen,” the addition of <em>gemeinsamen</em> (“common” in English) captures such collective experience with a Romantic sense of humanity. We continue to support each other with caring and hope while fighting through the path of danger and turmoil.</p>
