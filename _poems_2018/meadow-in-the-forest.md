poem: "Die grüne Fahne gehißt hat der Abend: mein Herz hat\r\n                                                         geträumt…\r\n\r\nIm
  Schatten der riesigen Pilze grast wieder das goldene Reh:\r\nHier wand ich den Toten
  die Kränze des Sommers. \r\nIch sprach auch: verbrannt ist das Laub vom Holunder.\r\nSo
  schläfst du nun tiefer: du weißt, daß ich weinte.\r\n\r\nDen Stern vergrub ich sehr
  tief, einen Speerwurf von hier:\r\nDas Mal deiner Wange, mein Abschied vom Himmel."
transpoem: "The green colors were lifted by the night. So my heart had\r\n                                                            dreamt…\r\n\r\nIn
  the shadow of elephant mushrooms the copper doe is grazing again.\r\nHere my hands
  loop a crown of summer for the dead.\r\nI speak too: crackling brown is the sprig
  of elderflower.\r\nSo you sleep more deeply now. You know that I cried.\r\n\r\nFor
  the star I dug a grave deep down, a spear throw from here —\r\nthe mark of your
  cheek, my parting from heaven."
note: "<p>Moving to Germany this past year has brought on a number of changes in my
  life, from the way that I drink my coffee, to keeping a travel bag packed for a
  new city every other weekend. These changes, of course, don’t begin to touch what
  it’s like to live in a new language, to feel at times that you’ve once again become
  a child lost for words. I spend many of my afternoons in Nuremberg walking through
  the city’s parks. Trees have always helped me to feel at home, no matter where I’ve
  moved. There’s something reassuring about seeing tree branches in a new place and
  thinking, <em>Yes, they’re peaceful here, too</em>. I was disappointed to realize,
  though, that when I tried to describe the quiet of these parks in German, the language
  in which they’d grown, I fell short. So when I came across a collection of Paul
  Celan’s early works in the city library and saw how many poems he’d written about
  parks and meadows, I felt a rush of gratitude for his words. I find translation
  to be an act of coming closer to a poem. You engage with every word before carrying
  the whole into a new language. Translating Celan has brought me closer to his individual
  poems and the German language, but even more importantly, it’s reminded me that
  our thoughts and emotional relationships to this world are shared. The impressions
  that I had in English existed in German as well, already years before. And this
  is why I love translation. It challenges us to look beyond something artificial,
  such as language, and find kinship with other humans.</p>\r\n<p>Translating from
  German to English always brings trouble when it comes to German definite articles
  and their cases, which simply don’t exist in English. Without definite articles
  to indicate accusative and nominative case, there’s less freedom to change the order
  of subject and object in an English sentence. For this reason, I’ve reordered words
  in certain lines but otherwise stayed quite close to the original.</p>"
abio: "<p>Paul Celan was born in 1920 in Chernivsti, the capital of Bukovina, formerly
  northern Romania. Because Romania’s medical faculty was closed to him as a Jewish
  man, Celan began his first years of university study in France in 1938–1939. The
  Soviet Union occupied Bukovina in 1940, with Chernivtsi later coming under German
  occupation in 1941. Celan’s parents were sent to forced labor camps in June 1942;
  his father died some months later from typhus, and his mother was killed by an SS
  guard. Celan was sent to a forced labor battalion in northeast Romania from the
  summer of 1942 until early 1944. In 1945, Celan relocated to Bucharest, where he
  translated Russian into Romanian and published his first poems. Before moving to
  Paris in 1948, Celan lived in Vienna, his only residence with German as its exclusive
  vernacular language. His departure from Vienna was an attempt to leave behind his
  youth and its unbearable memories of war and his parents’ deaths. This geographic
  and emotional move is also manifested as a break between Celan’s early and later
  poetic works. Paul Celan died in Paris in April, 1970.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Michaela Kotziers received her BA in English literature with concentrations
  in creative writing and medieval studies from the University of Pennsylvania in
  2017. She is currently teaching English in Nuremberg, Germany.</p>"
