poem: "<h1>VI</h1>\r\n\r\nCes liens d’or, ceste bouche vermeille,\r\nPleine de lis,
  de roses, et d’œuilletz,\r\nEt ces couraulx chastement vermeilletz,\r\nEt ceste
  joue à l’Aurore pareille:\r\nCes mains, ce col, ce front, et ceste oreille,\r\nEt
  de ce sein les boutons verdeletz,\r\nEt de ces yeulx les astres jumeletz,\r\nQui
  font trembler les ames de merveille :\r\nFeirent nicher Amour dedans mon sein,\r\nQui
  gros de germe avoit le ventre plein,\r\nD’œufz non formez et de glaires nouvelles.\r\nEt
  luy couvant (qui de mon cuœur jouit\r\nNeuf mois entiers) en un jour m’eclouit\r\nMille
  amoureaux chargez de traits et d’aisles.\r\n\r\n<h1>VII</h1>\r\n\r\nBien qu’à grand
  tort il te plaist d’allumer\r\nDedans mon cuœur, siege à ta seigneurie,\r\nNon d’une
  amour, ainçois d’une furie\r\nLe feu cruel pour mes os consumer,\r\nL’aspre torment
  ne m’est point si amer,\r\nQu’il ne me plaise, et si n’ay pas envie\r\nDe me douloir
  : car je n’ayme ma vie\r\nSi non d’autant qu’il te plaist de l’aimer.\r\nMais si
  les cieulx m’ont fait naistre, Ma dame,\r\nPour estre tien, ne genne plus mon ame,\r\nMais
  pren en gré ma ferme loyaulté.\r\nVault il pas mieulx en tirer du service,\r\nQue
  par l’horreur d’un cruel sacrifice,\r\nL’occire aux piedz de ta fiere beauté ?\r\n\r\n<h1>VIII</h1>\r\n\r\nLors
  que mon œil pour t’œillader s’amuse,\r\nLe tien habile à ses traits decocher,\r\nEstrangement
  m’empierre en un rocher,\r\nComme au regard d’une horrible Meduse.\r\nMoy donc rocher,
  si dextrement je n’use\r\nL’outil des Seurs pour ta gloire esbaucher,\r\nQu’un seul
  Tuscan est digne de toucher.\r\nNon le changé, mais le changeur accuse\r\nLas qu’ay
  je dit ? Dans un roc emmuré,\r\nEn te blamant je ne suis asseuré,\r\nTant j’ay grand
  peur des flammes de ton ire,\r\nEt que mon chef par le feu de tes yeux\r\nSoit diffamé,
  comme les monts d’Epire\r\nSont diffamez par les flammes des cieulx.\r\n"
transpoem: "<h1>VI</h1>\r\n\r\nThese vermillion lips, these golden rings,\r\nFull
  of lilies, roses, and carnations,\r\nAnd corals of scarlet colorations,\r\nAnd this
  cheek, Aurore’s own, to my mind brings:\r\nThese hands, this neck, this chest, this
  ear, these things,\r\nFrom this bosom, a green button blazons,\r\nAnd from these
  eyes, the heavens’ conjunctions,\r\nThat make tremble even the souls of kings:\r\nEnsconced
  is the Love within my bosom,\r\nThou filled with seed, has a stomach buxom,\r\nWith
  eggs yet unformed and glairs newly made.\r\nAs it develops (my heart rejoices\r\nNine
  whole months) and in one day produces\r\nA thousand lovers with wings and bolts
  staid.\r\n\r\n<h1>VII</h1>\r\n\r\nAlthough with great pain thou wish to ignite\r\nWithin
  my heart, the seat of thy power,\r\nNot of love, more so that of a furor\r\nThe
  cruel fire, to my bones consume, so bright,\r\nSheer torment is not so bitter to
  bite,\r\nThat it displeases me and if it were\r\nTo sadden me: I love life, my flower,\r\nOnly
  as much as it serves thy delight.\r\nBut if the skies birthed me, I cajole,\r\nTo
  be yours, do not bother my poor soul,\r\nTake confidence in my firm loyalty.\r\nIs
  it not better to find in service,\r\nThan by the horror of cruel sacrifice,\r\nSweet
  death at the feet of thy proud beauty?\r\n\r\n<h1>VIII</h1>\r\n\r\nMy eye wanders
  and alights upon thee,\r\nGiven to such sudden movements, thine own,\r\nStrangely
  imprisons me, as if in stone,\r\nAs Medusa’s horrid gaze upon me.\r\nThus become
  rock, I cannot play nimbly\r\nThe Muses’ lyre, to thy glory intone,\r\nPlayed by
  Tuscans, worthy was he alone.\r\nNot the changèd, the changer, proclaims she,\r\nAlas,
  what have I said? Walled within rock,\r\nI blame thee, but am not assured by talk,\r\nSuch
  is my great fear of flames of thine ire,\r\nAnd that my name, by the fire in thine
  eyes\r\nBe defamed. Epirus’s peaks, ever higher\r\nWere defamèd by the flames in
  the skies."
note: "<p>In French, there are two separate words for describing the rewriting of
  literature from one language to another. There is <em>traduction</em>, which is
  simply translating the meaning of a string of words from one language to another.
  One has the freedom to change the syntax, grammar, word choice, and even rhyme scheme
  in a <em>traduction</em>. The other word to describe such a process is <em>translation</em>,
  which means rewriting the work in another language while maintaining the original
  artistry, such as the rhyme scheme, the word choice, the rhythm, and flow. In essence,
  in a <em>translation</em>, one is writing poetry of one’s own, using the original
  as a baseline. In this case, I have chosen to do a <em>translation</em> of three
  sonnets from Pierre de Ronsard’s collection <em>Les Amours</em>. Written in <em>Moyen
  Français</em>, or Middle French, in the mid-sixteenth century, <em>Les Amours</em>
  is a collection of sonnets describing Ronsard’s love for a young woman named Cassandre.
  What Beatrice is to Dante, what Laure is to Petrarch, Cassandre is to Ronsard. He
  poured all his creative gifts into describing her virtues and beauty in these sonnets,
  a style of poem heavily influenced by Petrarch and Shakespeare before him. I chose
  these three sonnets to give a glimpse into Ronsard’s mastery of the genre. His succinct
  yet vague declarations of love tug at the heartstrings and depict love through a
  variety of lenses: physical, spiritual, and philosophical.</p>\r\n<p>I attempted
  to keep with Ronsard’s original poetry by keeping the decasyllabic form throughout
  the three sonnets. Every line is ten syllables long and follows the same rhyme scheme
  as the original. The first two quatrains are ABBAABBA, the next couplet is always
  CC, and the final quatrain alternates between DEED and DEDE. Finally, I attempted
  to keep with the time period and used the informal, ancient form “thou” for any
  parallel usage in the original French. What strikes me the most about Ronsard’s
  creativity, is that it holds true for tales and clichés of <em>amour</em> even today,
  nearly five hundred years later.</p>"
abio: "<p>Pierre de Ronsard was born in 1524 in a small village known as Couture-Sur-Loir,
  on the banks of the Loir River. Ronsard finished his education in Paris and quickly
  made a name for himself as a great poet. Growing up in Renaissance France, he started
  his career under Madeleine de France as a translator of classical works into vernacular
  languages. After her death, he found himself in Paris and slowly made acquaintances
  with several other up-and-coming poets and authors of the time, including Antoine
  de Baïf, Pontus de Tyard, Joachim du Bellay, and Étienne Jodelle, among others.
  This group came to be called <em>La Pléiade</em>, modeled after the Alexandrian
  Pleiad of ancient times. Ronsard was the founding member of the group, and has since
  been known as one of the greatest lyricists of French history. Today, <em>La Pléiade</em>
  forms an essential part of the French literary canon and is studied by French literature
  students of all levels.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Saagar Asnani is a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences at Penn studying
  biology, French, and music. He has always considered himself an avid Francophile
  at heart, and more recently a medievalist, concentrating much of his French studies
  on the Middle Ages and Renaissance, mostly in the realm of literature. Having spent
  a semester in Lyon studying the works of poets like Ronsard and Chrétien de Troyes,
  he wishes to make these masterpieces accessible to a wider audience and to translate
  more works from Middle and Old French into English. He plays viola in various groups
  across campus, including the Penn Symphony, and intends to go to medical school
  after finishing his undergraduate education.</p>\r\n"
