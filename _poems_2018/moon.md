poem: "גם למראה נושן \r\nיש רגע של הולדת \r\nשמיים בלי ציפור \r\nזרים ומבוצרים \r\nבלילה
  הסהור \r\nמול חלונך עומדת \r\nעיר טבולה בבכי הצרצרים \r\n\r\nובראותך כי דרך עוד
  צופה אל הלך \r\nוהירח על כידון הברוש \r\nאתה אומר אלי העוד ישנם כל אלה \r\nהעוד
  מותר \r\nבלחש בשלומם לדרוש \r\n\r\nמאגמיהם המים ניבטים אלינו \r\nשוקט העץ באודם
  עגילים \r\nולעד לא תיעקר ממני אלוהינו \r\nתוגת צעצועיך הגדולים\r\n"
transpoem: "Even a common sight has its moment of rebirth,\r\na sky devoid of birds,\r\nalien
  and entrenched \r\nagainst the moonlit night. Beyond your window lies\r\na city
  drowned by wailing crickets.\r\n\r\nAnd when you see the path extending on,\r\nthe
  road stares back at you,\r\nand the Moon\r\nimpaled on the spike of a cypress,\r\nyou
  ask “God, is it all still out there?\r\nMay we still seek it\r\nwith whispered tones?”\r\n\r\nThe
  water watches us from within its pools,\r\nthrough the resting trees\r\nwith their
  rouge blossoms.\r\n“Never take from me, God,\r\nthe sorrow of your monumental playthings.”"
note: "<p>Hebrew’s rigid grammatical structure and distinctive syntax lends itself
  to the creation of poetry. The relative dearth of definite articles and ease in
  compounding words allows authors to cut extraneous verbiage and contributes to the
  exact definition of subjects and agents. This exacting and gendered language proves
  difficult in translation, and ambiguity arises in literal translation. This rendition
  of “Moon” reformulates unclear syntax to preserve the original meaning while maintaining
  the line-breaks laid out by Alterman. Furthermore, in the original, each stanza
  contains a disrupted rhyme scheme, ABCAC, wherein the final syllable of each line
  is rhymed. Unfortunately, the sing-song quality of the original created by this
  rhyme scheme was lost in translation.</p>"
abio: "<p>Nathan Alterman was born to Jewish parents in Warsaw, Poland, in August
  1910. At the age of fifteen, he relocated to Tel Aviv, which was then under British
  mandate. Despite training to be an agronomist in France, he began a promising career
  as a poet, journalist, translator, and activist. Alterman became an active participant
  in the establishment of the State of Israel and the reclamation of Hebrew as its
  national language. His poetry narrates the Jewish people’s longing for a homeland
  and the sacrifices necessary to secure a brighter future. His voice was highly influential
  in the development of contemporary Israel consciousness, and his poem “The Silver
  Platter” (1967) is still traditionally performed on Israeli Independence Day. Alterman
  died in 1970.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Josh Glahn is a senior at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in English
  with an individualized concentration in narrative bioethics. Josh grew up with a
  variety of languages spoken around the house, including Biblical and Modern Hebrew.
  After high school, Josh spent a year in Israel at <em>Yeshivat Har Etzion</em> where
  he pursued Talmud and advanced Judaic studies.</p>"
