pid: repose
title: Giacere
transtitle: Repose
author: Antonia Pozzi
translator: Stephanie Diaz
poem: |-
  Ora l’annientamento blando
  di nuotare riversa,
  col sole in viso
  — il cervello penetrato di rosso
  traverso le palpebre chiuse —.
  Stasera, sopra il letto, nella stessa postura,
  il candore trasognato
  di bere,
  con le pupille larghe,
  l’anima bianca della notte.
transpoem: "Now the languid annihilation\nof swimming backstroke,\nthe sun in your
  face\n\tbrain interrupted by red \nacross eyes shut tight.\nTonight, on the sheets,
  in the same shape,\nthe moony candor\nof drinking,\nwith wide eyes,\nnight’s white
  life.\n"
note: |
  <p>I do not speak Italian, so this creating this translation was quite a trip! With the assistance of native speakers as well as Professor Silverman (who teaches a course on poetry translation at Penn), I was able to get a better feeling of the poem. In “Repose,” I focused on highlighting the intense physical sensations that Pozzi invokes in her version. In the line “– il cervello penetrato di rosso / traverso le palpebre chiuse –” Pozzi makes use of dashes to distinguish the sensation described from the rest of the piece. In my translation, I felt that, given the nature of the physicality of this line, it would be interesting to manifest this distinction in a more physical form. For this reason, I chose to indent the lines “brain interrupted by red / across eyes shut tight.”</p>
  <p>“Tonight, on the sheets, in the same shape,” was perhaps the hardest part of the poem to translate, as I really loved the repetition of <em>s</em> sounds in Pozzi’s version. While I didn’t manage to find an equivalent for “tonight” that had a similar sound, I worked to maintain the <em>s</em> and <em>sh</em> sounds in the rest of the sentence.</p>
abio: "<p>Antonia Pozzi was an Italian poet born in 1912 and died at the age of 26
  in 1938. After her death her father collected poems and letters written by Pozzi
  and assembled them in a book which he heavily censored. Most notably, Pozzi’s father
  made efforts to exclude mentions of Pozzi’s longtime lover and former teacher. Newer
  publications and translations of her work have made efforts to reduce these “edits”
  and present a version which is more in line with Pozzi’s poems.</p>"
