transtitle: As Much As You Can
author: C. P. Cavafy
translator: Josh Bryer
poem: "Κι αν δεν μπορείς να κάμεις την ζωή σου όπως την θέλεις,\r\nτούτο προσπάθησε
  τουλάχιστον\r\nόσο μπορείς: μην την εξευτελίζεις\r\nμες στην πολλή συνάφεια του
  κόσμου,\r\nμες στες πολλές κινήσεις κι ομιλίες.\r\n\r\nΜην την εξευτελίζεις πηαίνοντάς
  την,\r\nγυρίζοντας συχνά κ’ εκθέτοντάς την\r\nστων σχέσεων και των συναναστροφών\r\nτην
  καθημερινήν ανοησία,\r\nώς που να γίνει σα μια ξένη φορτική."
transpoem: "And if you cannot shape life to be what you want,\r\nat least try as much
  as you can\r\nnot to corrupt it\r\nby too much contact with the world, \r\nby too
  much activity and gossip.\r\n\r\nDo not corrupt it by hurrying it along,\r\ntaking
  it around and overexposing it \r\nto the daily idleness\r\nof social events and
  parties,\r\nuntil it becomes some strange duty."
note: '<p>The last line in the original poem reads “<span lang="el">ώς που να γίνει
  σα μια ξένη φορτική</span>.” A literal word-for-word translation renders “until
  it becomes like a strange burden/load/cargo.” This last noun, <span lang="el">φορτική</span>,
  evokes a material object, creating a poetic relationship between “it” (life) and
  physical weight. However, Cavafy is describing how best to shape a life that just
  does not seem to work out as planned: “try as much as you can / not to corrupt it…until
  it becomes like <span lang="el">μια ξένη φορτική</span>.” Though “a strange burden”
  also makes sense in English, the emphatic <span lang="el">μια</span> (“one,” “a)”
  and the intangibility of life suggest that <span lang="el">φορτική</span> carries
  the metaphorical weight of “duty” or “obligation.” A life that is not shaped as
  you would like becomes something unfamiliar — a burden, an obligation and duty.</p>'
abio: "<p>Famed for poems such as “Ithaka,” “Waiting for the Barbarians,” and “The
  City,” Constantine Petrou Cavafy was a Greek poet who lived from April 29, 1863,
  to April 29, 1933. Cavafy lived most of his life in Alexandria, where he was born
  and where he died, though he spent several years abroad in Britain and Constantinople.
  While alive, Cavafy published his poems in newspapers, periodicals, and annuals,
  only generating collections of his work upon request. Representative of the cosmopolitan
  Greek diaspora, Cavafy’s works appeal to international audiences. Cavafy’s works
  were first introduced to an English-speaking audience in 1919 and the first volume
  of his works was published posthumously in 1935. His poems broadly fit in three
  categories that, unsurprisingly, often overlap: historical, philosophical, and sensual.</p>"
tbio: "<p>At Penn, Josh Bryer studied classical languages and literature, learned
  modern Greek, and took classes in Hindi and Urdu. In the study of classical Greek
  and Latin, precision of translation is essential. However, such precision is often
  equated to substituting Greek or Latin words with their English equivalents as much
  as a dictionary entry will allow. Professor Taije Silverman’s translation of poetry
  course challenged his perception of the process of translation and, in turn, his
  understanding of how to accurately translate meaning; he learned that meaning is
  too often lost in word-for-word translation.</p>"
