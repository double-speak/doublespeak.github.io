note: "<h2>Interview conducted by Michaela Kotziers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Michaela
  Kotziers:</strong> I’d love to hear about how you came to translate Prado. I’m interested
  in whether you were on the hunt to translate Portuguese when you were in Brazil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ellen
  Watson:</strong> As soon as I knew I was going to live there for a year, I knew
  I wanted to find a Brazilian poet to translate. When I looked in bookstores in the
  little provincial town I was living in, I found they had a glut of male poets, and
  they didn’t appeal to me. My husband was working at the state university, University
  of Santa Catarina, at the time. The English department had a little magazine in
  which students translated poems from Portuguese into English; the students were
  struggling to translate a short poem of Adélia’s. They didn’t know which idiom in
  English to use, but I saw the English (they didn’t even print the Portuguese, I
  don’t think) and I thought, <em>This woman has that spark that I’m looking for</em>.
  And no one, when I asked around at home, had heard of her. So I definitely thought
  I was on to something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> That’s part of the
  really important work of translation, too, is introducing a poet whom no one else
  has been able to read yet. Turning to this very personal relationship that the two
  of you have, I’m interested in the way that you two connect despite having very
  distinct ways of being poets in the world. Prado has expressed that she’s an author,
  but she doesn’t really have interest in inhabiting the role of writer in the professional
  and public sense. She doesn’t quite make a career day-to-day of her writing, and
  she said in a BBC radio interview that “There’s my normal life, and then there’s
  poetry.” And then, on the other hand, you are very much a professional writer. You
  direct the poetry center at Smith, you teach writing workshops, you’re the Poetry
  and Translation Editor at the <em>Massachusetts Review</em>.  I’m wondering how
  this professional side affects your process of writing and if, when trying to understand
  where Prado’s coming from, if that ever felt like something that needed to be worked
  out.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Watson:</strong> No, not really. We have an incredible bond,
  and there are certain similarities in our fervor for different things. She is the
  spiritual person. I am not that spiritual. I mean, my first book was called <em>We
  Live in Bodies</em>, so that’s another reason that I gravitated towards her work:
  that it had the spiritual side but is so dedicated to and full of the body and daily
  life. For me, the struggle is more one of time. There’s never enough time in the
  week and the day and in anything to do editing and translating and my own writing.
  I guess I’ll just say that at a point when I was translating novels, I had to quit
  translating and not do any translating for a number of years in order to get my
  first book written. And people said, “Oh, you must be done translating.” And I said,
  “No, I’m a translator by heart. I’ve gotten that far into it. But I just have to
  find a way to make space to also write my own poems.” And I guess I’m a little bit
  of a workaholic in the way that I love the work that I do. When we’re in Divinopolis
  together, when we’re not working, she expects me to just go take walks, relax, and
  she’s like, “Why are you still working?” And I say, “Well, I’m preparing for our
  next session.” She kind of feels sorry for me, but I’m excited about this! So in
  those ways we’re different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> I’d like to
  request you to read “Where a Bird Is Also Nesting.” It’s from your book <em>Dogged
  Hearts</em>. It’s a poem that I felt really captured your relationship with Adélia
  Prado. \r\n\r\n<p><strong>Watson:</strong> And it really did start with this pineapple.
  [<em>Reads poem aloud.</em>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> The last line
  is still my favorite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Watson:</strong> I tear up when I say
  it. I mean, it’s true I am lucky to have these people in my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong>
  I’m wondering if we could talk a bit more about the process of your collaboration
  with Prado, in those sessions when you sat down at the table and you wrote with
  her because she doesn’t speak English. Could you talk about explaining your translations
  to her once they were written?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Watson:</strong> Well, I sort
  of paraphrased into Portuguese what I had on the page. After a while, when we both
  trusted each other and I trusted what I knew and knew what I didn’t, it was more
  of a matter of opening a book to a certain poem and me having my questions ready.
  There were times when there are references to Biblical moments and although I grew
  up with the Bible, it was a Protestant upbringing and I don’t remember it all that
  well, and so she would go to great lengths to bring out the Bible and show me what’s
  in it and the verse. We just sit there, and sometimes we get distracted and wander
  off somewhere else in our talking, and then I would say, “Ok, the next question
  is…” There was a time in her life when she kind of lost her faith for a while. She
  was clinically depressed and felt like her belief had somehow gotten frail, and
  she didn’t write for a number of years. She’s such a fervent believer that doubt
  wasn’t something that she could really accept. There are poems that refer to that,
  and we always talk about how much to reveal.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong>
  I can imagine that having known her poems so deeply and in a way that any other
  reader, without having spoken to her, wouldn’t quite know them, it would be difficult
  not to let that wander into your mind while you were translating and let it show
  too much, maybe even in ways that she hadn’t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Watson:</strong>
  Exactly. I didn’t want the poem to reveal more than she put in the poem. Whether
  she’d want that or not, it really should have been loyal to the poem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong>
  There’s a compromise in the process of choosing what to keep and what to omit. Not
  just on a line-by-line, stanza-by-stanza level, but also having to choose which
  poems from her volumes to publish in English. Could you speak to that process of
  deciding which poems to keep in?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Watson:</strong> Sometimes
  it was about poems just having a problem that makes it hard for them to work in
  English. For the things that get left behind, it was usually because they’re weaker
  poems. Occasionally she’d ask me, “Why didn’t you include this poem?” and I’d say,
  especially when it’s religious content, is that she is known for and unique in her
  ability to put not just the body and religion in the same book or poem — sex and
  belief — but for a counterbalance, a conflict. And some of her poems are just written
  in a moment of hallelujah, when she’s praising God, and it’s more likely they could
  be in a collection. But when they didn’t have images within them, when they didn’t
  have the daily in them, and then they ended with “Amen, Amen, Hallelujah,” I had
  a harder time putting them in with these other poems that were so much more substantial.
  I said to her that it’s that they’re less complicated. When I’m reading student
  poems or looking at my own poems or looking at peers’ poems, I’m looking for complexity.
  I’m looking for layers. When I’m putting a book together, I try to pick out what
  I think are the richest Adélia Prado poems.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong>
  I have some questions that are more specific to translation. Prado has said that
  what you must translate is the emotion. She has said, “I don’t care about the word.”
  I’m wondering how you reconcile such a liberal statement with the translator’s impulse
  to be more conservative or to meticulously consider every word and how it relates
  to the whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Watson:</strong> I think we make blanket statements
  to make a point, but I think what that really means is don’t put the word above
  the emotion. The words are still important. But because she’s not a veiled poet,
  if I don’t understand something, it’s my lack of cultural context or Portuguese
  faltering, and that’s sort of the easy part of the fix. Overall my goals in translating
  her were to create the same sort of energy and accessibility in her work. I think
  of her poems as inviting and also disconcerting, because they are very open-armed.
  I think that she’s very inventive in the way the poems move, and I want to keep
  that level of surprise and spontaneity, because they feel like they’re just happening
  as you read them, and that’s exactly what they are. She’s so genuine. She says things
  and she takes them back, but you know that she means them both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong>
  I’m wondering if I could ask you to read another poem, while we’re on the topic
  of choosing the right word. This one is called “The Birth of the Poem.” It’s in
  <em>Ex-Voto</em>, originally from Prado’s <em>O Pelicano</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Watson:</strong>
  [<em>Reads poem aloud.</em>] I like how she has it both ways. “Words stand for things.
  Things stand for nothing. Understanding comes like rapture. It’s the same as not
  understanding.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> I especially love the last
  line: “I didn’t build the pyramids. I am God,” as if we’re not building things;
  we’re just building poems and words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Watson:</strong> She
  says that poetry is the most human kind of communication. So although there’s the
  God side of it, there’s the human side of it. It’s the body. Poetry is the most
  human.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> Just reading her poetry you can
  see her spirituality, and she finds God in things, in every day. She’s not searching
  for it in churches and buildings. She’s just writing at a kitchen table.</p>\r\n<p>In
  another interview, you asked Prado if she thought metaphor was the guardian of reality,
  and if so, if translation could then be the guardian of metaphor. Could you elaborate
  on what you mean by “translation as guardian of metaphor”?</p> \r\n\r\n<p><strong>Watson:</strong>
  It’s like the business of saying I might have to change the image or metaphor to
  reflect more of the reality. So it’s the responsibility of what metaphor you choose.
  Maybe I’m interpreting it right now just in terms of translation and there’s a broader
  way of understanding it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> That makes sense
  to me, though, in terms of translation too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Watson:</strong>
  It’s so funny because we don’t think about the fact that the news cycle uses it.
  “Boots on the ground,” for example. I’m so sick of that. It dehumanizes boots. It’s
  people in those boots who are going to die. They don’t just say, “the troops.” We
  think in metaphors, but I think that’s not being the guardian of reality to say,
  “Boots on the ground.” That’s denying reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong>
  That’s almost doing a disservice to the kind of work that metaphor could be doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Watson:</strong>
  \ It’s not the most human form of communication that metaphor should be doing. It
  sounds catchy. And once it started happening, everyone now says that phrase and
  so many others like it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kotziers:</strong> I’m wondering,
  for translation to be the guardian of metaphor, do you feel like this means realizing
  that there are metaphors in every language? Is it preserving that this is a powerful
  thing we do in the way we think as humans?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Watson:</strong>
  In a way, it’s that you are a guardian, so you need to take it seriously. It’s the
  commonality, that it happens in both languages, but you have to be creative in order
  to preserve it. I think translation is not an intellectual act. I think it’s an
  act of poem-making, in which the metaphor is supreme.</p>"
