transtitle: Memories Watch Me
author: Tomas Tranströmer
translator: Rhosean Asmah
poem: |-
  En junimorgon då det är för tidigt
  aat vakna men för sent att somna om.

  Jag måste ut i grönskan som är fullsatt
  av minnen, och de följer mig med blicken.

  De syns inte, de smälter helt ihop
  med bakgrunden, perfekta kameleonter.

  De är så nära att jag hör dem andas
  fast fågelsången är bedövande.
transpoem: "A morning in June, too soon to wake\nyet too late to fall back asleep:\n\nI
  must go out into the greenery packed\nwith memories that follow me with their eyes.\n\nThey
  can’t be seen, they merge entirely\nwith the background, true chameleons. \n\nThey’re
  so close that I can hear them breathe\neven though the birdsong is deafening. "
note: |-
  <p>I translated Tomas Tranströmer’s “Memories Watch Me” without any familiarity with the original Swedish. As a result, my translation is based more on direct translations of individual words, in-class discussions of the poem, and my knowledge of the author rather than on my comprehension of the original poem.</p>
  <p>In the original, a period ends the first stanza, but I decided to end the stanza with a colon. The colon brings a cohesiveness to the translation, connecting the speaker’s experience to the memories and the June day. The second stanza of the poem was the most difficult for me to translate. The problem was not in conveying what the original poem was saying, but in structuring those ideas in English and fitting them into the rest of the translation. I played around with several arrangements, but ultimately settled on the current version because I felt that it sounded the most cohesive when read aloud. Other arrangements of that stanza that I read in other translations or tried to create myself were awkward and confused the meaning of the poem. My only concern for the current version is in the lack of punctuation, which could cause one to rush as they read it. Nevertheless, these decisions, among others, allow my translation of “Memories Watch Me” to both accurately represent my interpretation of Tranströmer’s thoughts and be pleasing to the ear.</p>
abio: "<p>Born in 1931, Tomas Tranströmer was a Swedish poet, translator, and psychologist.
  The publication of <em>17 dikter</em> (<em>17 Poems</em>), his first book of poetry,
  was well-received, and he went on to become one of the foremost Swedish poets of
  his generation. Tranströmer’s work is internationally acclaimed and has been translated
  into over sixty languages. His poetry is admired for its distinctive language and
  form, most evident in his use of metaphor and his concision. He chose to address
  ideas of human isolation, memory, and identity and to integrate them with images
  of nature. In 1990, Tranströmer suffered a stroke that left him paralyzed and robbed
  him of his ability to speak. Nevertheless, he continued to write poetry. In the
  same year, he received the Neustadt International Prize for Literature and in 2011,
  he received the Nobel Prize in Literature, for which he had been nominated every
  year since 1993. Tranströmer passed away in 2015 at the age of eighty-three.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Rhosean Asmah is a sophomore studying linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
  She has always been interested in languages and culture, which led her to take a
  class in poetry translation during her freshman year. She realized that she does
  like poetry and loves the challenge that comes with translating it. So far, she
  has only translated poems from languages she is unfamiliar with, but is currently
  working on poetry translations from French and Mandarin Chinese, both of which she
  studies.</p>"
