poem: "春花秋月何時了， \n往事知多少。\n小樓昨夜又東風，\n故國不堪回首月明中。\n\n雕欄玉砌應猶在，\n只是朱顏改。\n問君能有幾多愁，\n恰似一江春水向東流。\n\n<h3>Starting
  From the Title: Translating a Captured Ruler and His Captivating <em>Ci</em></h3>\n\n<p>The
  title of this poem has me stuck — not a good sign. Someone once said, “well begun
  is half done,” and I may have just jeopardized my shortcut.</p>\n\n<p>This title
  (“Yü Mei Ren”) can be rendered as “Fair Lady Yü” but this lady is not related to
  the poet, Li Yu. In fact, the title is irrelevant to the content of the poem — specifically,
  of the <em>ci</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As a traditional form of Chinese poetry, <em>ci</em>
  typically has a title that indicates the “set pattern” of the poem, which dictates
  the number of characters in each line, as well as their rhymes and tones (explained
  below). These set patterns initially evolved from lyrics of certain tunes, thus
  the restrictions, though the tunes themselves were lost in time. This particular
  tune is said to be written first for Xiang Yü’s (项羽, 232–202 BC) concubine, Yü (虞姬)
  (this is the Yü used in the title). Xiang Yü was a heroic leader of great nobility
  and virility, who led revolutions that overthrew the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC). Later,
  however, he suffered a tragic military defeat and committed suicide. Xiang foresaw
  this failure, and thus bid a final farewell to his beloved beautiful concubine,
  Yü, before going to the battlefield. The love and grief between Xiang and Yü, intertwined
  with the fate of a regime and the tragic heroism, are well known to native readers.
  In analyzing a <em>ci</em>, people typically attach no importance to the background
  of the title, because the set pattern can be used for a variety of unrelated themes,
  and the origin of some tunes can be obscure. Still, it would be fun to speculate
  whether Li Yu chose this set pattern with a little dark humor, about which readers
  may form their own judgment after reading the poet’s biography and the translation.</p>\n\n<p>But
  I hesitate to present such extraneous information before the reader gets to the
  content of the ci itself. On the other hand, if the translation of content is captivating,
  maybe the reader will seek out this information, and more.</p>\n\n<h3>Sound</h3>
  \n<p>The tones, which are strict, melodious, and crucial to the original poem, are
  not present in English — and in my opinion, impossible to render faithfully. There
  are four tones in Chinese, and most Chinese characters have only one of the four
  (some can have more than one tone, and people need to choose the most appropriate
  according to the context, e.g. the particular phrase a character is used in). In
  poetry, these four tones are divided into two categories, which we may call “even”
  and “oblique.” For every set pattern of Chinese poem, it is predetermined whether
  each character should be even or oblique. The tones therefore strongly limit the
  author’s choice of words. They, however, create a certain melody when one recites
  the <em>ci</em> in words. There are times I would try to recite a <em>ci</em>, but
  the words would get stuck on the tip of my tongue; I simply could not remember them.
  Yet the tones would still come to me spontaneously, and humming them was exhilarating.
  These were frustrating experiences, but they might speak to the significance of
  tones in appreciating a <em>ci</em>. On the other hand, studies show that humans
  selectively develop sensitivity to phonemes they are exposed to in the first twelve
  months after birth, and gradually lose the sensitivity to other phonemes (one reason
  why learning a second language can be so difficult, or why certain racial pejoratives
  were formed). While tones are different from phonemes, one’s attunement to and appreciation
  of tones likely rest on significant early exposure to them.</p>\n\n<p>Rhyme is another
  aspect that requires consideration in terms of the sound of <em>ci</em>. The rhyme
  scheme of “Yü Mei Ren” is in couplets, if you will, though the original probably
  did not have the format presented above, with line breaks and punctuations. Therefore
  I hesitate to use words like “verse” or “stanza,” for fear of unfaithfulness and
  of creating an illusion that non-English poetry maps perfectly onto English poetry.
  It may be important to note that the standard of rhyme also works slightly differently.
  In English, the full vowel and the ending consonant, if there is one, must match.
  Only the ending consonant, or vowel, matters in Chinese. In this poem, for example,
  <em>feng</em> and <em>zhong</em> rhyme because of the ending consonant <em>ng</em>,
  while <em>chou</em> and <em>liu</em> rhyme because of the ending vowel <em>u</em>.
  The conceptual and nomenclative mismatch goes even further. In fact, the word “poetry”
  itself creates ambiguities in indistinctively referring to <em>shi</em>, <em>ci</em>,
  and <em>qu</em>, three different genres of classical Chinese poetry.</p>\n\n<h3>Syntax</h3>
  \n<p>Classical Chinese is strange. Classical Chinese is beautiful. It has a great
  succinctness and vividness, both of which entice one to explore further. It is mesmerizing
  yet almost impossible to find an equivalent in English. Ezra Pound interestingly
  noted that one should use a proportionally antiquated language in translation, meaning
  that one should identify in the development of the target language a historical
  stage similar to that of the original language. While this notion sounds appealing
  at first, serious consideration reveals that it is impractical to compare the development
  of one language to that of another. What we take for granted today as modern Chinese
  originates from drastic social changes in China in the  early twentieth century,
  as a tool of breaking free from obsolete traditions and revolutionizing people’s
  ideologies. Before that, classical Chinese had various forms and levels of sophistication
  — even Li’s own poems before and after his capture show distinctive changes in vocabulary.
  Therefore, the issue is more complicated than choosing a linguistic period, as there
  can be significant variations in a period itself, and the wiggle room just gets
  smaller (for the interested reader, I highly recommend a translation by Jone A.
  Turner, S.J., who had a similar notion to Pound’s, and partially succeeded). Other
  than feasibility, is it fair to create either a pseudo-archaic or modern rendition
  of the original, and to let readers assume its authenticity? Here, I was initially
  fascinated by the idea of Vladimir Nabokov, who proposed that translations should
  be absolutely literary, with extensive footnotes that explain every feature of the
  original that was lost in translation. After I translated the poem that way, however,
  the fascination ceased — the extensive footnotes, like “skyscrapers” on the page,
  were pompous and intrusive; it was difficult to draw the line between conveying
  versus interpreting features; and most importantly, the process was like sloppily
  dissecting a poem and laying out the valuable parts for auction. Whatever remaining
  liveliness in the poem was gone once I announced my translation as “complete.” As
  a result, I decided to include a word-for-word translation for anyone who wants
  a glimpse of the original and removed all footnotes, except one.</p>\n\n<h3>Confession</h3>\n<p>The
  above is mostly my extended justification (and self-exoneration) for choosing not
  to preserve the form of the original, as I found no satisfying way to do so. Of
  course, my judgment was partly clouded by my affection for the original, which I
  learned to recite from a young age and which represents a dense and riveting cultural
  history to me. It was my deliberate choice to write the translation as a third-person
  narrative, since it allowed me to integrate the historical background into the translation
  rather than provide a separate and dry footnote that broke the reader’s immersion
  in the story. The specific plot with guards and a dream, however, was arbitrary
  — I scribbled down the scene immediately after it came into my head during a relaxing
  hot shower. I hope this turns out to be an accessible and enjoyable translation.</p>\n
  \n<p>Well, at least I managed to get away without a title.</p>\n"
transpoem: "Word-for-word Translation:\n\nSpring flowers, autumn moon, when will end?\nForegone
  things, know much or little.\nLast night, again, east wind in small pavilion,\nFormer
  country, in bright moonlight, bears not turning head back on. \n\nCarved railings,
  jade stairs, should still exist,\nOnly those crimson faces* have changed.\nAsk thee
  can have how much sorrow,\nJust like a river of spring tide eastward flow. \n\n*Literally
  translated from the original, “crimson faces” (<span lang=\"zh\">朱顏</span>) is a
  variation of “red faces,” (<span lang=\"zh\">紅顏</span>) possibly as a result of
  the poet’s effort to fit the tone of set pattern. “Red faces” is a common phrase
  to refer to beautiful young girls in classical Chinese and does not suggest embarrassment
  or exertion. \n\n<h1>Translation:</h1>\n\n<p>Li Yü, dressed in a coarse, gray robe,
  was in a plain room with bare wooden furniture. The windows, carved with shapes
  of flowers, clattered in the wind. Li stood up to open the window and looked out
  at the fresh green leaves and budding flowers in the yard. He stared at them for
  a moment without any expression of joy or sorrow, turned, and sat back down beside
  a low table, leaving the windows open. Against the closed doors, he could see shadows
  of two armed guards. “They are to protect the safety of your Highness,” he remembered
  being told when he surrendered his kingdom to the army just outside the city walls.
  “At least no more innocent people in the capital will die because of me,” he thought.
  “Ah, it’s the third year now.”</p>  \n\n<p>In a spring drowsiness, Li dozed off
  against the wall. In a rare dream, he was back in his carefree teenage years. He
  was never thought of as the next ruler, as his older brother was in line to succeed.
  Li indulged himself with the maidens’ dancing and singing, with poetry and painting,
  and with Buddhism. When his brother died unexpectedly, and he became the ruler,
  he was not too bothered either — he had even more freedom and resources to do what
  he liked. Pitiable were the officials who tried to divert his attention to politics
  and military affairs — they were simply executed.</p>\n\n<p>“Lunch!” a guard shouted
  as he barged into the room, holding a wooden tray with two bowls of plain buns and
  some pickles. Li, startled awake, silently watched the guard walking in, putting
  the plate on the table, and closing the door.</p>\n\n<p>“What are my people eating
  now?” Li found his thoughts wandering back to the dream a moment ago. “But it's
  not my country anymore.” He quickly self-corrected. “Yet, how many of them are still
  alive? What kind of life are they living? Hopefully better than mine, of course.
  The palace will probably still be there — it’s too magnificent and too much work
  to rebuild. Did they change the drapes, and throw away my writing? Ah, the talented
  maidens, they will probably never be as generously rewarded.”</p>\n\n<p>“Oh, this
  ruthless spring brings so much memory. But I shan’t blame the spring — how many
  more springs will I see? Ha. I used to say I knew of sorrow. Sorrow when an exquisite
  piece of music eventually ended, sorrow when my beloved wife died, sorrow when I
  couldn’t live long enough to read and write all the beautiful things. But now, now,
  I only long to see the Yangtze River one more time in the spring, with all its majestic
  tides, and let out a sigh.”</p>\n"
note: '<p>As one can see, this translation is in no way faithful to the form of the
  original. The original was created under a set pattern (<em>ci pai</em>, <span lang="zh">詞牌</span>)
  that predetermined the number of characters in every line as well as their tones
  and rhyme scheme. By compromising on word-for-word fidelity, rhyme, and original
  imagery, among other things, however, this expansion into a narrative prose has
  the advantage of integrating background information with the scene and emotion of
  the poem by using Li’s dream, which is purely imagined. I borrowed ideas from the
  original in recreating this scene. For example, flowers, which indicate the advent
  of spring, are engraved on the windows. Another important feature is that Li does
  not speak a word in this entire narrative, nor does he show any emotion. This reservedness
  and the guard’s disrespect towards Li imply his miserable current situation, as
  he lives under the mercy of the new ruler, and help to tangibly illustrate the sorrow
  beyond words. Li’s personal reflections (dead elder brother, love for Buddhism,
  execution of loyal officials, passion for music and dance) are historically true.</p> '
abio: |
  <p>Li Yu (<span lang="zh">李煜</span>, 937–978 CE) was the third and the last ruler of the Southern Tang regime during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960 CE). Li was not interested in politics, but rather indulged himself with the arts and sensual pleasures. He surrendered the capital to the ruler of the Song regime and lived under what we today may call home custody, though he did not live in his former home, the palace. This drastic change in his life circumstances resulted in a huge shift in the tone and content of his poems. Li switched from flowery descriptions of sensual pleasures to a more colloquial vocabulary and wrote laments about larger and heavier topics such as regime changes and the vicissitudes of life. His laments pioneered <em>ci</em>, a form of Chinese poetry. The stark contrast between his political incapability and his artistic genius makes Li a famous exemplar of the power of fate; people ponder the irony of the tragic destiny that turned him into one of the greatest Chinese poets of all time.</p>
  <p>This poem was written during the period of Li’s home custody, and it was speculated that the grief and lament in this poem contributed to the new ruler’s decision to poison Li.</p>

  science. Aside from amusing himself with imagination (like he has done here), he
  loves classical music, plays classical guitar, and also studies classics. How they
  all contain some form of “classic” is a completely irrelevant coincidence.</p>"
