title: 你不来，我不敢老去
transtitle: If You Don't Come Home, I'm Too Afraid to Age
author: Li Jizong
translator: Kejia Wang
poem: |-
  其实我已经老了
  我老得让门前的那棵小树替我掉叶子
  我老得掉了一层土
  又掉了一层土
  看到这些土
  我就知道，过去胸膛上给你预留的篝火快要熄灭了
  手臂上给你预留的力量快要离开了
  及至双眼，开始看什么都是缓慢的
  飘忽不定的
  其实我已经很老了
  及至这后来的一小段时光
  我只是继续让门前的那棵小树替我掉下最后一片叶子
  世易时移处
  我之所以说你不来，我不敢老去
  是没人的时候
  我非常渺茫地希望，你也在这么想
transpoem: "Truly, I have become old\nSo old that the small tree by the door is shedding
  for me\nSo old that I have shed a layer of dust\nand another layer of dust\n\nGazing
  at all the dust lets me grieve,\nthe bonfire I kept for you on my breast is dying\nthe
  strength I kept for you in my arms is departing\n— my eyes are starting to see the
  earth in slow motion\ndrifting in and out\n\nTruly, I have become very old\n— even
  in this following small stretch\nI only continue to let that small tree by the door
  \nshed its final leaf for me\nthe world turns and time goes on flying\n\nI say “if
  you don’t come home, I’m too afraid to age”\nbecause when the world is alone\nI
  still dimly wish that you are praying along"

  <p>I came across this poem of Li Jizong’s while browsing another Chinese amateur translator’s blog (<span lang="zh">黎历</span>/Lily) and was immediately struck by its lyricism and theme. As an international student living far away from home, I was touched by the melancholy of the (implied) parental speaker of the poem, especially since the poem was composed in my mother tongue. I want to bring this poem to Penn because I want to remind everyone in the Penn community of their aging parents and how they may miss us — even if the parent-child relationship is fraught, as it often turns out to be and often for good reason.</p>
  <p>To begin the translating process, I first produced a rough draft on my own, then compared it to the other translator Lily’s work. I anguished over “truly” versus “really” and “actually,” I anguished over the parallel structures in the original poem, I anguished over the long lines and over the use of time. The Chinese language’s employment of past and future tenses is quite ambiguous and I chose to value clarity over retaining the multitude of potential meanings. I owe my translation of line 14 (“the world turns and time goes on flying”) to Lily. The original Chinese has five characters (“world / change / time / move / location”) but Lily’s interpretation (“while the world is changing and time is flying”) reminded me of W. S. Merwin’s “Unknown Age” (“the bird lies still while the light goes on flying”), one of my favorite English-language poems, and gave me the inspiration to come up with my own translation of the line.</p>
abio: <p>Li Jizong (<span lang="zh">李继宗</span>) is a middle-aged contemporary Hui
  Chinese poet. Born and raised in Gansu in Northwestern China, he has been published
  in prestigious Chinese poetry journals from <em>Shikan</em> and <em>Shanhua</em>
  to <em>People’s Literature</em> and <em>Fangcao</em>. He is referred to as one of
  “Gansu Poetry’s Eight Riders.” Li’s poems are loved for their conciseness, lyricism,
  subtlety, and examination of the human condition. He is often compared to Li Bai
  at his most mundane introspective, and the absence of punctuation in his poetry
  reminds many of the work of W. S. Merwin.</p>

  speaking English. She graduated from Penn in 2016 with a BSE in bioengineering and
  a minor in English. She is now studying English and science and technology studies
  at the University of British Columbia.</p>"
