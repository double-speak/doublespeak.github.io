title: 走得太快的人
transtitle: The Man Who Walks Too Fast
author: Li Yuansheng
translator: Yi Feng
poem: "走得太快的人\n有时会走到自己前面去\n他的脸庞会模糊\n速度给它掺进了\n幻觉和未来的颜色\n\n同样，走得太慢的人 \n有时会掉到自己身后 \n他不过是自己的阴影\n有裂缝的过去\n甚至，是自己一直
  \n试图偷偷扔掉的垃圾 \n\n坐在树下的人\n也不一定刚好是他自己\n有时他坐在自己的左边  \n有时坐在自己的右边 \n幸好总的来说 \n他都坐在自己的附近\n"
transpoem: "The man who walks too fast\nsometimes passes himself\nHis face becomes
  obscure  \nSpeed is interwoven with \nillusions and the color of future\n\nSimilarly,
  the man who walks too slowly\nsometimes lags behind himself\nHe is just his own
  shadow\nEven the past with crevices\nbecomes the junk \nwhich he always wants to
  secretly throw away\n\nThe man sitting under the shade of a tree\nis not always
  himself\nSometimes he sits to the left of himself\nSometimes he sits to the right
  of himself \nFortunately\nhe always sits not too far from himself\n"
note: <p>This poem shows the fast pace of personal and national development in China
  at the end of the twentieth century. It also reflects the Confucian idea of <em>Zhong
  Yong</em> (<span lang="zh">中庸</span>), the doctrine of the mean, and shows the cultural,
  political, and social significance of Confucianism. When translating this poem,
  I changed the part of speech of some words in the original poem. For example, in
  the first line, the original Chinese poem used an adjective “fast-walking” (<span
  lang="zh">走得太快的</span>) to describe “the man,” but in my translation, I changed
  it into a verbal phrase “walk too fast” and put it in an attributive clause to describe
  the fast walking action of this man. Also, the direct translations of the last two
  lines are “Fortunately in general / he always sits near himself.” I omitted “in
  general” to make the English sentence flow better, and used “not too far from” rather
  than “near” to indicate that moderation is crucial in <em>Zhong Yong</em> (<span
  lang=”zh”>中庸</span>).</p>
