poem: "شہر کے گوشوں میں ھیں بکھرے ھوئے\nپا شکستہ سر بریدہ خواب\nجن سے شہر والے بے
  خبر!\n\nگھومتا ھوں شہر کے گوشوں میں روز و شب\nکہ ان کو جمع کر لوں \nدل کی بھٹی میں
  تپاؤں\nجس سے چھٹ جائے پرانا میل\nان کے دست و پا پھر سے ابھر آئیں\nچمک اٹھیں لب و
  رخسار و گردن\nجیسے نو آراستہ دولھوں کے دل کی حسرتیں\n!پھر سے ان خوابوں کو سمت رہ
  ملے \n\n\"خواب لے لو خواب ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔ \"\nصبح ھوتے ہی چوک میں جا کر لگاتا ھوں صدا
  ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔\n\"خواب اصلی ہیں کہ نقلی\"\nیوں پرکھتے ہیں کہ جیسے ان سے بڑھ کر \nخواب
  داں کوئی نہ ھو!\n\nخواب گر میں بھی نہیں\nصورت گر ثانی ھوں بس ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔ \nہاں مگر میری
  معیشت کا سہارا خواب ہیں!\n\nشام ھو جاتی ھے\nمیں پھر سے لگاتا ھوں صدا ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔\n\"مفت
  لے لو مفت، یہ سونے کے خواب ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔\"\n\"مفت\" سن کر اور ڈر جاتے ہیں لوگ\nاور چپکے
  سے سرک جاتے ہیں لوگ ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔\n\"دیکھنا یہ \"مفت\" کہتا ھے \nکوئی دھوکا نہ ھو!\nایسا
  کوئی شعبدہ پنہاں نہ ھو\nگھر پہنچ کر ٹوٹ جائیں\nیا پگھل جائیں یہ خواب\nبھک سے اڑ
  جائیں کہیں\nیا ھم پہ کوئی سحر کر ڈالیں یہ خواب ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔\nجی نہیں کس کام کے؟\nایسے
  کباڑی کے یہ خواب\nایسے نابینا کباڑی کے یہ خواب!\"\n\nرات ھو جاتی ھے \nخوابوں کے
  پلندے سر پہ رکھ کر\nمنہ بسورے لوٹتا ھوں\nرات بھر پھر بڑبڑاتا ھوں\n\"یہ لے لو خواب
  ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔\"\nاور لے لو مجھ سے ان کے دام بھی\nخواب لے لو، خواب ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔\nمیرے خواب
  ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔\nخواب ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔ میرے خواب ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔\nخو ا ا ا ا ب ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔\nان کے
  د ا ا ا ا م بھی ی ی ی ۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔۔\"\n\n"
transpoem: "In the corners of the city are \nScattered, broken, aimless dreams\nOf
  which the city-dwellers are unaware.\nI wander the corners of the city, morning
  and night,\nSo that I might compile them,\nReignite them in the forge of my heart,
  \nClear off old, accumulated dirt,\nSo that their hands and feet may emerge again,\nTheir
  lips and cheeks and necks arise with a sparkle,\nLike the unfulfilled desires in
  the heart of a newly adorned groom \nThat these dreams may again find direction.\n\n“Dreams,
  get your dreams—,”\nAs morning comes, I go to the square and give my call. \n“Are
  the dreams real or counterfeit?”\nThey investigate as if \nThere were no greater
  authority on dreams than them! \n\nA maker of dreams, I am neither\nA maker of the
  second face, nothing more\nAlthough, yes, the backbone of my livelihood is dreams\n\nEvening
  comes,\nAgain, I give my call \n“Free, completely free, these dreams of gold”\nUpon
  hearing “free,” people become even more fearful\nAnd wordlessly move away\n“Watch
  out; ‘free’ he says, \nMight it be a hoax?\nA hidden trick?\nThat they might break
  upon reaching home, \nOr that these dreams might melt,\nFly away in a puff of air,\nOr
  perform some sorcery upon us,\nOh no! What use are they?\nThese dreams of a mere
  scrap-dealer,\nThese dreams of a sightless scrap-dealer!”\n\nNight falls,\nWith
  stacks of dreams resting upon my head,\nI return with a dejected expression,\nAll
  night I again murmur,\n“Take these dreams…\nTake more…and take from me their cost
  as well…\nDreams, take these dreams…\nMy dreams…\nDreams oh my dreams…\nDreams…\nEven
  their cost”"
note: "<p>The translator’s dilemma is truly a world apart. On one hand, you feel the
  purest form of joy, sharing something so powerful and evocative to a whole new class
  of readers; on the other, you feel immeasurable loss for all the nuance and connotation
  that you somehow could not put on paper. There are questions every translator wrestles
  with: How true should one remain to source material versus the understood meaning
  of the work? Should line breaks happen as they are, or reflect the thoughts in the
  translated tongue? Is punctuation to be adjusted depending on the end language?</p>\n<p>In
  translating Noon Meem Rashid’s <span lang=\"ur\">اندھا کباڑی</span> (“Blind Scrap-Dealer”),
  I quickly came to realize that Rashid’s sonic mastery was something I would never
  be able to capture in my end product — I thus opted to keep the line breaks exactly
  where they were, to at least preserve the original form. Surveying the analogies
  and abstractions Rashid uses (likening his heart to a forge, to the sparkling dreams
  of a groom), I attempted to capture, more artfully, the larger metaphors he constructs.</p>
  <p>Choosing the tenses of the verbs in the first stanza was an active choice to
  highlight the narrative Rashid composes of the speaker himself reinvigorating the
  dreams. \nAdditionally, the notion of “the second face” was difficult to explain.
  Simply put, “the second face” implies an external representation or symbol. Essentially,
  the speaker is asserting that he simply burnishes and presents these dreams, giving
  them an external appearance, but is not responsible for the content, the essence
  of the dream itself. I thought it more appropriate to footnote this explanation
  than to change the expression that Rashidr uses.</p> \n<p>Without a doubt, the most
  difficult part of translation was the title and the subject of the poem. <span lang=\"ur\">کباڑ</span>,
  in Urdu, roughly translates to “scraps” or “rubbish,” and one who collects said
  scraps and sells them is a <span lang=\"ur\">کباڑی</span>. In Pakistan, such individuals
  wheel around their goods, hawking their wares to people. Thus follows the plot of
  the poem: this scrap-dealer, whose call for dreams exists in the same form of a
  milkman, fruit-seller, or any other street merchant who might be passing through.
  It was not even that the equivalent word did not exist, but that the very concept
  did not exist in the English language or Western culture. Rather than alter the
  fabric of the work, I chose to include this explanation instead.</p>"
abio: <p>Noon Meem Rashid (<span lang="ur">نذر مُحَمَّد راشِد</span>, 1910–1975) was
  a Pakistani poet and writer noted for his progressiveness and rich, adventurous
  use of language. He served in the Royal Indian Army, and, after Independence, worked
  with Radio Pakistan before going on to work for the UN for the remainder of his
  career. Writing at a time when much of Pakistan’s literary community was harkening
  back to the Arab roots of Urdu, Rashid chose to highlight the Persian influence
  on Pakistan and Urdu. His language is layered with modern Persian verbiage and displays
  a mastery of sound that defies simple explanation. This very poem has a rhythmic
  rise and fall, a natural flow of language that rolls like honey off the tongue.
  Coupled with the abstractness with which Rashid examined the topics of free will,
  oppression, love, and beauty, his work emerged as the first marker of “modernist”
  Urdu poetry. Rashid also became the first prominent user of free verse in Urdu poetry,
  rebelling against the traditional <em>ghazal</em> format in Urdu poetry. He passed
  away in 1975, at the age of sixty-five, and asked to be cremated after his death
  (as opposed to the traditional Muslim burial), a hard-line individualist till the
  end.</p>
tbio: "<p>Armghan Ahmad is a senior in Wharton studying finance and marketing. An
  avid lover of all things written, he can trace his passion for poetry to his family:
  to his grandmother, who would put him in her lap and regale him with stories and
  poems from her hometown of Agra, and to his parents, who would often quote poetry
  to each other at the dinner table and give him endless books to read. In his free
  time, Armghan enjoys taking photos, running along the Schuylkill trail, and waxing
  on about the cinematic masterpiece that is <em>Manchester by the Sea</em>.</p>"
