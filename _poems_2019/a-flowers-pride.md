translator: Peeriya Pongsarigun and John Viano
poem: "สตรีมีสองมือ   \t\tมั่นยึดถือในแก่นสาร\nเกลียวเอ็นจักเป็นงาน    \t\tมิใช่ร่านหลงแพรพรรณ\n\tสตรีมีสองตีน
  \   \t\tไว้ป่ายปีนความใฝ่ฝัน\nยืนหยัดอยู่ร่วมกัน    \t\tมิหมายมั่นกินแรงใคร\nสตรีมีดวงตา
  \   \t\tเพื่อเสาะหาชีวิตใหม่\nมองโลกอย่างกว้างไกล    \t\tมิใช่คอยชะม้อยชวน\nสตรีมีดวงใจ
  \   \t\tเป็นดวงไฟมิผันผวน\nสร้างสมพลังมวล    \t\tด้วยเธอล้วนก็คือคน\nสตรีมีชีวิต
  \   \t\tล้างรอยผิดด้วยเหตุผล\nคุณค่าเสรีชน     \t\t\tมิใช่ปรนกามารมณ์\n\tดอกไม้มีหนามแหลม
  \   \tมิใช่แย้มคอยคนชม\nบานไว้เพื่อสะสม    \t\tความอุดมแห่งแผ่นดิน"
transpoem: |-
  A woman’s hands hold firmly
  the righteousness of which she is worthy.
  Her muscles create a masterpiece.
  She is not bewitched by golden fleece.

  A woman’s feet climb up to her dreams;
  Determined and brave, she seems.
  She loves her people and fights like a warrior —
  not giving up until the war is over.

  A woman’s eyes look toward a better life.
  The world is too big just to be someone’s wife.
  She sees the world as if it were hers,
  not wasting time seducing men — as they might prefer!

  A woman’s heart is determined for success.
  Her strong heart leads to genuine progress.
  She works hard; her hands are never free,
  to prove she is as human as a man can be.

  A woman’s life tells right from wrong.
  She has her seasons; she stands strong.
  She deserves her rightful freedom —
  to decide for whom to show her blossom.

  A flower has thorns for protection.
  A flower does not make false pretensions.
  A flower blooms, like a woman, not a girl.
  She stands for herself, and changes the world.

  <p>The original poem was written using a Thai rhyme-scheme called <em>Kapyani 11</em>, in which each line consists of two parts, with the first part containing five syllables and the second containing six — making for eleven syllables per line. Each stanza is made up of two lines and the last syllable of each stanza must rhyme with the last syllable of the first line of the next stanza. It may sound complicated, but <em>Kapyani 11</em> is actually one of the simplest forms of Thai poetry. Below is a further illustration of the <em>Kapyani 11</em> style. Like font effects indicate rhyming syllables.</p> <p>Satri mi chi<b>wit</b> lang roi <b>phit</b> duay het phon</p>
  <p>Khunkha serichon mi chai pron kama<em>rom</em></p>
  <p>Dokmai mi nam laem mi chai yaem khoi khon chom</p>
  <p>Ban wai phuea sa<em>som</em> khwan u<em>dom</em> haeng phandin</p>
  <p>As is seen above, the fifth and the eighth syllables of each line rhyme,\ and the eleventh syllable of the first line of the couplet continues the scheme by rhyming with the fifth syllable of the second line.</p> <p>We chose to translate the poem into couplets because they are simple and easy to read. We kept the use of the pronouns “she” and “her” as in the original, as well as the use of a flower to symbolize women and womanhood. We adapted many of the Thai idioms with devices or constructions of similar semantic and visual value in English, such as “She is not bewitched by golden fleece” or “to decide for whom to show her blossom.” In Thai, the two phrases literally mean “She is not excited by beautiful clothes” and “Not men’s banquet,” respectively. In English, the use of the literal phrases would drastically reduce the intelligibility of the translation while also depriving the reader of the original’s visual intensity. Hence, we endeavored to make the literary imagery as sharp in translation as in the original, while doing our best to preserve the sense of sound and rhythm that gives the poem its full power.</p>
abio: "<p>Chiranan Pitpreecha is a famous Thai writer and poet. She was a student
  at Chulalongkorn University and was one of the leaders of the October 1973 pro-democracy
  student movement against the military government in Thailand. She, with thousands
  of other Thai students, fled to the jungle in the aftermath of the October 6, 1976,
  massacre at Thammasat University, Thailand’s “Tiananmen Square” moment. During the
  massacre, the Royal Thai Police, the Royal Thai Border Police, the Royal Thai Military,
  and civilian paramilitary forces surrounded and invaded the Thammasat University
  campus under “free-fire” orders, resulting in the deaths of an untold number of
  unarmed student protesters, many of whom were killed trying to surrender to authorities.
  Their bodies were hung from the trees on campus and left for the public to deface.
  Pitpreecha later joined the Communist insurrection as well. She wrote a lot of feminist
  and left-wing poetry while hiding from authorities in the jungle. Pitpreecha returned
  from the jungle in 1981 and resumed her education at Cornell University, where she
  received a BA and MA in history. <em>The Missing Leaf</em>, her first book of poetry,
  which was based on her experience in the jungle, won the prestigious South East
  Asia Write Award in 1989. <em>A Flower’s Pride</em> is one of the main poems in
  <em>The Missing Leaf</em>.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Peeriya is a native speaker of Thai and a current Fulbright Teaching Assistant
  grantee at the University of Pennsylvania. John is an American fluent in Thai and
  a researcher affiliated with Chulalongkorn University. Together, we have translated
  more than one hundred children’s books, principally from Thai to English, as well
  as song lyrics and poetry. Most recently, we won third place for poetry in the <em>Bangkok
  Literary Review</em>’s 2018 Translation Prize (and were subsequently published).
  All in all, we excel in creating English language rhyme schemes that echo those
  of the Thai sources while faithfully communicating the author’s message.</p>"
