poem: |
  j’eus dix ans le ciel en tête
  j’empruntai ses ailes au soleil
  pour voler vers ce lieu entre deux rives

  j’élevai des tours de sable
  qu’habitait l’ombre qui me servait de corps

  corps mûri par un soleil d’extrême été
  j’étais dans la pensée du vent
  les tons de la lumière
  composaient mon paysage

  j’étais dans la couleur du jour
  je grimaçais avec les pierres
  où s’abritaient les scorpions
  dans l’île les femmes portaient un masque
  peut-être par pudeur

  le ciel en tête je me faisais invisible
  pour mieux voir frappais aux vitres
  où se rassemblait le jour
  en un hymne quotidien
  je cherchais un sens à la forme –
  au-delà le monde devait exister

  j’eus vingt ans impatiente
  d’aborder des continents neufs
  je quittai la maison de mon père
  livrai à la lumière ma liberté d’oiseau
  entrai dans l’espace de l’obscur

  je cherchai à ouvrir des portes invisibles
  affirmai lire la matière même du silence
  comme une langue natale
  fis du passé un commencement
  et du présent une double absence

  corps vivant plus que mort
  je refusais que la nuit me sépare
  du jour et le jour de la nuit

  veilleur du rêve que le rêve invente
  que cherchais-je lorsque j’ouvrais les yeux
  sur les couleurs du monde
  que jamais ne perd de vue le soleil

  de la mémoire seconde des mots
  naît l’émotion la plus réelle
  j’habite cette musique
  que je ne puis être seule à entendre

  ombre qui suit ou précède son ombre
  aux frontières entre rêve et réel
  je demeure en marge de moi-même
  dans l’espace et dans le temps

  comment savoir si en ce lieu
  de nulle part où se libère la voix
  je suis venue de moi-même
  ou s’il s’est imposé
transpoem: "i borrowed the wings of the sun\nto fly towards that place between two
  rivers\n\ni raised towers of sand\nin which lived the shadow that acted as my body\n\nbody
  ripened by the fervid summer sun \nthe wind thought of me  \ntones of light\ncomposed
  my landscape\n\ni hid in the shade of day \ni frowned with the stones\nwhere scorpions
  sheltered\non the island, women wore masks\nperhaps out of modesty\n\nsky in the
  head, i would make myself invisible\nfor clear sight knocked on the windowpane\nwhere
  it gathered the day\ninto a quotidian hymn\ni was searching for meaning in its shape
  —\nbeyond, the world left existence\n\ni was twenty years old impatient\nto reach
  new continents\ni left the house of my father\ndelivered my winged freedom to the
  light \nentered the space of the obscure\n\ni looked to open the invisible doors\nknowing
  to even read silence\nlike a mother tongue\nmaking the past the beginning\nand the
  double absence the present\n\nbody more alive than dead\ni refused to let night
  separate me\nfrom the day or the day from the night\n\nwatchman of the dream that
  the dream invents\nwhat was i searching for when i opened my eyes\nto the colors
  of the world \nthat the sun never loses sight of\n\nfrom the second memory of words\nthe
  most real emotion is born\n\ni inhabit this music\nwhich i can’t be the only one
  to hear\n\nshadow which succeeds or precedes its shadow\nupon the boundaries between
  dream and real\ni dwell on the margin of myself \nin space and in time\n\nhow can
  i know if in this nowhere, \nwhere the voice frees itself,\nif i came from myself\nor
  was imposed.\n"

  <p>This year, we include a chain translation done by the <i>DoubleSpeak</i> staff to demonstrate how many people can contribute to one translation. Each staff member translated about five lines, then we translated the last stanza together. We found it fascinating to watch the translation develop as each individual put in their own piece — aligning our own perception of the poem to the spirit of the poem itself <i>and</i> to others’ perceptions was challenging, but it allowed us to explore the boundaries of the self and others. We asked ourselves: How can we translate the poem’s focus on physicality? How can we capture the spirit of the language without any familiarity of its spirit? How would that spirit change our own expression?</p>
  <p>The first line of the poem was difficult to translate. What exactly does it mean for one’s head to be “full of sky”? Is it whimsy at the nature of the world? A means of distraction? A reference to imagination and fleeting youth? Portrayals of nature’s beauty follow this “head in the sky,” with references to “wings of the sun,” “two rivers,” and “towers of sand,” alluding to nature’s magnificent power instead of the hands of humankind.</p>
  <p>We also struggled with “I hid in the shade of day,” as the literal translation was “I was the color of day.” The sky is blue or white during the daytime but day seems like a colorless thing. So, we translated it as “I hid in the shade of day” because being the color of something colorless is the same as being invisible. Later in the stanza, the narrator mentions masks, so our translation makes the stanza more cohesive, even though the poem as a whole feels a bit fragmented.</p>
  <p>Throughout the poem, the narrator grapples with her relation to the world around her. This is why we translated “j’étais dans la pensée du vent” — literally “I was in the thought of the wind” — as “the wind thought of me.” This decision places the narrator in a position of power: instead of being consumed by the wind, the wind makes the vulnerable decision to think of her.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, through this process, we found ourselves each becoming a scrap of the translation and the poem becoming us.</p>
abio: "<p>Amina Saïd, born in Tunis in 1953, was raised by a Tunisian father and a
  French mother and grew up speaking both Arabic and French. A voracious reader of
  novels, Saïd began seriously writing after her middle school French teacher persuaded
  her to write poetry. She wrote poems throughout the remainder of her schooling and
  obtained her baccalaureate degree in Paris after moving to France with her family
  at the age of sixteen. Saïd continued to delve into the world of language during
  university, deciding to study English literature instead of forcing herself to choose
  between the literatures of her native languages. However, she still draws inspiration
  from both French and Arabic works. She started publishing her own poetry in her
  twenties and has translated novels by Francisco Sionil José. Her published works
  include collections of Tunisian folk tales and eight volumes of poetry which have
  been translated into Arabic, German, Italian, Spanish, and English. Honored in France
  with the Jean Malrieu Prize in 1989 and the Charles Vildrac Prize in 1994, Saïd
  has lived in Paris since 1978. She continues to write poetry and currently works
  as a journalist, often visiting her homeland of Tunis.</p>"
tbio: "<p><em>DoubleSpeak</em>’s editorial staff is a combination of strong individuals.
  We love translating and writing and eating cheese and desserts and fava beans and
  being with other strong language enthusiasts who translate and write and love. We
  come from Palm Beach Gardens, Florida; Lubbock, Texas; Dublin, California; Tampa,
  Florida; and Hangzhou, China; Bergenfield, New Jersey; Cortlandt Manor, New York;
  and Philadelphia. Between us, we speak Gujarati, Spanish, Mandarin, Korean, French,
  Japanese, Russian, Hebrew, Italian, and German. And we are forevermore mesmerized
  by the wonders of language, exploration, and discovery.</p>"
