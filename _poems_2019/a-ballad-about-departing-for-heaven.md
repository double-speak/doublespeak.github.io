transtitle: A Ballad about Departing for Heaven
author: Vladimir Vysotskii
translator: Dan Guralnik
poem: |-
  Вот твой билет. Вот твой вагон.
  Всё в лучшем виде, одному тебе дано.
  В цветном раю увидеть сон,
  Трёхвековое непрерывное кино.

  Всё позади. Уже сняты
  Все отпечатки, контрабанды не берём.
  Как херувим стерилен ты.
  А класс второй — не высший класс — зато с бельём.

  Вот и сбывается всё что пророчится.
  Уходит поезд в небеса, счастливый путь!
  Ах, как нам хочется, как всем нам хочется,
  Не умереть, а именно уснуть!

  Земной перрон, не унывай!
  И не кричи: для наших воплей он оглох.
  Один из нас уехал в рай,
  Он встретит бога если есть какой-то бог.

  Он передаст ему привет.
  А позабудет — ничего, переживём!
  Осталось нам не много лет,
  Мы пошустрим, и, как положено, умрем.

  Вот и сбывается всё что пророчится.
  Уходит поезд в небеса, счастливый путь!
  Ах, как нам хочется, как всем нам хочется,
  Не умереть, а именно уснуть!

  Не всем дано поспать в раю,
  Но кое-что мы здесь успеем натворить.
  Подраться, спеть — вот я пою! —
  Другие любят, третьи думают любить.

  Уйдут как ты в ничто без сна,
  И сыновья, и внуки внуков в трех веках.
  Не дай Господь, чтобы война,
  А то мы правнуков оставим в дураках!

  Вот и сбывается всё что пророчится.
  Уходит поезд в небеса, счастливый путь!
  Ах, как нам хочется, как всем нам хочется,
  Не умереть, а именно уснуть!

  Тебе плевать! И хоть бы хны:
  Лежишь, миляга, принимаешь вечный кайф!
  Что до меня, такой цены
  Я б не дал даже за хороший книжный шкаф.

  Разбудит Вас какой-то тип,
  И впустит в мир, где в прошлом войны, вонь и рак.
  Где побеждён Гонгконгский грип.
  На всём готовеньком ты счастлив ли, дурак?

  Ну а пока, звенит звонок.
  Счастливый путь, храни тебя от всяких бед.
  И если там и вправду Бог,
  Ты всё-же вспомни, передай ему привет.
transpoem: "Here’s your ticket. There’s your car.\nThe best we’ve got, it’s all for
  you alone.\nTo visit heaven, dream in color\nAn endless iMax film for when you’re
  gone…\n \nNow all’s arranged, your papers cleared,\nNo luggage? Good! We take none
  anyway.\nYou’re finger-printed, washed and rinsed.\nThe seat’s just coach, but it
  reclines so well!\n  \nAll that’s foretold comes to transpire:\nThe Train for Heaven
  leaves: farewell, godspeed!\nOh, how we crave, how strongly we desire\nNever to
  die, but gently fall asleep.\n \nYou, back on earth, do not despair!\nAnd save your
  cries — we do not have his ear.\nHe’s bound for heaven, paid his fare,\nHe’ll meet
  his maker, if that maker’s here.\n \nHe’ll pass to god our best regards;\nShould
  he forget, it’s not of much concern:\nWe don’t have long to stay alive;\nWe'll have
  some fun until the train returns.\n \nAll that’s foretold comes to transpire:\nThe
  Train for Heaven leaves: farewell, godspeed!\nOh, how we crave, how strongly we
  desire\nNever to die, but gently fall asleep. \n\nNot everyone is heaven-bound.\nThose
  left behind could still protest their fate:\nGo start a brawl, or join my song,\nPerhaps
  make love, or merely contemplate.\n \nLike you, we’ll step into the void,\nAs our
  children, great-grandchildren stay behind\nOh god, I wish there won’t be wars\nOr
  we will shamelessly have screwed them over now!\n\nAll that’s foretold comes to
  transpire:\nThe Train for Heaven leaves: farewell, godspeed!\nOh, how we crave,
  how strongly we desire\nNever to die, but gently fall asleep.\n \nYou do not care!
  You will not budge –\nJust lying there forever blissful and detached.\nYou’ve overpaid,
  if I’m to judge:\nEven my library won’t fetch that much!\n \nYou’ll be awoken by
  some dude,\nwho’ll greet you to a world devoid of struggle, stench and dread. \nNo
  wars, no plague, no solitude,\nHow happy can you be when all is ready-made?\n\nAh
  well, meanwhile, the whistle screams.\nGodspeed! Let no harm come your way.\nAnd,
  just perhaps, if god exists,\nDo not forget to tell him we said, “Hey!”"
note: "<p>My translations grow out of a deep dissatisfaction with available translations
  of Vysotsky’s work into English. The better ones are so academic they remind me
  of a quote from Milos Forman’s <i>Amadeus</i>: “Come on now, be honest! Which one
  of you wouldn’t rather listen to his hairdresser than Hercules? Or Horatius, or
  Orpheus…people so lofty they sound as if they shit marble!” On one hand, knowing
  Russian as a mother tongue and having been raised on stories about the USSR — good
  and bad — and knowing scores of Vysotsky’s songs by heart makes it hard to believe
  that Vysotsky would ever approve of such <em>haut-couture</em> translations. On
  the other hand, Vysotsky’s gift for juggling the Russian language and harnessing
  its cultural references that span centuries of human experience make most fan-made
  translations too banal and discolored despite the earnest attempt to convey his
  emotional range.</p>\n<p>My goal was to translate the poem while preserving its
  emotional range, rhythm, and measure, so it could be sung in English as a song to
  the same melody as the original and understood by my American friends and family.
  My solution was to make use of colloquial language, as you may have well noticed.
  Here are some notes/examples:</p>\n<p>The chorus is still too academic. I’d love
  to see something simpler replace the “transpire”–“desire” pair, even more so when
  I think of the corresponding pair in the original (<em>sbyvaets’a/prorochits’a –
  hochets’a</em>), which is a simpler rhyme, based on the repetition of a ubiquitous
  suffix.</p>\n<p>A few details in the song, such as those relating to the experience
  of boarding a long-range train in Russia (one aboard which you’re about to spend
  days to weeks, where you will require towels and linen, and you’d like those to
  be clean…), have been replaced with analogous, more contemporary, symbols of comfort
  that are also more available and/or relevant on this side of the Atlantic. Just
  one line (the fourth line of the second verse) is given for conveying the train
  experience, with Vysotsky counting on the listener to conjure up their own memories
  thereof; in the US, I think, it is easier to ask you to recall how much leg room
  you had on your latest flight…</p> \n<p>Similarly, the phrase <em>kakoj-to tip</em>,
  which could have been treated in standard English as a general reference to “some
  stranger” (and usually is, as a brief online search for translations of this song
  will demonstrate), is better conveyed by “some dude,” because the latter does carry
  with it the necessary modicum of repulsion/disrespect.</p>\n<p>I am certain that
  better, much better, translations are possible. Perhaps my conclusion from working
  on this one should be that translation is not merely about rewriting sentences in
  another language: it is about the communication of whole experiences. In the case
  of Vladimir Vysotsky, who dedicated his writing to the experience of life by less
  fortunate people, and who finds his roots in the study of song in Russian criminal
  culture (<em>blatnye pesni</em>), translating his work into English may be better
  served by the loose and laden language of the American Midwest than by the standard,
  literary English language. My sincere thanks to the editorial team of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>
  for a very helpful discussion!</p>"
abio: "<p>Vladimir Vysotskii (1938–1980) was an accomplished actor and one of the
  famous singer-songwriters of post-WWII Soviet culture who survived the blockade
  of Leningrad as a child and was greatly influenced by the societal and cultural
  effects of the Second World War. Having witnessed the crash of patriotic Stalinism
  as a teenager, the “warming” (<em>ottepel’</em>) of Khruschev times and finally,
  the “stagnation” (<em>zastoj</em>) during Brezhnev, Vysotskii, in his poetry and
  song, casts a wide net of empathy over the “simple folk” (<em>prostoj narod</em>)
  mocked by the Soviet intellectual elites, the homeless war orphans forced into crime,
  the millions of wounded and bereaved WWII soldiers, and the oppressed non-conformists
  (<em>inakomysl’aschij</em>) who were tortured and disposed of by a regime whose
  ends justified all means. Love, death, and the love and beauty of life are themes
  woven intricately into every poem written by Vysotskii, with his song renditions
  of these poems so emotionally overwhelming – even in his comical writing – that
  his resulting popularity made it impossible for the Soviet regime to suppress his
  concerts (which started out as unofficial “evenings with friends”) or even his calling
  out the most vile practices of Brezhnev’s regime, such as imprisonment of political
  foes in psychiatric wards (see, e.g., the song <em>Oshibka Vyshla</em>). What made
  him still acceptable in the Soviet regime may have been a deeper, non-trivial side
  of his longing for true freedom for his people, its young culture, and its ideals.
  The Soviet regime had made it impossible for him to look up to the West, in whose
  political culture he could see other, no less powerful, patterns of oppression (see
  songs <em>Temnota, Misteriya Hippi</em> and the most overt <em>Pesnya o mistere
  McKinley</em>).</p>"

  <p>My name is Dan Guralnik. I am a mathematician working on geometric/topological methods for knowledge representation at Kod*Lab (Penn ESE) and am with Robert Ghrist’s group at the department of mathematics. I was born in Israel in 1975, raised by my Russian-Jewish parents, who introduced me to Vysotskii when I was about nine (or was it ten?) years old. He was a hero to them.</p>
  <p>I moved to the US at the age of thirty, my first six years spent in the “Bible Belt” (specifically Vanderbilt and the University of Oklahoma), where I learned many new things about English. This weekend is yet another anniversary of my dad’s passing (11/17/1939–10/20/2001) of lung cancer. Like every cool dude in his days (Vladimir Vysotskii included), Dad used to smoke a lot. The song I’ve attempted to translate here is the song I played for the small gathering at his funeral – a song celebrating life in what seems a singularly Russian way, painting heaven as the best of all worlds, save one: ours.</p>
