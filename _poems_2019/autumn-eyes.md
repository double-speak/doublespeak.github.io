pid: autumn-eyes
title: Herbstaugen
transtitle: Autumn Eyes
author: Hilde Domin
translator: Dillon Bergin
poem: |-
  Presse dich eng
  an den Boden.

  Die Erde
  riecht noch nach Sommer,
  und der Korper
  riecht noch nach Liebe.

  Aber das Gras
  ist schon gelb über dir.
  Der Wind ist kalt
  und voll Distelsamen.

  Und der Traum, der dir nachstellt,
  schattenfussig,
  dein Traum
  hat Herbstaugen.
transpoem: "Press yourself close\nto the ground.\n\nThe earth\nstill smells like summer\nand
  your body\nstill smells like love.\n\nBut the grass \naround you is already yellow.\nThe
  wind is cold\nand full of thistledown.\n\nAnd the dream that chases you\non the
  shadows of your feet — \nyour dream\nhas autumn eyes."
note: "<p>I didn’t have to compromise too much while translating this poem. Its simple
  words are, for the most part, easily felt in their English counterparts. This is
  why I kept a very direct translation in all but a few cases.</p> <p>However, there
  are a few lines and words I struggled with. Lines like “Aber das Gras / ist schon
  gelb über dir.” were tricky. It’s a seemingly direct statement, but even in German
  this sentiment comes off as odd or uncommon. I translated it into English with a
  phrase less bizarre to English ears, but I think I could still find a better way
  of making the line sound as striking and unfamiliar in English as it does in German.
  <em>Distelsamen</em> was also difficult for me to translate. <em>Distelsamen</em>
  literally translates to “thistledown” in English, but most English speakers don’t
  know what thistledown is, while most German speakers know or assume what <em>Distelsamen</em>
  is (though I might have to check with a larger sample size on this). I initially
  translated <em>Distelsamen</em> as “pollen,” although thistledown isn’t pollen.
  Thistledown are the little white fuzzy things that drift in the air duringfall.
  Most people know exactly what this is, but don’t have a word for it, or would guess
  that they’re from dandelions, which also isn’t true. Additionally, the word <em>schattenfussig</em>
  is of typical German construction — part of the beauty of the language — but awkward
  in English. It literally means “shadowfooted,” which isn’t a word in English and
  doesn’t reflect common adjective constructions in the language either.</p> <p>On
  the other hand, there were also many victories in my translation. I was impressed
  with how beautiful “Autumn Eyes” sounds in English, which really does “Herbstaugen”
  justice. I was also very happy with how the plain and immediate language of the
  poem in German fit well structurally in the shape and length of the English translation.
  A problem with translating German is that, due to word construction freedoms, a
  single German word can correspond to a whole sentence or phrase in English. Usually,
  such lengthiness can potentially botch the flow of a poem, but the English translation
  turned out nicely. Overall, I tried to translate this poem with the natural, concrete
  language and emotions that I feel when reading it in German.</p>"
abio: "<p>In 1909, Hilde Domin was born as Hilde Löwenstein in Cologne to a Jewish
  family. She began her university studies in law and economics, then studied philosophy
  and political science. In Germany, she studied in Heidelberg, Cologne, and Berlin.
  However, Domin’s Jewish background and socialist involvement were good reason to
  leave Germany in 1932. She moved to Italy, where she received her PhD in political
  science in Florence. There, she met her future husband, Erwin Palm. The two survived
  “literally on language” — Domin taught language courses and translated the scholarly
  writings of her husband. In 1939, the couple fled to Santo Domingo. The city’s name
  inspired the last name of Domin’s pen name, “Domin.” In Santo Domingo, Domin’s husband
  became an art history professor and she began writing in German as an “alternative
  to suicide.” The terrifying paradox of her life was that she had escaped to an island
  paradise while many of her friends and family were forced into hell on Earth. After
  the war, Domin moved back to Heidelberg where she became a professor and lived until
  her death. Notably, she was a very close friend of her fellow poet Nelly Sachs.
  The two exchanged letters while both in exile — Domin in Santo Domingo and Sachs
  in Sweden.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Dillon is a junior majoring in comparative literature. He loves mornings,
  is very good at sharing food, and unfortunately, can only concentrate on one thing
  at a time. He also loves languages and began his studies in Germanistik at the University
  of Freiburg before transferring to Penn. His heart is still in that sunny, charming
  university city next to Black Forest.</p>"
