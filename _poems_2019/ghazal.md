poem: |-
  نخفته‌ایم که شب بگذرد، سحر بزند                                        که آفتاب چو ققنوس، بال و پر بزند
  نخفته‌ایم که تا صبح شاعرانه‌ی ما                                           ز ره رسیده و همراه عشق، در بزند
  نسیم، بوی تو را می‌برد به همره خود                                       که با غرور، به گل های باغ سر بزند
  شب از تب تو و من سوخت، وصل‌مان آبی                                 مگر بر آتش تن‌های شعله‌ور بزند
  تمام روز که دور از تو‌ام چه خواهم کرد؟                                    هوای بستر و بالینم ار،‌ به سر بزند؟
  چو در کنار منی کفر نعمت است ای دوست!                               دو دیده‌ام مژه بر هم، دمی اگر بزند
  بپوش پنجره را، ای برهنه! می‌ترسم                                         که چشم شور ستاره، تو را، نظر بزند
  غزل برای ‌لبت عاشقانه‌تر گفتم                                             که بوسه بر دهنم عاشقانه‌تر بزند
transpoem: "We haven’t slept to see the night pass and the sky go bright\nto see the
  sun, like a phoenix, rise and take flight.\n \nWe haven’t slept to see, at daybreak,
  our poetics\ncome hand in hand, with love itself, to the door and strike.\n \nThe
  morning breeze takes your fragrance as travelmate,\nso that he can visit the roses
  in the garden beaming with pride.\n \nNight burned with our fever, our union like
  water\non the burning bodies of those set alight.\n \nWhat am I to do all day so
  far from you?\nWhat if I start thinking of our bed as it was that night?\n \nWhen
  you’re next to me, it’s the height of ungratefulness\nif my eyelashes come together,
  covering my sight.\n \nCover the window, you’re nude! and I’m afraid\nthat the evil
  eye of a star may strike you in spite.\n \nI wrote ghazals about your lips ever
  more passionately,\nso that they may kiss my lips with even more passion tonight."
note: |-
  <p>Whether motivated by certain scholarly sensibilities or a personal attachment to the centuries-old history of <em>ghazal</em>, I decided to leave the word untranslated. The <em>ghazal</em>, often translated as lyric poetry, is a poetic tradition that spans across languages and geographical boundaries. The Persian <em>ghazal</em> is defined by two sets of characteristics. First, the form, the “aa-ba-ca” rhyme scheme, is the most recognizable formal feature of the <em>ghazal</em>; there are also rules governing meter. Second, regarding the content, the <em>ghazal</em> tradition comes with a cluster of images, devices, and conventions. <em>Ghazals</em> do not have titles.</p>
  <p>As such, the translator’s challenge is also two-fold; formal qualities of the Persian <em>ghazal</em> are impossible to fully import into English. I have attempted to approximate the sound of the <em>ghazal</em> by keeping the rhyme scheme, albeit imperfectly. The conventional images are even more difficult to “translate.” The morning breeze, the rose garden, the <em>ghazal</em> itself as it is referenced in the last line, the night of separation and the morning of union that form the conceptual universe of the poem here are all common tropes within the tradition of the <em>ghazal</em>. A translation of a <em>ghazal</em> into another language — and by extension a new poetic and cultural space — divorces these images from the rich tapestry of meaning that they are a part of and that gives each of them more significance than a poem standing by itself can carry. I chose this <em>ghazal</em> to translate in part because I thought that even after the violent severance that is inevitable in the act of translation, the images retained some of their vibrancy and vitality.</p>
abio: "<p>Hossein Monzavi (d. 2003) was an Iranian poet, essayist, and translator.
  Known especially for his exceptional <em>ghazals</em>, Monzavi’s poetry has been
  regarded as a masterful amalgamation of conventional <em>ghazal</em> imagery and
  poetic innovation in the style of twentieth-century Persian free verse. His verse
  is recognizable by its effortless flow and its spiritedness. Monzavi wrote in Azeri
  Turkish, in addition to Persian. The <em>ghazal</em> here was selected from a collection
  of his poems titled <em>But You Human-in-Love, No One Understood You</em>.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Ali Noori is a doctoral student in religious studies at Penn. He likes <em>ghazals</em>.His
  dissertation is titled Pious Praise Poetry: Emotions, Piety, and the Making of Medieval
  Islamic Subject.</p>"
