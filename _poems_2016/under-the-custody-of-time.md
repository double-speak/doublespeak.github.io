title: Propiedad de la espera
transtitle: Under the Custody of Time
author: Alejandro Zambra
translator: Roberto Rodriguez
poem: "Trata de sentir el suelo\nSus pies se hunden en la arena seca\nBusca sus pies\nDetiene
  el movimiento de sus manos\nHa encontrado sus pies pero no los mira\nTodo es igual
  a como era antes\nNecesito explicar que es así,\nque todo es igual a un momento
  anterior, \ndoloroso.\nSupongo que hay mar ante sus ojos \ny que ella mira el mar\ncomo
  mira el centro de un espejo difícil."
transpoem: |-
  She tries to feel the ground
  Her feet sink on dry sand
  She looks for her feet
  She stops the movement of her hands
  She has found her feet, but she does not look at them
  Everything is as it was before
  I need to explain that it is this way,
  that everything is like a moment already lived,
  painful.
  I suppose there is an ocean in her gaze
  and that she looks at it
  the way she looks at a complex mirror.
note: "<p>“Propiedad de la espera” was exactly the poem I didn’t know I was looking
  for. Several others were tested, but this one struck me on a more personal level.
  Zambra has a subtle way of transmitting verse with intimidating simplicity, or better
  yet, decisiveness, which makes it daunting to translate when trying to stay as faithful
  to the original as possible. At first, I tried to alternate nouns when talking about
  a subject more than once, such as with “her feet.” I thought about switching between
  feet and legs in order to counter the more repetitive nature of the English, considering
  that in Spanish there is no need to directly imply a person’s gender when talking
  about him/her. “She tries,” “her feet,” “she looks,” “she stops,” and “she has”
  could not have been avoided without making the poem suffer. For example, the first
  line would translate literally into something like: “Tries to feel the floor.” The
  line uses a gender-neutral pronoun. “It” would be the closest comparison. The penultimate
  verse in the original, “Y que ella [“she”] mira el mar,” is the only indication
  of this figure’s gender. After reading the poem many times, a title instantly came
  to mind: “Under The Custody Of Time.” “Propiedad de la espera” literally translates
  to “Property Of Waiting,” which I don’t think fully grasps the poem’s meaning. To
  me, this poem is about how bittersweet it is to look back at our past, or even about
  how we sometimes feel our lives might be slipping from our hands, how we idly stand
  in place while the world just keeps turning without us. “Under The Custody Of Time</em>…</p>"
