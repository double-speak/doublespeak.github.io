author: Nâzım Hikmet
translator: Keyla Çavdar
poem: "Ben \nsenden önce ölmek isterim. \nGidenin arkasından gelen \ngideni bulacak
  mı zannediyorsun? \nBen zannetmiyorum bunu. \nİyisi mi, beni yaktırırsın, \nodanda
  ocağın üstüne korsun \niçinde bir kavanozun. \nKavanoz camdan olsun, \nşeffaf, beyaz
  camdan olsun \nki içinde beni görebilesin... \nFedakârlığımı anlıyorsun: \nvazgeçtim
  toprak olmaktan, \nvazgeçtim çiçek olmaktan \nsenin yanında kalabilmek için. \nVe
  toz oluyorum \nyaşıyorum yanında senin. \nSonra, sen de ölünce \nkavanozuma gelirsin.
  \nVe orda beraber yaşarız \nkülümün içinde külün, \nta ki bir savruk gelin \nyahut
  vefasız bir torun \nbizi ordan atana kadar... \nAma biz \no zamana kadar \no kadar
  \nkarışacağız \nki birbirimize, \natıldığımız çöplükte bile zerrelerimiz \nyan yana
  düşecek. \nToprağa beraber dalacağız. \nVe bir gün yabani bir çiçek \nbu toprak
  parçasından nemlenip filizlenirse \nsapında muhakkak \niki çiçek açacak: \nbiri
  sen \nbiri de ben. \nBen \ndaha ölümü düşünmüyorum. \nBen daha bir çocuk doğuracağım.
  \nHayat taşıyor içimden. \nKaynıyor kanım. \nYaşayacağım, ama çok, pek çok, \nama
  sen de beraber. \nAma ölüm de korkutmuyor beni. \nYalnız pek sevimsiz buluyorum
  \nbizim cenaze şeklini. \nBen ölünceye kadar da \nbu düzelir herhalde. \nHapisten
  çıkmak ihtimalin var mı bu günlerde? \nİçimden bir şey: \nbelki diyor. \n\n18 Şubat
  1945"
transpoem: "I\nwould like to die before you.\nDo you suppose the one who comes\nbehind
  will find the one who goes? \nI don’t suppose so. \nBetter, you’ll have me burned,
  \nyou’ll put me on the stove in your kitchen\ninside a pot. \nLet the pot be glass,\ntranslucent,
  white glass\nso you see me inside…\nYou see my sacrifice:\nI’ve surrendered being
  earth,\nI’ve surrendered being a flower\nto stay beside you. \nAnd I’m disappearing
  into dust\nI’m living beside you.\nThen, when you die\nyou can come to my pot.\nAnd
  we’ll live there together \nin my ashes your ashes,\nuntil a careless bride\nor
  an ungrateful grandchild \nthrows us out…\nBut we\nuntil then\nwill have so completely\nmixed\ninto
  each other, \nthat even in the dump we’re tossed in, \nour bits\nwill fall side
  by side. \nWe’ll scatter into the soil together.\nAnd if one day a wild flower \nmoistens
  and buds through this soil\nsurely in its stem\ntwo flowers will bloom:\nYou one,\nI
  the other.\nI don’t think of death yet.\nI will give birth to a child. \nLife is
  overflowing from me.\nI am full of life. \nI will live, but for a long time, very
  long,\nbut you will also live with me. \nBut death doesn’t scare me either. \nThough
  I find the manner of our funeral\nquite unpleasant.\nAnd until I die,\nthis will
  change I suppose. \nIs there a chance you’ll get out of prison \none of these days?\nSomething
  inside me\nsays maybe.\n\nFebruary 18, 1945"
note: "<p>Nâzım Hikmet has a special place in my heart that I hadn’t realized before.
  I was reintroduced to his poetry last spring through a translation class. I had
  never considered how strange it is to translate from your mother tongue, how cautious
  and intimate the experience is. There are definitely things that I find untranslatable,
  especially between Turkish and English, and Hikmet has a peculiar language of his
  own that I have not quite figured out how to define. It’s hard to let go of words
  that, to me, mean so much, and having to find those words in English can feel impossible
  from time to time. In “I Would Like to Die Before You,” I wanted to get through
  the sensation of a daydream; how images can seem so real in your head yet they also
  feel so unattainable. It’s tough to stay loyal to the original as you can say things
  in Turkish with so little words sometimes, but in English things multiply. I love
  the part about the translucent pot on the stove, and I hope I was able to bring
  that image a little closer. In the end everything still seems untranslatable, but
  I think the in-between created through translation has a life of its own, and is
  constantly moving and changing.</p>"
abio: "<p>Nâzım Hikmet (1902–1963) was a Turkish poet, playwright, and revolutionary
  figure. His political views and support for communism often landed him in jail,
  where he wrote much of his poetry. His poetry was looked to by much of Turkey’s
  youth as the poetry of the revolution. He is considered Turkey’s first modern poet
  and was influenced by the Russian Futurist movement. After being released from jail
  after starting a hunger strike, Hikmet moved to the Soviet Union.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Keyla Çavdar is a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying English
  and fine arts. She was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey, and moved to Philadelphia
  in 2014. She was reintroduced to revolutionary Turkish poet Nâzım Hikmet in Taije
  Silverman’s translation class in the spring of 2016; Hikmet’s poetry made it possible
  for her to understand not only the current political climate in Turkey, but also
  the implications of losing one’s country and language. Translation enabled her to
  dwell in the space between her mother tongue, Turkish, and her second language,
  English. Exploring the space between these languages brought about a consciousness
  of distance, which she writes about in <em>Notes on the Afterlives</em>.</p>"
