poem: |-
  我如果爱你——
  绝不像攀援的凌霄花，
  借你的高枝炫耀自己；
  我如果爱你——
  绝不学痴情的鸟儿，
  为绿荫重复单调的歌曲；
  也不止像泉源，
  常年送来清凉的慰藉；
  也不止像险峰，
  增加你的高度，衬托你的威仪。
  甚至日光，
  甚至春雨。
  不，这些都还不够！
  我必须是你近旁的一株木棉，
  作为树的形象和你站在一起。
  根，紧握在地下；
  叶，相触在云里。
  每一阵风过，
  我们都互相致意，
  但没有人，
  听懂我们的言语。
  你有你的铜枝铁干，
  像刀，像剑，也像戟；
  我有我红硕的花朵，
  像沉重的叹息，
  又像英勇的火炬。
  我们分担寒潮、风雷、霹雳；
  我们共享雾霭、流岚、虹霓。
  仿佛永远分离，
  却又终身相依。
  这才是伟大的爱情，
  坚贞就在这里：
  爱——
  不仅爱你伟岸的身躯，
  也爱你坚持的位置，
  足下的土地。
transpoem: "If I love you –\nI’ll never resemble a trumpet vine,\nborrowing your branches
  to flaunt myself;\n \nIf I love you –\nI’ll never imitate a lovebird,\nrepeating
  songs for cool shade;\n \nand more than a wellspring,\nproviding solace year-round;\nand
  more than a mountain peak,\nlifting your outlines, proclaiming your majesty;\neven
  sunlight\neven spring showers;\nno, these are not enough!\n \nI have to be a kapok
  tree by your side,\nstanding with you, vivid.\nRoots, clasp firmly underneath;\nLeaves,
  touch the clouds together.\nWith every passing gust of wind,\nwe nod to each other,\nand
  no one\ncan catch what we are saying.\n \nYou, with your copper branches and iron
  trunk\nlike knives, swords, and halberds.\nI, with my red-hot flowers\nlike heavy
  sighs,\ngallant beacons.\n \nWe share the burden of cold, thunder, and lightning.\nWe
  share the joy of fog, mist, and sun rays.\nForever seeming separate,\nyet harmonious.
  Root-bound.\n \nThis is the greatest love of all,\nfaithful throughout:\nLove –\nI
  love not only your steadfast stature,\nbut also your enduring state. \nThe land
  beneath you."
note: "<p>Shu Ting is known to be a very private individual, so her poetry is really
  the only way she expresses herself. I chose this poem because I really love the
  imagery and the challenges associated with translating such rich details. Some have
  said that this poem represents a young woman's love.</p>"
abio: <p>Born in 1952, Shu Ting (<span lang="zh">舒婷</span>)is a famous Chinese poet.
  She grew up during the Cultural Revolution, a movement that called for the destruction
  of the “Four Olds,” one of these four being culture. Forced to work in a factory,
  she rebelled against the government by writing poetry. Her reputation grew through
  poems she published from 1969 and onward in the underground journal <em>Jintian</em>
  (“Today”). Shu Ting came to be associated with what we know as “The Misty School”
  of Chinese poets, so named by the government for their obscure or “misty” qualities
  but now one the most internationally acclaimed movements in modern Chinese literature.
  She was eventually invited to join the official Chinese Writers’ Association, and
  she won the National Outstanding Poetry Award in both 1981 and in 1983.</p>
