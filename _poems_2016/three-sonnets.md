poem: "<h1>(1)</h1>\nA la stagion che ’l mondo foglia e fiora\nacresce gioia a tut[t]i
  fin’ amanti:\nvanno insieme a li giardini alora,\nche gli auscelletti fanno dolzi
  canti;\nla franca gente tutta s’inamora,\ne di servir ciascun trag[g]es’ inanti,\ned
  ogni damigella in gioia dimora;\ne me, n’abondan mar[r]imenti e pianti.\nCa lo mio
  padre m’ha messa ’n er[r]ore,\ne tenemi sovente in forte doglia:\ndonar mi vole
  a mia forza segnore,\ned io di ciò non ho disio né voglia,\ne ’n gran tormento vivo
  a tutte l’ore;\nperò non mi ralegra fior né foglia.\n\n<h1>(2)</h1>\nLasciar vor[r]ia
  lo mondo e Dio servire\ne dipartirmi d’ogne vanitate,\nperò che veg[g]io crescere
  e salire\nmat[t]ezza e villania e falsitate,\ned ancor senno e cortesia morire\ne
  lo fin pregio e tutta la bontate:\nond’io marito non vor[r]ia né sire,\nné stare
  al mondo, per mia volontate.\nMembrandomi c’ogn’om di mal s’adorna,\ndi ciaschedun
  son forte disdegnosa,\ne verso Dio la mia persona torna.\nLo padre mio mi fa stare
  pensosa,\nca di servire a Cristo mi distorna:\nnon saccio a cui mi vol dar per isposa.\n\n<h1>(3)</h1>\nOrnato
  di gran pregio e di valenza\ne risplendente di loda adornata,\nforte mi pregio più,
  poi v’è in plagenza\nd’avermi in vostro core rimembrata,\ned invitate a mia poca
  posseza\nper acontarvi, s’eo sono insegnata,\ncome voi dite, c’ag[g]io gran sapienza,\nma
  certo non ne son [tanto] amantata.\nAmantata non son como vor[r]ia \ndi gran vertute
  né di placimento;\nma, qual ch’i’ sia, ag[g]io buono volere\ndi servire con buona
  cortesia\na ciascun ch’ama sanza fallimento:\nché d’Amor sono e viogliolo ubidire."

  <h1>(1)</h1>
  The jolly pretty lovely lusty month of May
  when every heart springs buds begins to rise
  the little birds sing sweetly and completely in their Latin lingo
  and maken melodye all night with open eyes
  and every noble free frank French good person
  falls in love and strives to serve his lady
  who lives in great joy gaudia rejoicing jouissance:
  I’m miserable. I may be going crazy.
  My father’s thrown me into sin and error —
  he holds me down in torture torment terror:
  a lord and a master are his intent.
  My will and my desire won’t consent!
  I live in greater agony each day.
  Therefore I have no joy this month of May.

  <h1>(2)</h1>
  To leave the world behind is what I want:
  forsake its vanity and serve my God,
  for mad insane base villainy and falsehood
  swell rise take wing from out Pandora’s box.
  Intelligence and courtesy are dying
  and prix worth goodness generosity:
  therefore I want no master and no lord
  nor profane and urbane mundanity.
  Remembering the evil which adorns all men,
  I scorn despise abhor them in contempt
  and it’s toward God my soul self body flee.
  My father hurts wounds puts me in grave pain:
  from Christ he turns me to the world again,
  and I don’t know whose wife, whose bride, I’ll be.

  <h1>(3)</h1>
  Oh lord arrayed in prix price value valiance,
  in shining praise and worthiness adorned,
  I prize myself more worthy, since you’re pleased
  to have me in your heart, and you implore
  what little strength I have, to tell you, if I can,
  if I am Latin literate, because (you say)
  I have intelligence — but certainly I’m not
  adorned in such cloak mantle fine array.
  Mantled am I not, as I would like to be,
  in virtue or the courtier’s art of pleasing;
  whatever I may be, I have good will alway
  to serve all those in courtly courtesy
  who truly love withouten lie deceiving:
  for Love’s I am, and him I will obey.

  <p>I first encountered La Compiuta Donzella a year or two ago, when I was first learning Italian, in a historical anthology of medieval and early modern literature. As a woman translator, I have always found it convenient to assume female authorship unless otherwise specified. I made no exception while reading and rewriting the sonnets of La Compiuta Donzella. Even knowing, as a student of medieval literature, that medieval poets and writers tend toward self-camouflage rather than self-revelation, I persisted in reading her poems autobiographically — or semi-autobiographically, at least.</p>
  <p>My translations of La Compiuta Donzella’s sonnets do not follow a literal phrase-by-phrase procedure, nor are they conventionally literary verse renderings. Instead, inspired by Caroline Bergvall’s Chaucerian re-visions in <em>Meddle English</em>, I opted for a sort of poetic archaeology, digging up buried idioms and lost meanings that were once common to the English and Italian vernaculars. At a practical level, this has entailed amplifying key words and abbreviating various others, as well as a certain amount of free association. I hope that parts of these translations will sound familiar to readers of Chaucer’s <em>Canterbury Tales</em>, Malory’s <em>Morte d’Arthur</em>, and anonymous early modern English and Scottish balladry.</p>
  <p>The versions of the original texts reproduced here are drawn from Gianfranco Contini’s anthology <em>Poeti del Duecento: Poesia cortese toscana e settentrionale</em> (1960).</p>
abio: "<p>If she truly existed, (La) Compiuta Donzella was a thirteenth-century Italian
  poet who was the first woman to have written poetry in the Italian vernacular. However,
  some theorize that the poet was simply a creation of male poets, as there are no
  records of her existence other than her three sonnets. In this piece, she writes
  about her life and how she was torn between becoming a nun and succumbing to her
  father’s wishes to marry a man her father had chosen for her.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Samantha Pious is a graduate student in comparative literature and literary
  theory at the University of Pennsylvania. Her first book, <em>A Crown of Violets</em>
  (Headmistress Press, 2015), offers a selection of the French poetry of Renée Vivien
  in English translation. Some of her other translations and poems have appeared or
  are forthcoming in the <em>Berkeley Poetry Review</em>, <em>Mezzo Cammin</em>, <em>Queen
  Mob’s Teahouse</em>, and other publications.</p>"
