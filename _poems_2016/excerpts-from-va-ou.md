transtitle: Excerpts from <em>Va où</em>
author: Valérie Rezeau
translator: Malika Kadyrova
poem: "Quand je passerai je voudrais \nbien avoir de ma vie fait mon tour\nAimé aimé
  gratuitement passionnément \net pas du tout aimé sans fin jusques au bout\nEt encore
  maintenant toujours\nPour quand je m’en irai dormir \ncomme il faut je rêve tous
  les rêves\nJ’envisage toutes les figures qu’elles \nrient rondes ou carrées ou pleuvent\n\n~\n\nJe
  me défends parce \nque je ne suis pas dure\nJe me défends pour toi \nmoi nous vous
  ils\nTout ce qui tire sur ma \ncorde sensible pour me secouer\nJ’ai fait la liste
  des choses \nà oublier nous ne manquerons de rien\nLes cloches pourront sonner \nau
  cou de la vie vache nous \naurons le vin fou nous aurons le temps gai"
transpoem: "When I go I’d like to have \nhad my turn at my life\nLoved to have loved
  freely passionately and not at all \nto have loved endlessly to the end\nAnd still
  holding forever\nSince when I leave to go to bed as \nI should I dream all the dreams\nI
  picture all the faces they’re laughing \nround square or raining\n\n~\n\nI fight
  back because I am not tough\nI fight back for you me us you they\nEverything that
  pushes pulls on my heartstrings \nto undo me\nI’ve made a list of things \nto forget
  we’ll want for nothing\nThe bells can ring on this dog’s life \nwe’ll have our fool’s
  wine we’ll have a good time"
note: |-
  <p>I have chosen particularly short excerpts here; these five-line extracts are tiny roller-coasters, especially considering Rouzeau’s tendency to forgo punctuation in order to create overlapping phrases within phrases. An interesting moment for me was in grappling with Rouzeau’s bells that could “sonner au cou de la vie vache.”  I had initially seen the bells as ringing “until the cows come home,” although that didn’t fully encompass the misery of <em>la vie vache</em>, which then became “a dog’s life.”</p>
  <p><em>Va où</em> is a sprawling collection, and I am slowly translating and retranslating my way through it. I find that the poems hit me at a different angle every time and I find myself grasping them at different ends, which accounts for my sense of the <em>maintenant</em> in “encore maintenant toujours” as being closer – for me – to “holding” than “now.”</p>
abio: "<p>Valérie Rouzeau (1967–) is a French poet and translator. In 2012 she won
  the Prix Apollinaire for her collection <em>Vrouz</em>. Rouzeau’s poetry is adventurous
  and passionate; she works with neologisms, puns, and incorporates baby-talk in a
  fascinating blend of the adult poet’s and the little girl’s voices. Her language
  comes alive in a powerful stretch that engulfs the reader in the emotion conveyed.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Malika Kadyrova graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2015 with
  a major in comparative literature and minors in French and classical studies. She’s
  currently at Moscow State Institute of International Relations, wandering along
  the postgrad brick road in the direction of a career in simultaneous interpretation.</p>"
