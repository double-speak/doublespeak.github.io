transpoem: "Adaptation of <em>Parzival</em> Book III\n\nThe day you shot your first
  bird dead,\nthe sound of its song grew.\nIt started out a whistle, whispering through\nleaves
  caught by your arrow’s test,\nbut then it rose into your breast\nand ripped a hole
  between\nwhat you had understood to mean\nour world removed from history\nand you,
  or where you should be.\nThe birdsong hardened to a stone\nand found a place among
  your bones\nto nest and bite with each new shot\nat feathered wings until a spot\nof
  brilliant red on trampled green\n— a side of death you’d never seen —\nwas just
  enough to newly tear\nthat hole between small lungs and air.\nYou ran to me with
  tear-stained eyes,\na child unable to say why\nthe silence of a bird’s sweet song\nhad
  opened your heart to a world of wrong.\n \nOne day I saw you rent your hair\n— my
  child who had never a care —\nand watching how the magpie drew\ninto your chest,
  I quickly knew\nthe birds that day would have to die\nto keep your thoughts turned
  from the sky.\nThe curse of blood, your father’s art,\nhad somehow found your weakest
  part.\nMy darling son, I pulled you near,\nand leaves like lips unfolded fear.\nI
  ordered men to find and snatch\nfrom trees all birds that they could catch,\nbut
  of those birds remained a few\nwhose whistles brought that curse anew.\nThe touch
  of roses on your skin\nhad faded to a dew so thin,\nAs each bird’s death became
  a fief,\nyou asked: “What have birds done for strife?”\n \nI kissed you on the mouth
  and said:\n“It’s not through me that birds fall dead,\nbut surely through the highest
  god.\nHow could I walk where he has trod?”\nThat small word pulled your chest abroad:\n“Ôwe,
  Mother, what is god?”\n“Sweet Parzival, I truly say,\nthat god is lighter than the
  day,\nhis countenance made to reflect\nthe good in man you would expect.\nFor you
  may turn in times of need\nto he whose greatest loyalty\nextends to all found in
  distress,\nso long as faith is not suppressed.\nThere roams another — lord of hell
  —\nwhose loyalty in darkness fell.\nAway from him turn all your thoughts,\nespecially
  when they are caught\nin blinding doubt’s inconstancies.”\n \nRemember how we lived
  at ease."
note: "<p>Completed around 1210 and now regarded as one of the great German epics
  of its time, <em>Parzival</em> was introduced to a German audience that had already
  read about Arthurian romance and chivalry. But Parzival is a somewhat alternative
  knight. This translation is roughly a third of a longer, researched piece that I
  adapted from Book III of <em>Parzival</em>. My research drew from the conversation
  between Parzival and his mother, Herzeloyde, which introduces von Eschenbach’s interest
  in Parzival’s humanity and the place of religion in his story, both of which set
  <em>Parzival</em> apart from the standard courtly ideals and characters of Arthuriana.
  Throughout the narrative, Parzival returns to his childhood questions about his
  own relationship both to God and the rest of humanity. Upon her husband Gahmuret’s
  death in battle, Herzeloyde decides to move with Parzival and their servants to
  the forest, in order to shield Parzival from knighthood; no one is allowed to speak
  the word “knight” or mention King Arthur. My translation is written in von Eschenbach’s
  style of rhyming couplets, but I chose to adapt this section from a third-person
  narrative to Herzeloyde’s first person perspective as a way of exploring the character
  transformations of both Herzeloyde and Parzival. I took license with the reordering
  of translated lines and emphasis on certain narrative aspects as a means of staying
  true to the new Herzeloyde perspective.</p>"
abio: "<p>All that we know of Wolfram von Eschenbach (1160/80–1220) comes from his
  poetry. While there are no extant historical documents that mention Wolfram, he
  does refer to himself in his work as a knight, a poet with many patrons, and even
  an illiterate writer. Based on the dialects of his written works and their geographical
  references, present-day Bavaria has been designated as Wolfram’s birthplace. Wolfram
  composed the narrative works <em>Parzival</em>, <em>Titurel</em>, and <em>Willehalm</em>,
  in addition to lyric poetry.</p>"
