transtitle: Sleeping on a Night of Autumn
author: Bai Juyi
translator: Jasmine Phun
poem: |-
  秋雨夜眠
  晾冷三秋夜
  安闲一老翁
  卧迟灯灭后
  睡美雨声中
  灰宿温瓶火
  香添暖被笼
  晓晴寒未起
  霜叶满阶红
transpoem: |-
  Rain falls during a late Autumn night,
  an old man calmly approaches the inviting bed.
  The light is extinguished.

  Rain falls pitter-patter on the window,
  the crackling fire soothes his wrinkled skin,
  the smell of ashes dissipates into the cool air,
  the snug blanket envelopes his frail body.

  Dawn arrives.
  He does not rise.
  Frost piles on the autumn leaves.
note: "<p>Bai Juyi is one of the most famous Tang poets in Chinese history. Like much
  famous classical Chinese poetry, his works are concise yet powerful in evoking feeling
  and expression due to his careful choice of words. This poem in particular stood
  out to me for Bai’s effort to show a different perspective on death. Although initially
  depressing, his careful choice of words throughout the poem complicate and expand
  its mood. I was struck by the sense of beauty he gives to the depressing concept
  of death. In an effort to maintain his concise writing style, I chose short and
  simple phrases with careful, spare words.</p>"
abio: <p>Bai Juyi (<span lang="zh">白居易</span>) is one of the most famous Chinese poets
  of all time. He lived from 772 to 846. A government official who rose to fame during
  the Tang Dynasty, he is known for his straightforward writing style, which makes
  his poetry popular not only with the native Chinese but also with others outside
  China, particularly in Japan. His poetry often addresses government corruption and
  militarism.</p>
tbio: "<p>Jasmine Phun is a pre-med student at Penn with a special interest in learning
  languages. Beyond a heavy load of science classes, she has taken Korean and Chinese
  for at least four semesters and continues to study Chinese. Although she has been
  learning Chinese since freshman year of high school, this is her first translation
  of Chinese literature. It has been refreshing for her to be exposed to a different
  side of China, as her studies of the language are usually dominated by the country’s
  political and economic influence in the world.</p>"
