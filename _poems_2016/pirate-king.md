poem: "Ou temps qu’Alixandre regna,\nUng homs nommé Diomedès\nDevant luy on l’amena,\nEngrillonné
  poulces et des\nComme ung larron, car il fut des\nEscumeurs que voions courir;\nSi
  fut mis devant ce cadès, \nPour estre jugié a mourir.\n\nL’empereur si l’araisonna
  :\n« Pourquoi es tu larron en mer? »\nL’autre response luy donna:\n« Pourquoi larron
  me faiz nommer?\nPour ce qu’on me voit escumer\nEn une petiote fuste?\nSe comme
  toy me peusse armer,\nComme toy empereur je fusse.\n\n« Mais que veux-tu? De ma
  fortune,\nContre qui ne puis bonnement,\nQui si faulcement me fortune,\nMe vient
  tout ce gouvernement.\nExcuse moy aucunement\nEt saiche qu’en grant povreté\n(Ce
  mot se dit communement),\nNe gist pas grande loyauté. »\n\nQuant l’empereur ot remiré\nDe
  Diomedès tout le dit :\n« Ta fortune je te mueray\nMauvaise en bonne », si luy dit.\nSi
  fist il. Onc puis ne mesdit\nA personne, mais fut vray homme;\nValere pour vray
  le baudit,\nQui fut nommé le Grant a Rome."
transpoem: "During Alexander’s reign,\nthe man they called Diomedes\nwas brought before
  him, all in chains,\nfrom toes to fingers, as a thief,\nfor he was of the outlaw
  band\nwhose raids we’ve seen go sailing by.\nBefore the captain he was brought\nto
  be condemned to die.\n\nThe emperor approached him: “Why\nare you a pirate on the
  sea?”\nThe other gave him this reply:\n“Why do you call it piracy?\nBecause we skim
  along the coast,\nmy little sailboat and my crew?\nHad I a navy armed like yours,\nthen
  I were emperor like you.\n\n“But what do you care? Lady Luck,\nagainst whom no good
  ship can steer,\nshe’s luffed me over in this muck!\nHer government has brought
  me here. \nExcuse my French, since you must know\nthat men in desperate poverty\n—
  these words are in the Pirates’ Code —\nwe can’t afford great loyalty.”\n\nBut when
  the emperor had heard\nDiomedes, why then, instead —\n“I’ll change your luck from
  bad to good,”\nthe leader said. And so he did.\nHe never spoke an evil word,\nmore
  faithful man was never known,\nand (from Valerius) we learn\nthat he was named the
  Great in Rome. "
note: "<p>In these verses, the fabled confrontation between the pirate captain Diomedes
  and the legendary emperor Alexander the Great attests to a basic equivalence between
  government and criminal, tyrant and terrorist, revolutionary and traitor. The last
  line of the third stanza is of course sardonic, and the syntactic slippage between
  Alexander and Diomedes in the final stanza is deliberate. The title “Pirate King”
  may refer to Diomedes, Alexander, or both at once.</p>"

  <p>François Villon (1431–1463?), poet, student, and outlaw, composed the translated verses in prison as part of his <em>Testament</em>, a poetic riff on the legal convention of a last will. Born into poverty, he was adopted and raised by a chaplain and future professor of canon law at the University of Paris, where he would receive a bachelor’s degree in 1449 and a master’s in 1452.</p>
  <p>Villon’s first run-in with the law occurred in 1455, when he was arrested for assaulting a priest in a brawl; the following year, he helped to orchestrate the theft of five hundred gold crowns from the College of Navarre. His first major work, <em>Le lais</em> (<em>The Legacy</em>), a poetic last will that prefigures the longer <em>Testament</em>, dates from around the time of this robbery. Over the next few years, during his first exile from Paris, he may have found a literary patron and legal protector in Duke Charles of Orléans, whose personal album contains three of Villon’s shorter poems.</p>
  <p>During the summer of 1461, Villon was imprisoned once again, this time at Meung-sur-Loire, where he composed the <em>Testament</em> before being liberated, along with many other prisoners, as part of a display of royal munificence by King Louis XI on his travels through the provinces. Villon’s final arrest occurred in Paris, in 1462. Condemned to hang, he appealed and was granted a commuted sentence of ten years’ banishment from the city. After January 1463, no further trace of him remained.</p>
