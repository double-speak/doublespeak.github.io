  “Dah ziādư āsan bajēmưts”

             “Teli hē rạ̄ti rātas ōs gāś vuzvun āsān!
  Dazvunuy āsān!”​

  “Voni kath pẙṭh chakh vōlān?”

  “Vāhi teli ạ̄si dapān anigoṭ mā nẙnglāvi
  Tư voni chu gāś pazī khẙni yivān.”

  “Put out the light”

                 “What are you sitting on?”

  “It must be past ten o’clock”

                 “Then oh! all night the light kept burning.
  Kept on burning.”

  “Now what are you getting enraged about?”

  “Alas, then it used to be said that the darkness might swallow —
  and now the light truly comes to devour.”
