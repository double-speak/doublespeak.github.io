  Kot gatshan bēcāru’ bēgar rāh musāfir kot gatshan
  Vānu’ penjan pẙṭh vọthān tim vūri vūri rạ̄tirātas

  Natu’ zacal khū’man andar

  Chus divān lari phirni kun zon jānvār
  Kamli tal yath zạdi tu’vuli

transpoem: "Since last evening, \nwhat a devious, threatening night\nThe last, darkest
  hour of the night\n\nWe had kept consecrated and orderly \nthe universe\nTrembling
  the blessed land, \nits consciousness lost\n\nDisappeared the starry sky, \nnowhere
  the Milky Way\nDark clouds have enveloped and busied \nall the six directions\n\nThe
  pythons’ mouths are open\nIn hailstorms, though sheets of rain, \nin the thunderstorm\n\nWhere
  will the poor and unhoused wayfarers go, \nwhere will they go\nFrom the thresholds
  of the shops, \nthey leave for faraway places all night\n​\nOr inside ragged tents\nIn
  tree-holds, shrinking, birds doze\n\nI toss-and-turn, a lone bird\nOnce under the
  blanket, torn and holey\n\nIn a corner of the tent, my pillow a brick\nWhen will
  the light dawn, when the bulbul sing\n\nThe hailstorm seems to rain stones\nBeware,
  let no one leave the house​\n\nI am waiting\nWhen will the temple bell sound\n\nFrom
  the mosque, the muezzin will call\nGod is Great, Allah-o-Akbar, ears will hear\n\nAt
  dawn, the sun prepares\nPulls on the chariot’s reins\n\nJust about now, a soft light
  will spread\nThe dark clouds will be scattered, will flee\n\nThe waves of the Wular
  have slept badly \nlong enough\nNow they will settle quietly, calmly, peacefully\n\nNow
  they will bloom, \nthe hill tops will wear bright garlands\nLightning’s edge will
  disappear in \nthe Apharwat hills*\n\nScurrying again, \nbanks of clouds will dissipate\nLimbs
  broken, \nthey will turn cotton puffs over \nthe Zabarwan hills**\n\n*The Gulmarg
  hills\n**The Srinagar hills"
