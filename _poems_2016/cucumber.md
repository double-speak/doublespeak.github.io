poem: "Avluda diz boyu kar\nlapa lapa da yağıyor\nhızını alamadı sabahtan beri bir
  türlü.\nMutfaktayız.\nMasada, muşambanın üstünde bahar\nMasada, muşambanın üstünde
  körpecik \nbir salatalık\nçiçeği burnunda, pütürlü.\nÇepçevre oturmuş bakıyoruz
  ona\nşavkı vuruyor yüzümüze yumuşacık\nbir tazeliktir kokuyor bir tazelik.\nÇepçevre
  oturmuş bakıyoruz ona\nşaşkın,\ndüşünceli,\niyimser.\nRüyada gibi bir halimiz var.\n\nMasada,
  muşambanın üstünde umut\nMasada, muşambanın üstünde güzel günler\nyeşil bir güneşle
  yüklü bir bulut\nyaklaşan sabırsız zümrüt bir kalabalık\naçılıp saçılacak sevdalar\nmasada,
  muşambanın üstünde körpecik \nbir salatalık\nçiçeği burnunda, pütürlü.\n\nAvluda
  diz boyu kar\nlapa lapa da yağıyor\nhızını alamadı sabahtan beri bir türlü.\n\nNâzım
  Hikmet\nMart 1960, Moskova"
transpoem: "In the yard, snow sits tall\nand still, flake after flake falls\nsince
  morning, unfulfilled.\nWe’re in the kitchen.\nOn the table, atop the cloth, spring
  —\non the table, atop the cloth, a tender little cuke,\nwith bumpy husk and blossomed
  stalk. \nWe surround it, staring.\nIts cool glow soothes our faces\nwith a satin
  sweep.\nHow fresh its scent, how fresh —\nWe surround it, staring —\nbaffled\npensive\nlight\nas
  if we’re in a dream.\nOn the table, atop the cloth, hope —\non the table, atop the
  cloth, mended pep,\na cloud set to spill\na sprouting sun,\nseas of eager seeds\nnearby,\nblooming
  loves uncovered.\nOn the table, atop the cloth, a tender little cuke,\nwith bumpy
  husk and blossomed stalk. \nIn the yard, snow sits tall\nand still flake after flake
  falls\nsince morning, unfulfilled.\n\nMoscow, March 1960\n"
note: "<p>Due to what some might call an unusual affinity towards cucumbers, I was
  immediately drawn to this poem by Nâzım Hikmet. While it was the title that initially
  caught my attention, it was Hikmet’s descriptions and language (and the feelings
  they evoked) that drew me to translate the poem. The first line of “Cucumber” talks
  about the snow outside piling up, despite it being the start of spring. In a conspicuously
  similar manner, while I was reading the poem one April morning in Philadelphia,
  it began to snow outside of the library! Through my translation, I sought to replicate
  the essence of sincere (but slightly irrational) hope — for spring, for a fresh
  start, for change — as present in Hikmet’s words today as it was years ago.</p>"
abio: "<p>Nâzım Hikmet (1902-1963) was a Turkish poet, playwright, and revolutionary
  figure. His political views and support for communism often landed him in jail,
  where he wrote much of his poetry. His poetry was looked to by much of Turkey’s
  youth as the poetry of the revolution. He is considered Turkey's first modern poet
  and was influenced by the Russian Futurist movement. Finally released from jail
  after starting a hunger strike (which was then joined by international figures),
  Hikmet moved to the Soviet Union, where he was very well-received.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Monica Wojciechowski grew up in Denville, NJ, but considers Poland to be
  her second home. She spent this past summer traveling through Eastern and Central
  Europe, and she stayed with family in Poland’s countryside, harvesting fruit, taking
  long walks, picking mushrooms, and translating poetry. Nothing makes Monica happier
  than sharing her heritage with others; whether through stories, food, music, or
  language, she is always grateful for the opportunity to do so. It was not until
  recently that Monica discovered the captivating world of literary translation, but
  now that she has, she doesn’t plan on leaving it anytime soon.</p>"
