transtitle: By the Água Grande
author: Alda do Espírito Santo
translator: Marisa Bruno
poem: "Lá no Água Grande\nLá no «Água Grande» \na caminho da roça negritas batem que
  batem co’a roupa na pedra. \nBatem e cantam modinhas da terra.\nCantam e riem em
  riso de mofa histórias contadas, \narrastadas pelo vento.\nRiem alto de rijo, com
  a roupa na pedra \ne pōem de branco a roupa lavada.\nAs crianças brincam e a água
  canta. \nBrincam na água felizes… \nVelam no capim um negrito pequenino.\nE os gemidos
  cantados das negritas \nlá do rio ficam mudos lá na hora do regresso… \nJazem quedos
  no regresso para a roça."
transpoem: "By the Água Grande*\nBound for the fields, by Água Grande, \nBlack women
  beat and beat cloth against stone. \nThey beat and sing songs of their home.\nThey
  sing and laugh laughs full of scorn, \nTell stories… tossed into wind.\nStrongly
  they laugh, keeping cloth against stone, \nTurning to white the cloth that they
  clean.\nThe children play! And the waters sing! \nThe children in gay waters play…\nKeeping
  baby black boy in the reeds.\n…\nThe cries that the black women by the river sing
  \nGo quiet at the hour of return… Fall still returning to the fields.\n\n*The Água
  Grande River runs through São Tomé’s most populated province, \nwhich is also called
  Água Grande."
note: "<p>I have made what feel like thousands of attempts to properly translate Alda
  do Espírito Santo’s “Lá no Água Grande,” and have failed in each of them. But, here,
  I submit one such attempt for publication in the hopes that my translation can help
  shed light on this important poet.</p>"

  <p>As both writer and government leader, Alda do Espírito Santo played an essential role in São Tomé and Príncipe’s transition to independence from Portugal. She writes as a woman, to women, and for women, presenting her readers with images of strong women who have the power to liberate the islands from Portuguese colonial oppression. Despite her privileged upbringing, she dedicates her words to the working-class women of the islands who carried, both figuratively and literally, the future of the islands on their backs. The women she describes in poems like “By the Água Grande” are mothers, workers, and, most importantly, fighters.</p>
  <p>Alda Espírito Santo’s poetry, which so lauded the islands’ women, celebrated and nourished a culture that relied on the power and strength of women. It points to the many ways in which women poets in Africa have played—and still play—an important role as agents for change in the liberated Portuguese colonies. Despite her influence in São Tomé, her poetry, like that of most Lusophone African (and especially women) writers, has been relegated to the periphery of post-colonial studies.</p>
tbio: "<p>Marisa Bruno wrote her senior thesis on Alda do Espírito Santo, hoping to
  bring some attention to two marginalized categories of Lusophone (Portuguese-language)
  writers: African Lusophone writers and female Lusophone writers. She was a Portuguese
  target in the Huntsman Program and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania
  in May 2016.</p>"
