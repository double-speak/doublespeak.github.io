note: "<p>I don’t like talking about origins because I don’t know where anything comes
  from, at least anything that is not matter. When I am listening, or walking, or
  talking to someone, I pick out their words and I save them. Sometimes these are
  words from my mother tongue, the language I heard before all else. Sometimes these
  are words I could not locate in that tongue but found first in English or French.
  A notebook full of written words I want to say: “seeps,” “salt,” “mulberry.” And
  the words I extend into other languages from Turkish: <em>susuz</em>: “without water.”
  <em>Rüya</em>: “dream.” <em>Uzaklık</em>: “distance.” My <em>uzaklık</em> belongs
  to a simple intention. “A’dan b’ye olan uzaklan”: “the distance from point A to
  point B.” From Istanbul to Philadelphia, two flights: 9,649 kilometers. From Istanbul
  to Moscow, where the poet Nâzım Hikmet fled to exile after decades in prison: 1,753
  kilometers. He would die there after writing “Things I Didn’t Know I Loved.” The
  sun I have loved it seems, even as it sets, covered in sour cherry marmalade. With
  Hikmet my <em>uzaklık</em> reappeared. Changing, unstable, the word “distance” multiplies
  and scatters. It’s a physical space, and it’s inside the mind. And it’s between
  hearts. There’s a deadly distance.</p>\n\n<em><pre style=\"text-indent: 10px\">13
  Kasım 1945\n\nKara haberler geliyor uzaktaki şehrimden:\nnamuslu, çalışkan, fakir

  distanced city:\nthe city of honest laborers, of poor people —\nmy genuine Istanbul,\nmy
  love, that city which is your place\nso wherever I am driven out to, whichever prison
  I am in,\non my back, in the sack I carry\nand like pain for a lost child in my
  heart,\nthe city I keep, in my eyes, like a dream of you…</em></pre>\n\n<p>All these
  things I have loved all this time, it seems, and yet never knew. I had not known
  Nâzım the prisoner. Nâzım the lover. Only a name, Nâzım Hikmet, one of our poets,
  here in Istanbul. He had slipped away between so many other words; to whom those
  other words belonged I could never remember. My city, where I was born and raised,
  where my mother and father were born and raised, where I lived for seventeen years,
  fourteen years at the same school with the same seventy people. A stranger in a
  strange place there, yet I still don’t belong anywhere else. My city, eight thousand
  kilometers away from me, at five thousand miles’ distance; I’m sitting in class
  and a teacher — a stranger — writes Atatürk on the board. We’re talking about Turkey
  in the twentieth century as I set up my presentation on Hikmet. None of the students
  know who he is. We had just met too, in a way, Nazım and I. Two strangers, now side
  by side. Hikmet was sentenced to twenty-eight years in prison in 1938. After twelve
  of them he was exiled, his nationality revoked. He went to Russia, but his lover
  was left behind. Piraye, the lover I know from his “9pm–10pm” poems, which he wrote
  each night in prison before lights out. Hikmet, one of many who were silenced, but
  one of few who managed to scream. I share the scream, share my <em>uzaklık</em>
  with the class. His <em>uzaklık</em>.</p>\n\n<p>“Just as the manifestations of life
  are intimately connected with the phenomenon of life without being of importance
  to it, a translation issues from the original – not so much from its life as from
  its afterlife.” – Walter Benjamin, “The Task of the Translator.”</p>\n\n<p>It’s
  strange to encounter his afterlife, Hikmet in translation.</p>\n\n<p>“All purposeful
  manifestations of life, including their very purposiveness, in the final analysis
  have their end not in life, but in the expression of its nature, in the representation
  of its significance […] Languages are not strangers to one another, but are, a priori
  and apart from all historical relationships, interrelated in what they want to express.”
  Reading Benjamin, I think about how Hikmet’s resistance to silence echoes through
  Turkey now, his manifestation of life so clear and insistent that I can hear him
  singing in the prison cell even before I learn that he was locked away. His afterlife
  survives, traveling from one language to another, bringing him closer to me.</p>\n\n<p>In
  a video that his last love, Vera, made, I see him dancing in Moscow, spinning round
  and around on the grass, near the end of his life.</p>\n\n<p>I silently read his
  poem, “On Living,” in English:</p>\n\n<em><pre style=\"text-indent: 10px\">Living
  is no laughing matter:\nYou must live with great seriousness\nlike a squirrel.</pre>\n\n<p>My
  mother taught me to live <em>sincap gibi</em> (“like a squirrel”), to take life
  lightly but to live seriously, amorously, <em>sımsıkı tutunarak</em> (“holding on
  tightly”). I remembered, from the echo of the original, Hikmet’s words that were
  with me at a distance. They multiply. I multiply. Questions multiply. The students
  around me ask, “Who is Atatürk?” They don’t know the face that hangs next to the
  clock in every classroom of my childhood. Every Monday morning, every Friday before
  class is dismissed, the face projected upon the Turkish flag as we sing the national
  anthem. Atatürk, and with him, fake nostalgia. I am afraid to speak of him now,
  of this man or god, but I know the minds of the students around me are untouched,
  that Atatürk is just a name. So I speak despite the fear. I tell them of how poisonously
  my people cling to him, transformed him into a euphemism for fascism. I try to explain
  how thoughtlessly we praise the past and think that it can resurrect in the present.
  What a narcissistic view of history, textbooks full of instruction without vitality.</p>\n\n<p>What
  I don’t say to my class is that it was against this void that I began searching.
  Like a survival instinct, a defense: What I believed my language obscured, or didn’t
  allow me to know, I tried to find in English. And English was trying to find something
  in me. Already in the twentieth century as the modern Turkish alphabet left behind
  an Arabic script, English was being taught as a second language in schools. It had
  already invaded who I was going to be, before I was born. A problem of unwritten
  genealogy. (“Genealogy.” A word Nietzsche taught me in a class during my freshman
  year. It was in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> that I encountered it first, a way
  to describe the relationship of things to one another. A string of points in history,
  points in time, their distance from one another connected by a motive. <em>Uzaklık</em>.
  Distance.)</p>\n\n<p>In my Istanbul classrooms, yesterday and today were always
  forgotten. History would not be found in poetry, in individuals, in honest words.
  So the history of my birthplace became what I could glean from my mother’s childhood.
  She grew up in the seventies, and she’d play on the streets for hours with her brother
  and his friends. I look at a black-and-white photograph of my mother and my uncle,
  neither older than ten and with the same boyish haircut. They’re running in a field
  with a ball. I never played on the streets of my neighborhood, or threw a ball to
  kids there.</p>\n\n<p>Someone in the class asks me about the present. The nostalgia
  is blinding, vicious; the fields are gone, and there are no children. I suddenly
  remember the little boy who died when I was in high school, in between the sadness
  of forgetting him. Only five, he goes out to get bread for his family. A tear gas
  canister takes his life. Only two years ago. I tell the students sitting around
  me about the Gezi Park protests, which started when the government decided to demolish
  Gezi Park, one of the few remaining green spaces in Istanbul; the Prime Minister’s
  plans included the construction of a shopping mall, a mosque, and Ottoman Empire
  replicas in its place. A community started to gather in the park, made up of people
  from all over Istanbul; some even stayed in tents overnight. They wrote, and they
  sang, and they shared with each other. But words are dangerous. The demonstrations
  were broken up when the police arrived; they used water cannons and tear gas, beat
  the protestors and burned their tents. Many lost their lives. <em>Vatan hainleri</em>
  (“Traitors of the nation”). Journalists and poets, kids, college students, people
  passing by, a boy buying bread. I learned what was going on through friends and
  family. All social media was blocked. All communication forbidden. News channels
  went black. A terrifying darkness. A darkness that was already everywhere, but one
  I hadn’t seen, one I was distanced from. The point from A to B. An intention. Hikmet’s
  exile had entered into those dying on the streets. An afterlife. Yet how can it
  be so dangerous to write? I wanted to tell the students sitting around me and watching,
  puzzled, how with Hikmet’s poetry began a yearning for the language that thought
  me. The language of my first signs. A drive to uncover fragments, doubles, associations
  and so, to recover the skin that was peeled off:</p>\n\n<em><pre style=\"text-indent:
  10px\">i am a kid\nand the skin of a peach\nfuzzy and foreign\nis too strange on
  my tongue.\nimpatient\ni skin the peach</em></pre>\n\n<p>“But you don’t sound Turkish,”
  say countless voices.</p>\n\n<p>What is a skinless peach? What is it to sound Turkish,
  or to look Turkish, or to feel Turkish? Is it the <em>r</em> that rolls too strongly,
  the <em>t</em> that is a touch sharper, the <em>o</em> that is not round enough?
  <em>Hatirlamak</em>, “to remember,” its <em>t</em> carves itself on the tongue and
  then immediately pours into that rolling <em>r</em> — they hiss together as they’re
  lost into the <em>l</em> and solidified with that final <em>k</em>. <em>Mor</em>,
  “purple,” its <em>o</em> like a ring of smoke, slightly imperfect, how it sounds
  like an impatient “more.” I miss my voice, so I get lost thinking of it. The violets
  in my garden are riddled with circles where caterpillars have bitten through; an
  image of these violets comes to mind. What is it inside of me upon which English
  intrudes? And how. In the garden, next to the violets, my father is sitting in his
  green chair. Legs crossed. <em>Yaz kokuyor</em>: “it smells like summer.” His beloved
  season, my father, a boy in the sun. He plays “My Heart Belongs to Daddy” for me,
  and sings along with Eartha Kitt. We dance on the grass, my hand the size of his
  thumb. Innocence, like honey melting in warm milk. Which is how English seeped into
  my thoughts. I am drinking warm milk with honey, enveloped in my mother’s bed as
  she reads <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em> in English. My uncle lived in Los Angeles
  at the time, and he would bring us suitcases filled with books. Shel Silverstein’s
  <em>Falling Up</em> and <em>The Giving Tree</em>, <em>The Miraculous Journey of
  Edward Tulane</em> by Kate DiCamillo, <em>James and the Giant Peach</em>, and <em>The
  Little Prince</em>. I would insist that my mother read to me about the Wild Things,
  and how Max would tame them with the words “Be still,” and how their hearts were
  as soft as their fur, and the look in their eyes. One night I sat up straight in
  bed while still asleep, turned, and pointed toward my mother, saying: “Be still!”
  Do I dream in and with language, then? Was I even dreaming? I don’t remember. In
  all of us I think there is this urge to say certain things, to speak certain words.
  And we carry them with us, like ants swarming in and around our body, little particles
  waiting to escape. Maybe when our guards are down, they speak with us.</p>  \n\n<p>I
  came across an interview of Eartha Kitt once, not too long ago. She’s been asked,
  “Isn’t love a union between two people? Or does Eartha fall in love with herself?”
  Eartha lets out that divine laugh, long, devilish, and sublime: “Yes. I fall in
  love with myself, and I want someone to share it with me. I want someone to share
  me with me.” To want to know someone, or something, completely — not for just one
  moment in time but for all the moments preceding. To let them be themselves, and
  to love only that. And how can such a want manifest in translation? I watch Eartha
  as she sits against a backdrop of pink flowers, the same ones my grandmother loved;
  her gaze meets mine for an instance as she speaks. I feel in awe as I sense her
  strength, her sensitivity, her respect for herself. Eartha Kitt, one of many who
  exist as a fragment of me. Eartha, carved in my memory. She slips back into existence
  from time to time, somehow knowing when to reappear. I’m sitting on the carpet floor
  of my apartment in Philadelphia. It’s nighttime and my living room is illuminated
  by broken string lights. I’m tired and all I want to do is lie on the floor. I put
  on <em>The Best of Eartha Kitt</em>. “Après Moi” begins to play with a crackle.
  We’ve been friends for a long long time, we’ve shared again and again; we like the
  same clothes and we like the same wine. I get up to make coffee, and gather my books
  to work. The record continues now, and I don’t notice the passing songs. My guard
  is down. Unfamiliar words with familiar sounds capture me through the recorded songs.
  “Üşküdar'a gider iken…” She’s singing “On the way to Üsküdar,” but in Turkish, and
  with the most charming of errors; she utters my beloved <em>ş</em> instead of <em>s</em>.
  How is it I’ve never noticed, the countless times I’ve played this album? It’s a
  subtle difference, but you can feel it inside of your cheeks, a puff of warm wind.
  <em>Ş</em>, pronounced “sh.” I sit and listen to this Turkish ballad we learned
  in music class when I was eleven years old. Now I’m nineteen and she speaks to me,
  sings my country’s tale of a nineteenth-century woman in love with her much younger
  clerk. He is hers, and she, his. “Kâtibimi arar iken yanımda buldum” … “As I was
  looking for him, I found him beside me.”</p>\n\n<p>I am Max. Sitting on my white
  carpet in my living room in West Philadelphia. My walls become a forest. I do not
  know under whose sky I am. But my mother has left soup on the bedside table, the
  supper that, for my wildness, I was once denied. On the way to Üsküdar. I breathe
  in the displacement. Even as I write now, I feel I am imitating an intimacy I can’t
  truly grasp. It’s fragmented. I caught myself divided, thinking in English, and
  something shifted. I sing, soundless, with the afterlife of Eartha’s voice. I sit
  with her ghost figure scattered in my mind, accepting the mystery. In between languages,
  I have come to accept uncertainty, distance, <em>susuzluk</em> (“thirst”). I leap
  with the words from myself, unfolding with their translated lives. <em>Sıvılaşmış</em>.
  “Liquefied.” Mine sounds warm, with its doubled <em>ş</em>, whispering, melting
  matter, muddy with its muted, unembellished, <em>ı</em>. The other, “liquefied,”
  whose knifelike <em>q</em> is absent in my alphabet: how in the beginning it’s crystallized,
  and then dissolves. Hiss of water touching ice. Both words belong to the same substance,
  amalgamated, only different in form. And where they touch, so lightly, they absorb
  each other. “Su kristalleşir, buz sıvılaşmış” (“Water is crystallized, ice liquefied”).
  And I live right here in the middle, sometimes far, sometimes close, as now, when
  I listen to my mother tongue in this beloved other’s voice. <em>Üskü Dara</em>.
  A split destination, Üsküdar cut in half. My white walls reappear, and with them
  that capital “I” that is becoming. That grand “I” which I still cannot embrace.
  The “I” that I don’t want: the excess of the first person — too great and everywhere.
  A longing: “kendini paylaşan küçük ‘ben’” (“the little ‘i’ that shares itself”).
  An “I” distanced from its action, scattered almost physically. Some words I have
  saved: <em>içimde</em> (“inside of me”), <em>dışımda</em> (“outside of me”), <em>papatyalarım</em>
  (“my daises”), <em>ölüyorum</em> (“I am dying”). In translation, my “I” is separated.
  Severed. I want to catch it as it runs off.</p>\n\n<p>Driving to the western coast
  from Istanbul, I’m in the backseat, six years old, maybe seven, maybe nine, watching
  asphalt turn into sunflowers and then asphalt again. A memory outside of my Istanbul,
  where most memories had to belong. A memory from point A to point B. White storks
  wander in the fields. A few small stone houses, trembling, the smoke from their
  chimneys are different from the clouds. I watch a donkey waiting in the shade, his
  neck tied to the tree. “O gözleri mahzun eşek.” “That donkey with tragic eyes.”
  I remember him and sorrow overtakes me. And as we drive, I cry from time to time
  at what I see on that ten-hour road. We travel through everlasting moonflower fields.
  <em>Ayçiçekleri</em> (“Ay: Moon. Sunflowers”). My dad plays music throughout the
  entire drive, and I listen. “Le Vent Nous Portera” by the French band Noir Desir
  is playing: “Je n’ai pas peur de la route. Un instantané de velours. Et mon tapis
  volant dis? Le vent l’emportera.” (“I’m not afraid of the road. An instant of velvet.
  And my flying carpet says? The wind will carry us”). I don’t listen to that song
  much anymore. Now when we drive I put my headphones on, and listen to my own songs.
  But then, when I was six or seven or nine, among the moonflowers and all the distance
  between A and B, my parents shared with me all that was shared with them: The Beatles,
  Billie Holiday, Patti Smith, Lou Reed, Serge Gainsbourg, Hendrix, Zeppelin, Tom
  Waits. Faceless voices that meant so much to me. Some I lost and they never found
  their way back, some I met throughout the years. I do not belong to them, perhaps,
  but parts of them now belong to me. Billie sings:</p>\n\n<em><pre style=\"text-indent:
  10px\">Yesterdays, yesterdays\nDays I knew as happy sweet\nSad am I, glad am I\nFor
  today I’m dreamin’ of yesterdays</em></pre>\n\n<p>She shares herself with me. I
  share myself with her afterlife. A translated afterlife. Doubled. And so now I think
  about memory, the language of memories. I think of the many ways of representing
  the same thing. Noticing I am in between two wholly distanced ways of thinking,
  I undergo a change. A sort of alchemy. I see how a world outside of my own has seeped
  in, sweet like honey; it felt so natural that I missed the transition, and the loss.
  Whatever matter formed me before has amalgamated with another, and I am forgotten.
  In parting. “Not how one soul comes close to another but how it moves away shows
  me their kinship and how much they belong together” (Nietzsche, <em>On the Genealogy
  of Morality</em>).</p>\n\n<p>I look behind words. I look at their history, the points
  where they entered my history. <em>Ayçiçekleri</em>. “Moonflowers.” I will never
  say “this is this and this” because on the way from one to nineteen, I realize that
  no one meaning seals one word. So I laugh with the forgetfulness of rigid, indestructible
  definitions, and I let them multiply. My kingdom is of this world, says Nietzsche:
  “He collects from everything he sees, hears, lives through, his sum. He is always
  in his own company, whether he associates with books, human beings, or landscapes:
  he honors by choosing, by admitting, by trusting. He knows how to forget.” This
  figure who I want to be. Noticing how written words travel, and speak, in the strangest
  form. We are like pickpockets, stealing letters from Eartha and Nietzsche and countless
  others. Stealing philosophies, and placing them somewhere in between ourselves and
  those from whom they came. I translate for myself, and in a way, like Eartha, I
  share me with me. <em>Birleşiyorum</em> (“I’m fusing”).</p>\n\n<p>Every word a point
  of memory. I leap again, from myself, out the window and soar above the yellow.
  I’m in a train, by the window. Nineteen, my headphones on, from New York to Philadelphia.
  I watch red, rusty steel turn into concrete, into ghost towns with broken windows,
  into a mixture of grey and green, undiscovered fields. I’m listening to Tom Waits
  as I travel from home to home, in the train, to Philadelphia: “Come closer, don’t
  be shy, stand beneath the rainy sky, the moon is over the rise, think of me as a
  train goes by. Lay down in the green grass. Remember when you loved me.” The yellow
  fields slowly fade into the industrial landscape. I look at the factories, those
  factories I despised back home: here now they look like magic. Now at night, their
  clouds turn into fire. I watch these burning steel stars illuminate everything.
  A new memory sits next to the old; they look at each other and smile. “Üskü dara
  gider iken… Üsküdar’a gider iken…” The same but split. The distance from <em>üskü</em>
  to <em>dara</em>. That is where I lie now in my apartment, on my white carpet, in
  West Philadelphia, knowing that somehow somewhere point A and B meet. I listen to
  the song my father cried to as we drove:</p>\n\n<em><pre style=\"text-indent: 10px\">Yuksek
  Yuksek Tepelere:\nBabamın Bir Atı Olsa Binse De Gelse,\nAnnemin Yelkeni Olsa Açsa
  Da Gelse,\nKardeşlerim Yolları Bilse De Gelse.\n \nTo the tall tall hills:\nI wish
  my father had a horse so he could ride it and come to me\nI wish my mother had a
  sail so she could open it and come to me\nI wish my siblings knew the way so they
  could come to me</em></pre>\n\n<p>I am not satisfied with the word “nostalgia.”
  What I feel is not just longing, or missing my home. It is a rush of wind, stained
  with the violets in my garden, and the soup on the table, and the gloves Holden
  lost, and how his mother got mad at him, and the wild things that were told to be
  still, and became still, and the donkey with the almond eyes, and Eartha’s purr.
  I breathe in a violet wind. And as I breathe out, the wind takes something into
  the distance. Some sort of matter. It’s as if the wind takes the tangible away.
  As if my scarf has fluttered off, but the warmth it gave me remains. So whenever
  I am cold, I wait for another wind to blow it back to me. And it does, from time
  to time.</p>\n\n<p>“Once a little boy sent me a charming card with a little drawing
  on it. I loved it. I answer all my children’s letters — sometimes very hastily —
  but this one I lingered over. I sent him a card and I drew a picture of a Wild Thing
  on it. I wrote, ‘Dear Jim: I loved your card.’ Then I got a letter back from his
  mother and she said, ‘Jim loved your card so much he ate it.’ That to me was one
  of the highest compliments I’ve ever received. He didn’t care that it was an original
  Maurice Sendak drawing or anything. He saw it, he loved it, he ate it.” — Maurice
  Sendak</p>\n\n<p>I ate the peach, swallowed the violet wind. I lost the gloves but
  not the warmth. “Sımsıkı tutunarak uzakligin kendisine” (“Holding on tightly to
  distance itself”). I let the distance keep itself. And I let myself flutter from
  point A to point B… “yeryüzünü dönülmez bir yolculuğa çıkmışım gibi seyrederek,”
  as Hikmet says at the end of his poem “Things I Didn’t Know I Loved”: watching as
  if I’m on a journey with no return to earth.</p>"

tbio: "<p>Keyla Çavdar is a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying English
  and fine arts. She was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey, and moved to Philadelphia
  in 2014. She was reintroduced to revolutionary Turkish poet Nâzım Hikmet in Taije
  Silverman’s translation class in the spring of 2016; Hikmet’s poetry made it possible
  for her to understand not only the current political climate in Turkey, but also
  the implications of losing one’s country and language. Translation enabled her to
  dwell in the space between her mother tongue, Turkish, and her second language,
  English. Exploring the space between these languages brought about a consciousness
  of distance, which she writes about in <em>Notes on the Afterlives</em>.</p>"
