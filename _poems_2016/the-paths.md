pid: the-paths
title: Пътеките
transtitle: The Paths
author: Pavel Matev
translator: Mirela Zaneva
poem: "Пътеките, пътеките на птиците, \nна полуделите треви, \nостанаха зад нас, уви!
  \nИ в твоите сълзи —\nпо ресниците.\n\nСамотното ни връщане \nне ще ни отведе далеч.
  \nО, те останаха без реч \nот страстни ветрове прегръщани.\n\nЖеланото спасение
  \nпри спомена се приюти \nи с него се загърна ти — \nедно невиждано видение.\n\nНе
  ме търси… Не ме търси… \nЗагинаха сами плачът и любовта. \nИ оня смях. И радостта.
  \nС пътеките, с пътеките отминаха.\n\nПонякога в зениците \nще пламнат с таен зов
  \nту изгорялата любов \nили пътеките на птиците."
transpoem: "The paths, the paths of birds,\nof maddened trees,\nthey have remained
  behind, \nand hidden barely\nin your tears.\n\nThis solitary return\nwill not return
  us far.\nOh, these paths have left\nwithout a word, embraced\nby ardent winds.\n\nAnd
  I know you too have embraced\nold memories as shelter,\na wanted salvation,\na sight
  that’s still unseen.\n\nDon’t look for me. Don’t look for me…\nlaments and love
  have died alone.\nAnd if you think about the laughter\nand that joy — it’s with
  the paths,\nwith the paths, they passed us by.\n\nOnly sometimes in your eyes,\na
  secret call will set alight\nperhaps the love that burned,\nperhaps the paths,\nthe
  paths of birds."
note: "<p>My initial steps in translating a given work are attempts to place the poem
  inside a larger context of the author’s life, views, experiences. Afterwards, I
  begin with a quick translation, something crude and instantaneous. I focus on the
  new text and circle, underline, highlight all ideas that come up until there is
  more ink than words on the page. I then look at the original and take on more edits
  based on both the rough translation and the original. I rinse and repeat quite a
  bit over a day or two and then try to forget the whole matter ever happened. When
  I return to the poem, fresh connections usually appear. So far, this is what I have
  done with “The Paths.” The current version is still a quite humble attempt to carry
  over the images from Bulgarian to English. I have recently memorized the poem fully
  and have created a memory palace of sorts, with the hopes that this will aid me
  in future revisions.</p>"
abio: "<p>Pavel Matev (Павел Матев, 1924–2006) is celebrated as one of the best lyricists
  in Bulgarian poetry. Growing up in the countryside, he devoted his work to the study
  of nature and love, and focused on the quiet, simple beauty of both. He is considered
  notoriously difficult to translate because his distinct melancholic tone is rooted
  in his rhyme patterns and heavily embedded in the minimalism and succinctness of
  his phrases.</p>"
tbio: "<p>As a psychology major, poetry has not been central to my academic pursuits.
  However, after taking Professor Taije Silverman’s class, my interest in translation
  and my connection with poetry has grown. Nowadays, most of my time goes to applying
  concepts from game theory to evolutionary models, but translating has become a favorite
  hobby.</p>"
