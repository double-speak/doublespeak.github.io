  너를 기다리는 동안 - 황지우

  네가 오기로 한 그 자리에

  내가 미리 가 너를 기다리는 동안

  다가오는 모든 발자국은

  내 가슴에 쿵쿵거린다

  바스락 거리는 나뭇잎 하나도 내게로 온다

  기다려본 적이 있는 사람은 안다

  세상에서 기다리는 일처럼 가슴 에리는 일이 있을까

  네가 오기로 한 그 자리, 네가 미리 와 있는 이곳에서

  문을 열고 들어오는 모든 사람이

  너였다가

  너였다가, 너일 것이었다가

  다시 문이 닫힌다

  사랑하는 이여

  오지 않는 너를 기다리며

  나는 마침내 너에게로 간다

  아주 먼 곳에서 나는 너에게 가고

  아주 오랜 세월을 다하여 너는 지금 오고 있다

  아주 먼데서 지금도 천천히 오고 있는 너를

  너를 기다리는 동안 나도 가고 있다

  남들이 열고 들어온 문을 통해

  내 가슴에 쿵쿵거리는 모든 발자국을 따라

  너를 기다리는 동안 나는 너에게 가고 있다

  (1990년作 시집 '게 눈 속의 연꽃' 수록)

  As I arrive early and wait for you

  at the place where you promised to be,

  every step that approaches

  strums my heart.

  Even a rustling leaf steps toward me.

  Anyone who has waited for someone knows

  that there is nothing in this world that makes one’s heart ache as much.

  Every person who opens the door and walks in,

  into the place where you promised, where I arrived early,

  was you,

  probably you, perhaps you,

  then the door closes again.

  My beloved,

  as I wait for you who do not come,

  I come toward you at last.

  I come toward you from a very far place,

  and now you come toward me, as you have for a very long time.

  As you approach from far away, slowly even at this very moment,

  I come closer to you as I wait for you.

  Through the door that others opened,

  tracing every step that strums my heart,

  I come closer to you as I wait for you.

  (From <em>Lotus Flower in the Eyes of a Crab</em>, 1990)
note: "<p>Some poems are devised while others are improvised. This poem is the latter.
  In an interview, Hwang revealed that he wrote the poem in five minutes when his
  journalist friend asked him to write a piece for a teen magazine. Although he forgot
  about writing the poem, it became one of his best-known works after being recited
  on a radio show. The poet himself was ashamed of the poem for a while because of
  its “cheesiness,” but many readers could certainly relate to the excitement and
  frustration of waiting for someone or something dearly, and saw themselves in his
  writing. As you know, not all literature needs to be sophisticated. Some just brings
  you back to a different time and a different space.</p>"
abio: <p>Hwang Ji-woo (<span lang="ko">황지우</span>) is a famous twentieth-century poet
  from South Korea. He developed an interest in poetry after studying aesthetics and
  philosophy at two notable universities, Seoul National University and Sogang University.
  After fulfilling his military duty, he was expelled from university for participating
  in political protests against the Korean government. His political activism influenced
  his poetry to the extent that he has written poems to deliver his political message.
  His poems are also influenced by Buddhist philosophy, most likely as a result of
  his philosophy studies at Sogang University. He is one of the leading figures of
  the deconstruction poetry movement of 1980s Korea with his unique way of utilizing
  satire and depicting absurdity through experimental approaches. On the other hand,
  the general public is more fond of his talent for grasping ordinary moments with
  fine sensitivity — this poem is a good example.</p>
tbio: "<p>Jin Ah Lee is a graduate of the Integrated Product Design Program at Penn
  and is currently working as a startup consultant in Los Angeles. She has always
  been interested in learning new languages, and she considers language not only as
  a medium through which to communicate but one that expands her horizons. As a child,
  she learned English by singing Disney songs, and now thanks <em>DoubleSpeak</em>
  for helping her continue to revisit her passion for cross-cultural connection through
  her contribution to the magazine.</p>"
