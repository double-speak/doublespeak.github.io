author: Anna Akhmatova
translator: Yehudith Dashevsky
poem: "                Нет, и не под чуждым небосводом,\n                И не под
  защитой чуждых крыл,-\n                Я была тогда с моим народом,\n                Там,
  где мой народ, к несчастью, был.\n                                        1961\n\n<h1>Вместо
  предисловия</h1>\n\n    <p>В страшные годы ежовщины я провела семнадцать \nмесяцев
  в тюремных очередях в Ленинграде. Как-то раз \nкто-то \"опознал\" меня. Тогда стоящая
  за мной женщина, \nкоторая, конечно, никогда не слыхала моего имени, \nочнулась
  от свойственного нам всем оцепенения и \nспросила меня на ухо (там все говорили
  шепотом):</p>\n     <p>— А это вы можете описать?</p> \n     <p>И я сказала:</p>
  \n     <p>— Могу.</p> \n     <p>Тогда что-то вроде улыбки скользнуло по тому, что
  некогда было ее лицом.</p> \n\n<p>1 апреля 1957, Ленинград</p>\n\n<h1>II</h1>\nОпять
  поминальный приблизился час.\nЯ вижу, я слышу, я чувствую вас:\n\nИ ту, что едва
  до окна довели,\nИ ту, что родимой не топчет земли,\n\nИ ту, что красивой тряхнув
  головой,\nСказала: “Сюда прихожу, как домой.”\n\nХотелось бы всех поименно назвать,\nДа
  отняли список, и негде узнать.\n\nДля них соткала я широкий покров\nИз бедных, у
  них же подслушанных слов.\n\nО них вспоминаю всегда и везде,\nО них не забуду и
  в новой беде,\n\nИ если зажмут мой измученный рот,\nКоторым кричит стомильонный
  народ,\n\nПусть так же они поминают меня\nВ канун моего поминального дня.\n\nА если
  когда-нибудь в этой стране\nВоздвигнуть задумают памятник мне,\n\nСогласье на это
  даю торжество,\nНо только с условьем — не ставить его\n\nНи около моря, где я родилась:\nПоследняя
  с морем разорвана связь,\n\nНи в царском саду у заветного пня,\nГде тень безутешная
  ищет меня,\n\nА здесь, где стояла я триста часов\nИ где для меня не открыли засов.\n\nЗатем,
  что и в смерти блаженной боюсь\nЗабыть громыхание черных марусь,\n\nЗабыть, как
  постылая хлопала дверь\nИ выла старуха, как раненый зверь.\n\nИ пусть с неподвижных
  и бронзовых век\nКак слезы, струится подтаявший снег,\n\nИ голубь тюремный пусть
  гулит вдали,\nИ тихо идут по Неве корабли.\n\n\n"
transpoem: "                No, not foreign heaven’s shield \n                Protected
  me, nor foreign wings\n                I was with my people then\n                When
  my people endured suffering\n                                        1961\n\n<h1>Instead
  of a Preface</h1>\n<p>In the horrid years of the Yezhov terror I spent \nseventeen
  months waiting in line outside the prison \nin Leningrad. One day somebody “identified”
  me. \nThen, the woman who stood behind me, whose lips \nwere blue from the cold,
  and who, of course, had not \nknown who I was, came out of the stupor in which we
  \nall were and asked me in a whisper (everyone whispered there):</p>\n<p>“Can you
  describe this?”</p>\n<p>And I said, “I can.”</p>\n<p>Then something resembling a
  smile slid over that \nwhich had once been a face.</p> \n<p>1 April 1957, Leningrad</p>\n\n<h1>Requiem
  II.</h1>\n \nMemorial hour strikes anew.\nI see and I hear and I feel all of you
  —\n \nThe one whom we scarcely dragged to the window to breathe,\nAnd the one who
  from earth’s bounds was set free,\n \nAnd that one, shaking her beautiful head,\n“I
  come here as if to my home,” she said.\n \nEach one, name by name, I want to recount,\nBut
  the list was torn up; there’s no place to find out.\n \nFor them, I have woven a
  shroud out of words,\nOut of their poor words, which I overheard.\n \nThem — I remember,
  all the time, in every place, \nNew woes cannot drive them from memory's space,\n
  \nAnd if time clamps shut my long worn-out mouth,  \nThrough which a hundred million
  people shout,\n \nLet the people recall me in a similar way\nOn the eve of my own
  memorial day.\n \nAnd if at some point, this country should see\nfit to erect a
  statue of me,\n \nMy consent I grant to this one note of grace,\nBut on one condition
  — that it be placed\n \nNot near the sea, where I first opened my eyes:\nWith the
  sea I have long since severed all ties,\n \nNot in the Tsar’s garden, near that
  much-cherished tree,\nWhere an inconsolable shadow searches for me,\n \nBut here,\nwhere
  for three hundred hours I stood in wait\nand where they didn't unbolt the iron-barred
  gate.\n \nBecause even in blissful death I fear\nforgetting the clamor of the Black
  Marias,\n \nforgetting how that dreaded car door banged\nand that old mother wailing,
  like a wounded hound. \n \nAnd let the snow melt, in streams of tears, cries,\nFrom
  the rims of my motionless, bronze-lidded eyes,\n \nAnd let a prison dove coo, somewhere,
  far away,\nAnd the ships sail softly by the Neva’s bay.\n\n"
note: "<p>One distinct feature of Akhmatova’s poetry is that it is precise. Akhmatova
  reads as if there can be no other word or sound or even syllable stress for each
  image and no other image for each meaning. Although I chose to focus on staying
  as true to her images as possible, there were several places where I chose to stray
  from the images. One such place is in the fourth couplet, “and the list was torn
  up.” The Russian language makes use of embedded pronouns, so the original reads
  “and (they) took away the list,” with an implicit plural actor. However, I thought
  that using another “they” may create pronoun confusion in the translation. It would
  not be clear when the “they” refers to the regime and when to its victims. I therefore
  chose the passive. Another such place is in the seventh couplet, where the original
  reads “and if (they) clamp shut.” There, I chose to include an actor, although “time”
  is not true to the image or meaning in its full sense. It is not to time, ie. old
  age, that Akhmatova is referring, but to Stalin and his men. However, because the
  original only had an implicit “they,” I chose to avoid explicitly naming of Stalin
  in the translation. Another significant change I made is in the last line. The Neva,
  a river in Russia, has a riverbank, not a bay. However, I thought that the perfect
  rhyme in the end couplet was more important for the tone of the poem at its close
  than preserving a well-known geographic fact. I admit, however, that this may be
  a contentious point, and native Russian speakers have all the right and reason to
  disapprove of this choice. A fourth change is adding specificity to the images in
  the third-to-last couplet, where I thought that only those who had undergone those
  times would understand what kind of door was banging and who was wailing. As a final
  point, I wish to clarify that “Black Marias” are the police cars that would come
  to round up citizens, often at random, to bring them to jail, or worse. A fear of
  those black cars was ingrained in the generation of that time.</p>"
abio: "<p>Anna Akhmatova (Анна Ахматова, 1899–1966) is one of the canonical poets
  of Russian literature. She grew up near the Black Sea port of Odessa. After studying
  literature in St. Petersburg, she, along with poets Osip Mandelstam and Sergey Gorodetsky,
  founded the Acmeism school of poetry, which valued the craft of poetry above its
  mysterious or symbolic qualities. Akhmatova was known for her rather terse, concise
  mode of expression, which soon became the model of a new form of expression for
  Russian women. Some of Akhmatova’s poems were, at a certain point, banned by Stalin,
  and still others remained unpublished, because they contained explicit anti-regime
  references. Despite that, her poetry continued to circulate throughout Russia. When
  her son was sentenced to ten years in a prison camp in Siberia, she attempted to
  have him released in various ways, including writing propaganda poetry for Stalin.
  During World War II, Akhmatova would read her poetry to soldiers in military hospitals,
  as well as write poems that reflected the voices of the people who were victims
  of Stalin’s regime. She became known as the poet of the Russian people.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Yehudith Dashevsky is a sophomore studying English literature with a concentration
  in poetry. She is a native Russian speaker, fluent in Hebrew, and is learning Arabic.
  She thinks that translation is at the core of what humans do every day in their
  lives — constantly translating from one register of language to another, but also
  from thoughts and ideals to reality and back again. Yehudith was first introduced
  to the methods of translating poetry in Professor Silverman’s Translation of Poetry
  class last spring.</p>"
