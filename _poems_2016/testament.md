poem: |-
  Lasciatemi sola con la mia morte.
  Deve dirmi parole in re minore
  che non conoscono i vostri dizionari.
  Parole d’amore ignote anche a Petrarca,
  dove l’amore è un oro sopraffino
  inadatto a bracciali per polsi umani.

  Io e la mia morte parliamo da vecchie amiche
  perché dalla nascita l’ho avuta vicina.
  Siamo state compagne di giochi e di letture
  e abbiamo accarezzato gli stessi uomini.
  Come un’aquila ebbra dall’alto dei cieli,
  solo lei mi svelava misure umane.

  Ora m’insegnerà altre misure
  che stretta nella gabbia dei sei sensi
  invano interrogavo sbattendo la testa alle sbarre.
  È triste lasciare mia figlia e il libro da finire,
  ma lei mi consola e ridendo mi giura
  che quanto è da salvare si salverà.
transpoem: "Leave me with my death.  \nShe will confess those words in D minor,\nthose
  words that do not demand your dictionaries.\nThose words of love uncharted \neven
  by Petrarch,\nuttered where love is ethereal gold,\nunfit to hug the curve of a
  mortal wrist.\n \nDeath and I speak as old friends.\nShe has been here from my first
  breath,\nmy ally in work and play.\nHer arms have held \nthe same hearts as mine.\nA
  reckless eagle, \nintoxicated by azure,\nshe has shown me \nthe true size of humanity.\n
  \nToday she will show me other scales,\nscales I vainly questioned;\nCaught in the
  cage of my six senses,\nmy head thuds against the bars.\nSorrow finds me as I part
  from my daughter, \nmy art not yet done.\nBut tossing her head back, \nDeath soothes
  my fears. Promises:\n<em>I will save whatever is left to be saved.</em>\n"
note: "<p>Translating “Testament” was a monumental task because of Spaziani’s musicality.
  Though I do not speak Italian, simply hearing the Italian and seeing it on the page
  was enough for me to know that I had to make sound a priority. At first, this awareness
  made my translation stray very far from the Italian. My work breached a line between
  translation and what Professor Suvir Kaul called transcreation, and I wasn’t comfortable
  with that breach. I wanted, rather, to honor Spaziani, whose reputation might be
  overshadowed by male Italian poets like Eugenio Montale and Giuseppe Ungaretti,
  although she was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature three times. So I
  returned to the Italian (with the help of those who speak it and a number of Italian
  dictionaries) and rewrote many of the lines until I reached the translation you
  see. Still this translation does not parallel Spaziani’s poem in terms of lyricality,
  but I hope it is a testament (pun intended) to her brilliance.</p>"
abio: "<p>Maria Luisa Spaziani was born in 1923 in Turin, Italy, and she died in 2014.
  At nineteen years old, she was the director of a small literary magazine, <em>Il
  dado</em>; her work there led to relationships with internationally renowned writers
  such as Virginia Woolf. A translator and scholar of French and German literature
  as well as a prolific poet, Spaziani incorporated motifs of the natural world into
  her sense of a long and thoughtfully inherited literary tradition. A longtime collaborator
  with the poet Eugenio Montale, Spaziani served as president of the Centro Internazionale
  Eugenio Montale. She published over seventeen acclaimed books of poetry and she
  translated writers such as Pierre de Ronsard, Marguerite Yourcenar, Jean Racine,
  André Gide, Francis Jammes, and Gustave Flaubert. Spaziani’s poetry has been translated
  into many different languages. Her <em>Star of Free Will</em> was translated into
  English by Irene Marchegiani Jones and Carol Lettieri.</p>"

  She is studying Biological Basis of Behavior and is on the pre-med track. She is
  also the editor-in-chief of <em>DoubleSpeak</em> and is so grateful to be able to
  translate and publish this magazine.</p>"
