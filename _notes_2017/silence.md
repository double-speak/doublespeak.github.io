pid: silence
title: МЪЛЧАНИЕ
transtitle: Silence
author: Dora Gabe
translator: Irena Natcheva
poem: |-
  Не помня думите ти — помня твоето мълчание и стаята, запълнена
  със наши мисли.

  Не помня образа ти — губят се чертите
  в паметта ми,
  но помня как усещах, че си тук,
  в широкото кресло, зад теб прозореца,
  веригата на Стара планина, високото небе
  и облаче, което плува…

  Ти пръв попита:
  Що мълчиш?
  Отвърнах ти:
  Аз не мълча!
  Погледна ме, усмихна се и заревото от стъклата
  обля лицата ни със светлина! Мълчание.
  Препълнено мълчание
  с любов и нежност и доверие!

  Да бяхме цял живот един до друг мълчали заедно,
  не биха думите посмяли да ни разделят…
transpoem: |-
  I do not recall your words — I remember your silence and this room, filled
  with our thoughts.

  I do not recall your image —
  your lines are lost inside my memory,
  but I remember how I felt that you were here
  in the big armchair
  with the window behind you, the ridges of the mountain, the tall sky,
  and the single cloud, swimming.

  You were first to ask:
  Why are you silent?
  And I replied:
  I am not silent.
  You looked at me, you smiled, and the glow of sun through glass bathed our faces in light.
  Silence.
  Overflowing silence
  with love and tenderness and trust!

  If we had spent this life together
  in silence
  words could not have dared to tear us apart.
note: "<p>This poem is deceivingly simple. The gravity of the sadness embedded within
  is difficult to express. This is in part because Bulgarian has a particularly rich
  vocabulary for denoting silence. In the last stanza, Gabe uses a direct verb signifying
  an explicit volition of being silent. Translating this into English seemed like
  an insurmountable challenge. Gabe further refers to a specific mountain, Stara Planina.
  I decided not to name this, because it would not carry the same situational meaning
  for an English reader as it would for a native reader. Another challenge in this
  text was translating the word <em>заревото</em>, which is a word borrowed from Macedonian
  that means “glow” or “light,” but has now come to shape the Bulgarian word for fireworks,
  <em>>заря</em>.</p>\n"
