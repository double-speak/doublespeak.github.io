title: Para que tú me oigas
transtitle: So that you might hear me
author: Pablo Neruda
translator: Naomi Bernstein
poem: "Para que tú me oigas \nmis palabras\nse adelgazan a veces\ncomo las huellas
  de las gaviotas en las playas.\nCollar, cascabel ebrio\npara tus manos suaves como
  las uvas.\nY las miro lejanas mis palabras.\nMás que mías son tuyas.\nVan trepando
  en mi viejo dolor como las yedras.\nEllas trepan así por las paredes húmedas.\nEres
  tú la culpable de este juego sangriento.\nEllas están huyendo de mi guarida oscura.\nTodo
  lo llenas tú, todo lo llenas.\nAntes que tú poblaron la soledad que ocupas,\ny están
  acostumbradas más que tú a mi tristeza.\nAhora quiero que digan lo que quiero decirte\npara
  que tú las oigas como quiero que me oigas.\nEl viento de la angustia aún las suele
  arrastrar.\nHuracanes de sueños aún a veces las tumban.\nEscuchas otras voces en
  mi voz dolorida.\nLlanto de viejas bocas, sangre de viejas súplicas.\nÁmame, compañera.
  No me abandones. Sígueme.\nSígueme, compañera, en esa ola de angustia.\nPero se
  van tiñendo con tu amor mis palabras. \nTodo lo ocupas tú, todo lo ocupas.\nVoy
  haciendo de todas un collar infinito\npara tus blancas manos, suaves como las uvas."
transpoem: "So that you might hear me\nmy words \ngrow thin sometimes \nlike the tracks
  of the gulls on the beaches. \n\nNecklace, a drunken bell, \nfor your hands, smooth
  as grapes. \n\nFrom far away I watch my words. \nMore than mine, they’re yours.\nThey
  climb up my dull pain like ivy.\n\nThey climb like this on the damp walls. \nYou
  wear the guilt in this bloody game. \nThey are fleeing my dark den. \nEverything
  filled by you, you fill everything. \n\nBefore you, they lived in the solitude you
  inhabit,\nand they are accustomed, more than you, to my sadness. \n\nNow I wish
  they would say what I want to say to you,\nso that you might hear me the way I want
  you to. \n\nBut the grieving wind often drags them away.\nAnd hurricane dreams sometimes
  knock them down. \nYou hear the other voices behind the ache in mine.  \n\nMourning
  ancient mouths, blood of ancient begging. \nLove me, my friend, don’t leave me.
  Follow me. \nFollow me, my friend, beneath this wave of anguish. \n\nYou have gone
  and stained my words with your love. \nEverything occupied by you, you occupy everything.
  \n\nI go making, from everything, an infinite necklace \nfor your white hands, smooth
  as grapes."
note: "<p>This poem is about a man trying to reach a distant woman through words.
  This subject is reflective of Neruda’s work and the work of all poets: he is engaged
  in a constant practice of reaching to make contact. It is a never-ending process,
  an infinite necklace. In my translation, I sought to maintain the languid, sleepy
  mood that I feel when I read the poem in Spanish. When translating to English from
  Spanish, however, there will always be times when the words sound rougher than they
  do in their original romance language. When I found myself struggling with that,
  I tried to mold the roughness to be a part of the process that the poem is meditating
  on, part of the reaching and the growing, part of the infinite necklace.</p>\n"
abio: "<p>Born in Chile in 1904, Pablo Neruda was perhaps one of the Spanish language’s
  most well-known poets. Though he often dealt with the themes of love and longing,
  he also penned politically inflected works and served in high-level positions for
  the communist party of Chile. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Naomi Bernstein graduated from Penn with a degree in English and creative
  writing. She now lives in California with her parents where the average age of her
  friends is fifty-three and she spends her days brainstorming how she can translate
  poetry for a living.</p>"
