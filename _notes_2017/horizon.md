transtitle: Horizon
author: Federico García Lorca
translator: Mira Revesz
poem: "Sobre la verde bruma \nse cae un sol sin rayos\n\nLa ribera sombría\nSueña
  al par que la barca\ny la esquila inevitable\ntraba la melancolia\n\nEn mi alma
  de ayer\nsuena un tamborcillo\nde plata"
transpoem: |-
  Above the sea-green mist
  a rayless sun spills down.

  Along the shore, shade
  dreams to the rhythm of the boat
  and a bell that’s always there
  weaves with what’s bittersweet.

  In my soul of days past
  a silver timbrel
  chimes.
note: "<p>Translating Lorca always involves a degree of surrender that I’m not normally
  comfortable with. My translation will not make sense because his poem does not make
  sense; he paints scenes of emotion rather than scenes of visual realism. As I translate,
  I read the Spanish over and over out loud until I find what feels right in English.
  I cannot explain why what feels right feels that way; for me that’s part of the
  joy of surrender.</p>"
abio: "<p>Federico García Lorca’s poetry is, in my opinion, some of the most beautiful
  in the world. In Spanish, his poetry has an extraordinary musicality to it. Indeed,
  much of his poetry was inspired by gypsy music and other lyric forms. I normally
  find reading Lorca in translation to be deeply dissatisfying because his musicality
  is difficult to convey given the diverse and primarily Germanic roots of English.
  In my translation, I tried my best to honor his sounds, and occasionally shifted
  some images from more direct translations so that they might better evoke the emotions
  that I feel they do in the original Spanish.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Mira Revesz is a senior at Swarthmore College, pursuing a special honors
  major that combines English, education, and religion. After graduation, she will
  teach high school English literature and ESL, and looks forward to reading Lorca
  and Sastre with her students in both Spanish and English.</p>"
