poem: |-
  Probabilmente uscì chiudendo dietro a se la porta verde, qualcuno si era alzato a preparargli in fretta un caffè d’orzo.
  Non so se si girò, non era il tipo d’uomo che si perde
  in nostalgie da ricchi, e andò per la sua strada senza sforzo.

  Quand’io l’ho conosciuto, o inizio a ricordarlo, era già vecchio o così a me sembrava, ma allora non andavo ancora a scuola.
  Colpiva il cranio raso e un misterioso e strano suo apparecchio, un cinto d’ernia che sembrava una fondina per la pistola.

  Ma quel mattino aveva il viso dei vent’anni senza rughe e rabbia ed avventura e ancora vaghe idee di socialismo, parole dure al padre e dietro tradizione di fame e fughe
  E per il suo lavoro, quello che schianta e uccide: “il fatalismo.”

  Ma quel mattino aveva quel sentimento nuovo per casa e madre e per scacciarlo aveva in corpo il primo vino di una cantina
  e già sentiva in faccia l’odore d’olio e mare che fa Le Havre, e già sentiva in bocca l’odore della polvere della mina.

  L’America era allora, per me i G.I. di Roosvelt, la quinta armata, l’America era Atlantide, l’America era il cuore, era il destino,
  l’America era Life, sorrisi e denti bianchi su patinata,
  l’America era il mondo sognante e misterioso di Paperino.

  L’America era allora per me provincia dolce, mondo di pace, perduto paradiso, malinconia sottile, nevrosi lenta,
  e Gunga-Din e Ringo, gli eroi di Casablanca e di Fort Apache,
  un sogno lungo il suono continuo ed ossessivo che fa il Limentra.

  Non so come la vide quando la nave offrì New York vicino, dei grattacieli il bosco, città di feci e strade, urla, castello
  e Pàvana un ricordo lasciato tra i castagni dell’Appennino,
  l’inglese un suono strano che lo feriva al cuore come un coltello.




  E fu lavoro e sangue e fu fatica uguale mattina e sera, per anni da prigione, di birra e di puttane, di giorni duri, di negri ed irlandesi, polacchi ed italiani nella miniera,
  sudore d’antracite in Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Texas, Missouri.

  Tornò come fan molti, due soldi e giovinezza ormai finita,
  l’America era un angolo, l’America era un’ombra, nebbia sottile, l’America era un’ernia, un gioco di quei tanti che fa la vita,
  e dire boss per capo e ton per tonnellata, “raif” per fucile.

  Quand’io l’ho conosciuto o inizio a ricordarlo era già vecchio, sprezzante come i giovani, gli scivolavo accanto senza afferrarlo e non capivo che quell’uomo era il mio volto, era il mio specchio
  finché non verrà il tempo in faccia a tutto il mondo per rincontrarlo, finché non verrà il tempo in faccia a tutto il mondo per rincontrarlo, finché non verrà il tempo in faccia a tutto il mondo per rincontrarlo.
transpoem: |-
  Did somebody wake up to rush him an orzo when
  he walked out and closed the green door behind him?
  Did he turn back? He was not a man to get lost
  in rich men’s nostalgia, he smoothly walked away.

  An old man when I met him — in my memory so he appeared — I was not even in school.
  That bald head, that weird, strange thing of his, a holster-like truss, struck me.

  Yet that morning he wore an unwrinkled, twentyish face, with anger, wanderlust, vague socialist ideals.
  Hard words for his father, a wealth of hunger and escapes on his back, and fatalism for his job, which knocks and kills.

  Still, that morning brought new warmth for home and mother, to numb it and forget he drank the cellar’s first wine,
  on his face he already felt Le Havre’s smell, of oil and sea, in his mouth he already tasted black powder and the mine.

  America, to me, was then Roosvelt’s G.I.s, his fifth army. America was Atlantis, America was my heart, my destiny. America was Life, smiles so white on matte paper.
  America was the mysterious, dreamy world of Paperino.

  America was then sweet province to me, a paradise lost of peace, of subtle blues, of slow neurosis,
  of Gunga-Din and Ringo, of Casablanca’s heroes and Fort Apache’s, a dream along Limentra’s pour, obsessive and incessant.

  What was New York to him, as the liner sailed by? Did he see
  the skyscrapers’ forest, the city of shit and streets, loud, castle-like? And Pàvana just an image, amidst Apennines and chestnuts,
  while English stabbed his heart with knives of sound.

  It was labor and blood, equal strain morning and evening,



  years down a prison of beer and whores, of hard days, of Negroes and Irish, Poles and Italians in the mine,
  sweating anthracite in Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Tex’, Missouri.

  He crawled back as many, little money, his youth already spent. America just a corner, America the shadow, the fog, faint, America the hernia, a joke like many others that life plays,
  the sound of boss for capo, of ton for tonnellata, of “raif” for fucile.

  An old man when I met him — old in my memory —
  I scornfully slipped beside him, young, without grasping how his face was my own, how he was my mirror,
  how time would blow us back, the spiral ends rejoined how time would blow us back, the spiral ends rejoined how time would blow us back, the spiral ends rejoined.
note: |-
  <p>In this piece, Francesco Guccini wrote about destiny and afterthought. The song focuses on the figure of Enrico* — Guccini’s great-uncle — who left the village of Pàvana in the early twentieth century to work as a miner in the US.</p>
  <p>I decided to translate a piece by Guccini because I see the organic evolution of the ``classical’’ tradition of Italian poetry in his work.** Due to my personal hobby of searching for conservative poetry — which is poetry infused with a certain sad love for small facts, for the imperfect life of men, for memory and roots, and for the careful crafting of phrases — in unexpected places, I cannot but pay homage.</p>
  <p>I chose this particular song because I see a moving celebration of how personal lives repeat, of how we actually share experiences that we perceive as solitary struggles with others — before and after us – in it. Second, it is an interesting instance of how much of recent European culture developed in constant dialogue with and about the US.</p>
  <p>*Called Nerico in dialect, and thus Amerigo.<br>**On the relationship between Guccini’s work and classical Italian poetry, I refer to <a href="https://www.academia.edu/6047679/Amerigo_di_Francesco_Guccini">this article by Paolo Squillacioti</a>, of the Italian National Research Council.</p>
  <p>In translating, I sacrificed literal meaning to favor the flow of phrases, in order to recreate the smooth rhythm of the song. Moreover, I often used direct questions where the original text does not; I decided not to translate <em>Paperino</em> as Donald Duck, and I stuck to Guccini’s pronunciation of the name “Texas” in the song, the truncation “Tex.”</p>
abio: "<p>Francesco Guccini was born in 1940 in Modena, Italy. He is known for being
  one of the foremost Italian <em>cantautori</em> (“singer-songwriters”). His first
  record, <em>Folk Beat n.1</em>, was produced in 1967, and Guccini released around
  twenty records in his forty-years long career. He is a teacher of Italian language
  at the Bologna off-campus school of Dickinson College. Guccini’s lyrics can be considered
  a bridge between Italian poetry and the singer-songwriters’ production of the Seventies/Eighties.</p>\n"
tbio: "<p>Stefano Pietrosanti is an Italian PhD student in economics. He has studied
  in Rome, Turin, and, now, at the University of Pennsylvania. His work mostly focuses
  on how the real and banking/financial sectors interact. Having always been convinced
  that excessive specialization is boring, he tries his best to also put some effort
  into literature and political thought. In these fields, he is a happy amateur and
  an avid reader. As such, he got most of his recent amateurish fun from thinking
  about conservatism in arts and politics.</p>"
