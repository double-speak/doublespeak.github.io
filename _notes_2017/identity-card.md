poem: "ورقمُ بطاقتي خمسونَ ألفْ \nوأطفالي ثمانيةٌ \nوتاسعهُم.. سيأتي بعدَ صيفْ! \nفهلْ
  تغضبْ؟ \nسجِّلْ! \nأنا عربي \nوأعملُ مع رفاقِ الكدحِ في محجرْ \nوأطفالي ثمانيةٌ
  \nأسلُّ لهمْ رغيفَ الخبزِ، \nوالأثوابَ والدفترْ \nمن الصخرِ \nولا أتوسَّلُ الصدقاتِ
  من بابِكْ \nولا أصغرْ \nأمامَ بلاطِ أعتابكْ \nفهل تغضب؟ \nسجل \nأنا عربي \nأنا اسم
  بلا لقبِ \nصبورٌ في بلادٍ كلُّ ما فيها \nيعيشُ بفورةِ الغضبِ \nجذوري... \nقبلَ ميلادِ
  الزمانِ رستْ \nوقبلَ تفتّحِ الحقبِ \nوقبلَ السّروِ والزيتونِ \n.. وقبلَ ترعرعِ العشبِ
  \nأبي.. من أسرةِ المحراثِ \nلا من سادةٍ نجبِ \nوجدّي كانَ فلاحاً \nبلا حسبٍ.. ولا
  نسبِ! \nيعلّمني شموخَ الشمسِ قبلَ قراءةِ الكتبِ \nوبيتي كوخُ ناطورٍ \nمنَ الأعوادِ
  والقصبِ \nفهل ترضيكَ منزلتي؟ \nأنا اسم بلا لقبِ \nسجل \nأنا عربي \nولونُ الشعرِ..
  فحميٌّ \nولونُ العينِ.. بنيٌّ \nوميزاتي:\nعلى رأسي عقالٌ فوقَ كوفيّه \nوكفّي صلبةٌ
  كالصخرِ \nتخمشُ من يلامسَها \nوعنواني:\nأنا من قريةٍ عزلاءَ منسيّهْ \nشوارعُها بلا
  أسماء \nوكلُّ رجالها في الحقلِ والمحجرْ \nفهل تغضبْ؟ \nسجِّل \nأنا عربي \nسلبتَ
  كرومَ أجدادي \nوأرضاً كنتُ أفلحُها \nأنا وجميعُ أولادي \nولم تتركْ لنا.. ولكلِّ
  أحفادي \nسوى هذي الصخورِ.. \nفهل ستأخذُها \nحكومتكمْ.. كما قيلا؟\nإذن\nسجِّل.. برأسِ
  الصفحةِ الأولى \nأنا لا أكرهُ الناسَ \nولا أسطو على أحدٍ \nولكنّي.. إذا ما جعتُ
  \nآكلُ لحمَ مغتصبي \nحذارِ.. حذارِ.. من جوعي \nومن غضب"
transpoem: "Record!\nI am an Arab.\nAnd the number of my identity card is 50,000.\nAnd
  my children number 8,\nand the ninth will come after the summer.\nAre you not angry?
  \n\nRecord!\nI am an Arab.\nAnd I work with comrades\nIn the quarry of stone,\nand
  my children, they number 8.\nAnd I carve for them their loaves of bread,\ntheir
  notebooks, and their clothes\nfrom this stone.\nBut never shall I kneel \nor beg
  for alms before your door,\nand so I ask: are you not angry?\n\nRecord!\nI am the
  Arab\nwho is called by no name,\nwho awaits the country that will come\nfrom the
  eruption of anger. \nMy roots became roots\nlong before my time of birth,\nlong
  before the ages blooming,\nlong before the season of cypress and olive\nwhen the
  grass prayed for nourishment. \nMy father comes from humble fields,\nand not from
  noble sirs.\nHis father before him was a country-dweller,\nwith a history but not
  a memoir.  \nMy house is made from sticks and branches,\nnothing but a shed to the
  warden.\nDoes the life in which I am called by no name\ncomfort you?\n\nRecord!\nI
  am an Arab!\nAnd the color of my hair \nis the coal from the quarry\nand the color
  of my eyes\nis the brown of the fields.\nThat which defines me:\nthe kuffiyeh, the
  checkered cloth\nand clasping cords on my head. \n\nMy address:\nI come from the
  village, Unknown to you.\nAnd from its streets, Nameless to you. \nAnd its men?
  They work in the quarry of stone.\nBut still I ask: are you not angry?\n\nRecord!\nI
  am an Arab!\nAnd you imprisoned Karmah’s ancestors.\nAnd you stole the homeland
  we once tilled,\nI and all of my children.\nAnd you left us nothing but pebbles,\nfor
  me and all of their children. \nOr shall your leaders take them, too?\nAs they had
  before threatened. \n\nWhat has happened has happened.\nBut be it recorded in the
  first of the pages:\nHate has no place for my people,\nAnd to thieve is the same.
  \nBut if I were to starve,\nI shall feast on the flesh of my oppressor. \nBeware.\nBeware.
  \nOf my hunger.\nAnd of my rage."
note: |
  <p>I have translated this poem all while sobbing tears that aren’t mine. The process of translation is as painful as it is beautiful, and I only hope to have given these words of suffering and defiance the justice to be heard that they so solemnly deserve, and I am sorry if they have not done as such.</p>
  <p>The pain of exile in the original — and in this version to an extent — is palpable, but the resilience of the human spirit, in all of its passivity, is inspiring. In this poem, I choose to focus not on regret, but on resistance, not on sorrow, but on struggle. I chose to do this because of the first time these words were spoken: boldly in front of a thunderous audience in a Nazareth movie house in May 1965. This declaration served as an historic extolment of the Arab world and reverberated a uniting pride in Arabism.</p>
  <p>But I also chose to personalize the poem in a way that, though it betrays the original, allows for a dimension exposing my own identity. Towards the end of the poem, I translate a line as: </p>
  <p>“And you imprisoned Karmah’s ancestors.”</p>
  <p>The original, however, would read “and you stole the ancestor’s vineyards.” In Arabic, the word for “vineyard” is spoken as “<em>karmah</em>,” which also happens to be the name of my sister.</p>
  <p>In bringing my own lineage to this line, I hope to pay homage to the grief associated with the tragic theft of sacred human life that occurred in my family and in the millions of others suffering as a result of displacement and dehumanization. I hope to codify not just the courage of the Arab in the poem, but the resilience of the human spirit with which we are all blessed.</p>
  <p>Because to me, Darwish’s words are powerful not in that they are Darwish’s alone, but in that they are also those my father poetically recites as he drinks his morning coffee and those my mother beautifully sung as she nursed us to health that reveal the foundation of my pride in being a Palestinian living in America.</p>
abio: "<p>Mahmoud Darwish was a Palestinian poet and author, widely regarded as the
  Palestinian national poet and “the man of action whose action was poetry.” In his
  widely recognized and celebrated works, Darwish uses the notion of Palestine and
  the suffering of the Palestinians as metaphors for the themes of expulsion from
  the Garden of Eden, the beauty of birth and resurrection, and the anguish of dispossession
  and exile. Darwish was born in the village of al-Birwa in Galilee in 1941 to a landed
  family who had been there for countless generations. In 1948, he and his family
  fled their homes following the establishment of the State of Israel when Israeli
  forces assaulted the region, and, in the process, razed and destroyed the town to
  prevent its previous inhabitants from returning.</p>\n<p>After learning how to read
  from his grandfather, Darwish began to write poetry, publishing his first book,
  <em>Wingless Birds</em>, at the young age of nineteen. While also writing poetry,
  Darwish became more involved in political organizations, and he was ultimately banned
  from entering Israel in 1973 due to his affiliations. Thus, he wrote most of his
  poems and novels in exile, focusing on the painfully unfulfilled desire to return
  and the overwhelming feelings of nostalgia and resilience. With these tragic yet
  heroic emotions as the foundations for his art, he published more than thirty volumes
  of poetry and eight books of prose throughout his life.</p> \n<p>But even in death,
  Darwish could not return to his home. Immediately before he passed away in Houston,
  TX in 2008, he had requested to be buried in the village of his birth, al-Birwa.
  Such a request could not be granted due to the politics of the time, and he was
  nevertheless laid to rest in Ramallah, Palestine. His poems serve as a testament
  to the immense capacity for human suffering and the captivating beauty in resilience.</p>\n"
tbio: "<p>Omar Khoury is a student at the University of Pennsylvania lost between
  the worlds of Middle Eastern history and English. Born to descendants of Palestinian
  refugees, Omar finds solace in the words of Darwish and comfort in the recognition
  that his painful desires for a long overdue return are shared by millions of people
  in all regions of the world. He has grown up listening to the words of Darwish in
  the hope that he, too, may one day see the image of the village overlooking the
  sea that his parents enchanted him with in longing stories and begging prayers.</p>"
