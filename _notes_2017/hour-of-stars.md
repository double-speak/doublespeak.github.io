title: Hora de estrellas
transtitle: Hour of Stars
author: Federico García Lorca
translator: Mira Revesz
poem: |-
  El silencio redondo de la noche
  sobre el pentagrama
  del infinito.

  Yo me salgo desnudo a la calle,
  maduro de versos
  perdidos.
  Lo negro, acribillado
  por el canto del grillo,
  tiene ese fuego fatuo,
  muerto,
  del sonido.
  Esa luz musical
  que percibe
  el espíritu.

  Los esqueletos de mil mariposas
  duermen en mi recinto.

  Hay una juventud de brisas locas
  sobre el río.
transpoem: "   The silent sphere of night\nrests on the clef\nof infinity.\n\n    I
  set forth towards the street,\nnaked, ripe with poems \nI’ve lost.\nBlackness, tossed\nwith
  the crickets’ chant,\na will-o’-the-wisp,\nperished from the sound,\na musical light,\nperceived
  by the spirit.\n\n   Skeletons of a thousand butterflies \nsleep inside my rooms.\n\n
  \  Wild young breezes\nrush over the river."
note: "<p>Translating Lorca always involves a degree of surrender that I’m not normally
  comfortable with. My translation will not make sense because his poem does not make
  sense; he paints scenes of emotion rather than scenes of visual realism. As I translate,
  I read the Spanish over and over out loud until I find what feels right in English.
  I cannot explain why what feels right feels that way; for me that’s part of the
  joy of surrender.</p>"
abio: "<p>Federico García Lorca’s poetry is, in my opinion, some of the most beautiful
  in the world. In Spanish, his poetry has an extraordinary musicality to it. Indeed,
  much of his poetry was inspired by gypsy music and other lyric forms. I normally
  find reading Lorca in translation to be deeply dissatisfying because his musicality
  is difficult to convey given the diverse and primarily Germanic roots of English.
  In my translation, I tried my best to honor his sounds, and occasionally shifted
  some images from more direct translations so that they might better evoke the emotions
  that I feel they do in the original Spanish.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Mira Revesz is a senior at Swarthmore College, pursuing a special honors
  major that combines English, education, and religion. After graduation, she will
  teach high school English literature and ESL, and looks forward to reading Lorca
  and Sastre with her students in both Spanish and English.</p>"
