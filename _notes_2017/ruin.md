transpoem: "Press your cheek to scalloped stone and see how\ngiants fastened these
  walls, these gaping gashes\nnow plastered with moss once plastered by hands:\n \nhow
  knuckles leveled ruby tiles, shoulders carried\nslabs for miles, palms moonscooped
  marbled arches,\ninhuman fingers shaped this walstead.\n \nTrace the crooked gables
  and try to see these gates\nunbroken, kneedeep in nightfog rusted red and\nblanketing
  enemies laid to bed.\n \nRub the crumbling grains and try, try to see these walls\nuntouched
  — thriving, soaking, growing in battle’s blood\nbefore fate’s arm turned iron to
  mud.\n \nLie on your back, spine to stone and feel the echo\nof a ceiling crashed.
  In that lit city, slaughter probed\nthe foundations laid by those who by then too\nhad
  fallen in earth.\n \nThe builders have been buried, people passed\nthrough a grave
  dampened by baths now\ngripped in gray and gurgling ash, swallowed\nin wells of
  the past — one hundred generations\nand counting.\n \nBut when that goldbright hall
  is called, its vaulted\nceilings curved in gems, drawing prisms of sun, its\nwarriors
  wrapped in victory songs of that first joy,\nits wise courts rimmed in newgreen,\n
  \nmy mouth fills with the earth of that place, where\nwine-flushed skin and floods
  that gleamed, where\nthose twin pearls might be slipped beneath\nstony shadows shading
  over hot streams."
note: |-
  <p>“The Ruin” is rich in physically descriptive imagery of a ruined city. The exact location of the city alluded to, and whether it is in fact an actual city and not a spiritual metaphor constructed by the poet, is still debated by scholars. The belief that “The Ruin’s” author was inspired by Bath or another Roman scene guides us to imagine the author as someone in awe of the accomplishments of the master builders of ancient Rome; it is from this perspective that I wrote my own translation. Rather than viewing the city as a metaphor for the human body (which is not uncommon among medieval Christian texts) and exploring the poem as one with a moralizing, religious theme, I chose to wade through the emotions of reimagining a site that has been lost. The speaker of my poem asks what it means to yearn for a time that was never her own, to stand at the site of a sunken past.</p>
  <p>With the liberties that I’ve taken in writing “Ruin,” although I have attempted to echo the speaker’s meditative mood, my poem is more aptly called an adaptation than a translation, in terms of both content and form. An individual line of Old English poetry consists of two half-lines, where each half-line has two accented syllables, and the two half lines are bound together by alliteration of the accented syllables. While I did not consistently employ half-lines, alliteration and its coincidence with accented syllables was important in crafting the sound of this poem. One thing that I find most wonderful about Old English is its creation of new words through kennings and compounds, and in response I created original compounds in my translation.</p>
abio: "<p>“The Ruin” is a fragmentary poem found in Exeter, Cathedral Chapter Library,
  MS 3501, the Exeter Book. The ellipses printed here in the original Old English
  represent words that are now missing from the manuscript, after it was scorched
  in a fire. The author of “The Ruin” is unknown.</p>"
