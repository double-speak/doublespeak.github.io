transtitle: Take Me Into Your Black Eyes
author: Nurullah Genç
translator: Nicolette Tan
poem: "Daha dokunmadan kurudu irem\nçöllere bir türlü yağamıyorum\nyeni bir koşunun
  başlangıcında\nbiraz deprem sonrası\nbiraz şehir hülyası\nbir kalp yangınından geriye
  kalan\nsiyah gözlerine beni de götür\nartık bu yerlere sığamıyorum.\n \nPembe uçurtmalar
  yolladığından beri\nsarardı tiryaki menekşeleri\nsonbaharın tozlu kafeslerinde\nsevgi
  turnaları yakalıyorum\nturnalar gidiyor; ben kalıyorum\navareyim, asudeyim, yorgunum\nbilmiyorum
  neden sana vurgunum\nErzurum garında banklar üstünde\nuyku tutmuyor karanlıkları\nyitik
  düşlerimi kovalıyorum\ngölgeler gidiyor; ben kalıyorum.\n \nBinbir türlü kokuyorsa
  yaylalar\nsiyah gözlerine beni de götür\nbaharın koynundan koparıp sana\nipek bir
  mendile sardığım yüreğimle\nşehzade gülleri gönderiyorum\numutlar kalıyor; ben gidiyorum.\n
  \nBütün yelkenlileri,deniz fenerlerini\nkaptanları sorgulayan\nyanından geçen küheylanların\nkorku
  tufanına yakalandığı\nsiyah gözlerine beni de götür\ngüneş ülkesinden gelen yiğitler\nbenzeri
  olmayan bir dünya kursun\ncellat,ayrılığın boynunu vursun.\n \nUsul usul intizarı
  çürüten\nbu hercai diken,bu çılgın arzu\nsürüklüyor imkansız muştuların\neşiğine
  gönül vadilerini\nbir ağaçtan düşen yapraklar gibi\ndüşüyorum tanyerine\nya topla
  yaralı kırlangıçları\nya da bu vefasız şarkıyı bitir\nözgürlüğe giden tutsaklar
  gibi\nsiyah gözlerine beni de götür."
transpoem: "Before I touched the rain it dried out.\nI could not bring life to the
  deserts\nAt the start of a new day\nSome earthquake later\nSome city daydream\nRemains
  – a fire in my heart.\nTake me into your black eyes.\nI don’t belong here.\n \nSince
  you sent pink kites\nAddicted violets yellowed\nIn the dusty cage of fall\nI catch
  the love cranes\nCranes go; I stay.\nI am a wanderer; I am at peace; I am tired.\nI
  do not know why I’m in love with you.\nOn the benches of the Erzurum station\nDarkness
  doesn’t bring sleep\nChasing my lost dreams.\nShadows go; I stay.\n \nIf the land
  smells in a thousand ways,\nTake me into your black eyes.\nI will tear away from
  the bosom of spring\nMy heart covered in silk\nSending you the prince’s roses\nHopes
  stay; I go.\n \nThe questioners on the sea\nLighthouses, captains, the passing steed\nCaptured
  by a flood of fear\nTake me into your black eyes.\nBrave souls from the sun’s land\nShall
  found a country like none other\nThe executioner shall cut the neck of separation.\n
  \nGently I wait.\nThis rebellious thorn\nThis crazy desire drives me to\nThe brink
  of the valleys of my soul\nLike leaves from a tree\nI’m falling\nCollect the wounded
  swallows or\nEnd this unfaithful song\nLike a prisoner marching to freedom\nTake
  me into your black eyes."
note: <p>The first thing to know about Turkish poetry is that is meant to be spoken.
  That is important because of the many things not visible in print due to line breaks
  or punctuation, like emotion and emphases. The emotions of this poem, with the complement
  of music and tempo, set the base for my interpretation of this poem. With my rudimentary
  Turkish I am thankful for knowing Turkish pronunciation and basic sentence structure,
  which is essential to being sensitive to the internal rhymes and rhythm. I also
  translated this poem into my mother tongue, Mandarin, to see if I could gain more
  insight as well. For example, “biraz şehir hülyası” translated into <span lang="zh">小镇遐想</span>,
  which literally translates to “small town reverie,” I chose to translate as “some
  city daydream” instead for the repetition of “some,” as intended in Turkish. Verbs
  end very similarly in Turkish, resulting in a lot more opportunity for rhyme and
  gravitas in the original, which I tried to replicate by playing with word length.
  In this poem, there are also literary choices, like the dual meaning of “remains”
  in the aftermath of an earthquake, that are my own but are inserted in place of
  my failure to retain the double meanings in other stanzas. Special thanks to Deniz
  Uğur Kemahlı for his advice.</p>
