transtitle: STORY OF A SEPARATION
author: Nâzım Hikmet
translator: Keyla Cavdar
poem: |-
  <em>Erkek kadına dedi ki:</em>
  -Seni seviyorum,
  ama nasıl,
  avuçlarımda camdan bir şey gibi kalbimi sıkıp
  parmaklarımı kanatarak
  kırasıya
  çıldırasıya...
  <em>Erkek kadına dedi ki:</em>
  <em>-Seni seviyorum,</em>
  ama nasıl,
  kilometrelerle derin, kilometrelerle dümdüz,
  yüzde yüz, yüzde bin beş yüz,
  yüzde hudutsuz kere yüz...
  Kadın erkeğe dedi ki:
  -Baktım
  dudağımla, yüreğimle, kafamla;
  severek, korkarak, eğilerek,
  dudağına, yüreğine, kafana.
  Şimdi ne söylüyorsam
  karanlıkta bir fısıltı gibi sen öğrettin bana..
  Ve ben artık
  biliyorum:
  Toprağın -
  yüzü güneşli bir ana gibi -
  en son en güzel çocuğunu emzirdiğini..
  Fakat neyleyim
  saçlarım dolanmış
  ölmekte olan parmaklarına
  başımı kurtarmam kabil
  değil!
  Sen
  yürümelisin,
  yeni doğan çocuğun
  gözlerine bakarak..
  Sen
  yürümelisin,
  beni bırakarak...
  Kadın sustu.
  SARILDILAR
  Bir kitap düştü yere...
  Kapandı bir pencere...
  AYRILDILAR…
transpoem: "<em>And man said to woman:</em>\n— I love you, \nbut how, \nclutching
  my heart like something made of glass in my palms\nbleeding my fingers\nas if to
  break\ncrazed…\n<em>And man said to woman:</em>\n— I love you,\nbut how,\nkilometers
  deep, kilometers straight,\none hundred of one hundred, one thousand five hundred
  of one hundred,\ninexhaustible times one hundred of one hundred…\n<em>And woman
  said to man:</em> \n— I looked\nwith my lip, my heart, my mind;\nloving, fearing,
  kneeling, \nto your lip, your heart, your mind. \nNow whatever I’m saying\nyou taught
  me like a whisper in the dark…\nAnd I now\nknow: \nYour soil —\nlike a mother with
  her sunlit face —\nyou nursed your most beautiful child \nthe last…\nBut what to
  do\nit seems my hair is tangled\nto your fingers which are dying\nand saving my
  skin\nis unimaginable!\nYou\nmust walk,\nlooking into the eyes\nof the newborn child…\nYou\nmust
  walk, \nleaving me…\nShe fell silent.\nTHEY HUGGED\nA book fell to the ground…\nA
  window shut…\nTHEY SEPARATED… "
note: "<p>When translating Hikmet’s “Story of a Separation,” one of the things I had
  to work around was the fragmentation of Hikmet’s language. In a sense, the visual
  poetry he creates is reminiscent of William Carlos Williams, in that it guides the
  reader into a specific way of reading. It was very important to me to keep his method
  of writing and figure out a way to make it cohere in English; his lack of punctuation
  creates a difficulty, as it’s not as possible in English to establish Hikmet’s poetic
  method while also remaining coherent. In the spaces that we would expect punctuation,
  Hikmet disregards grammatical conventions and moves according to sound. I hope I
  was able to pass on his intention and the subtle changes in tone without moving
  too far away from the original.</p>"
abio: "<p>Nâzım Hikmet (1902–1963) was a Turkish poet, playwright, and revolutionary
  figure. He is considered Turkey’s first modern poet and was influenced by the Russian
  Futurist movement. Hikmet was jailed in Turkey for long periods of time for writing
  what the government claimed was revolutionary poetry. In 1950, Hikmet started a
  hunger strike protesting the Turkish government’s failure to include an amnesty
  law in its agenda. Later that year, Hikmet received the International Peace Prize.
  After his final release from prison, Hikmet moved to the Soviet Union. He continues
  to be revered by Turkish youth as the voice of revolution.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Keyla Cavdar is a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying English
  and fine arts. She was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey, and moved to Philadelphia
  in 2014. She was reintroduced to revolutionary Turkish poet Nâzım Hikmet in a translation
  class last spring, and his work made it possible for her to understand not only
  the current political climate in Turkey, but also the implications of losing one’s
  country and language. Translation enabled her to dwell in the space between her
  mother tongue, Turkish, and her second language, English.</p>"
