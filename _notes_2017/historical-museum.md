  历史博物馆
  ——人的一生，也可以象一座博物馆吗

  一

  最起初 只有那一轮山月
  和极冷极暗记忆里的洞穴

  然后你微笑着向我走来
  在清凉的早上 浮云散开

  既然我该循路前去迎你
  请让我们在水草丰美的地方定居
  我会学着在甲骨上卜凶吉
  并且把爱与信仰 都烧进
  有着水纹云纹的彩陶里

  那时侯 所有的故事
  都开始在一条芳香的河边
  涉江而过 芙蓉千朵
  诗也简单 心也简单

  二

  雁鸟急飞 季节变异
  沿着河流我慢慢向南寻去
  曾刻过木质观音浑圆的手
  也曾细雕着 一座
  隋朝石佛微笑的唇

  迸飞的碎粹之后 逐渐呈现
  那心中最亲爱与最熟悉的轮廓
  在巨大阴冷的石窟里
  我是谦卑无怨的工匠
  生生世世 反复描摹

  三

  可是 究竟在哪里有了差错
  为什么 在千世的轮回里
  我总是与盼望的时刻擦肩而过
  风沙来前 我为你
  曾经那样深深埋下的线索
  风沙过后 为什么
  总会有些重要得细节被你遗漏

  归路难求 且在月明的夜里
  含泪为你斟上一杯葡萄美酒
  然后再急拔琵琶 催你上马
  那时候 曾经水草丰美的世界
  早已进入神话 只剩下
  枯萎的红柳和白杨 万里黄沙

  四

  去又往返 仿佛
  总有潮音在暗夜里呼唤
  胸臆间满是不可解的温柔
  用五彩丝线绣不完的春日
  越离越远 云层越积越厚
  我斑驳的心啊
  在传说与传说之间缓缓游走

  五

  今生重来与你重逢
  你在柜外 我已在柜中
  隔着一片冰冷的玻璃
  我热切地等待着你的来临
  在错谔间 你似乎听到一些声音
  当然你绝不可能相信
  这所有的绢 所有的帛
  所有的三彩和泥塑
  这柜中所有的刻工和雕纹啊
  都是我给你的爱 都是
  我历经千劫百难不死的灵魂

  六

  在暮色里你漠然转身 渐行渐远
  长廊寂寂 诸神静默
  我终于成木成石 一如前世
  廊外 仍有千朵芙蓉
  淡淡地开在水中

  浅紫 柔粉
  还有那雪样的白
  像一副佚名的宋画
  在时光里慢慢点染 慢慢湮开
transpoem: "One.\nAt the very beginning   only the band of a rocky moon\nthe cavern
  in an infinitely dark and cold memory\n\nYou were walking towards me with a smile\non
  that cool and clear morning       the floating clouds parting\n\nIf I should trace
  that path to welcome you\nplease let us settle in a land of lushness and bounty\nI
  would pore over oracle bones to learn the secrets of augury\nfire both love and
  faith into rainbow pottery \nadorned with water and cloud impressions\n\nBack then
  \      all the stories\nhad begun next to a long fragrant river\nWade through the
  stream       hibiscuses in bloom\nthe poem was simple       and the heart too\n\nTwo.\nRushed
  flight of geese       the seasons changing\nAlong the river I slowly seek towards
  the south\nThe hand that once engraved goddesses of mercy\nhas also meticulously
  carved out\na Sui Buddha’s tender stone lips\n\nAfter the fragments spark and fly
  \      it finally emerges\nthose dearest and most familiar contours of the heart\nWithin
  the gigantic, wet and cold grottoes\nI am a modest and placid artist\nlife after
  life       mimicking trace after trace\n\nThree.\nBut       where did we really
  go wrong\nWhy is that       through a thousand reincarnation rounds\nI always barely
  miss that longed-for moment\nBefore the sands came       for you\nI had once buried
  deep all the signs and evidence\nAfter the sands came       why\nwould you always
  forget some serendipitous reach\n\nA struggle of return        might as well in
  that moonlit night\npour you a cup of wine through rapidly blinking tears\nBlast
  through the pipa       urge you to mount and ride\nBy now       what had been a
  bountiful land\nhas already entered myth       leaving behind only\nwithered willows
  and poplars       miles upon miles of desert dreams\n\nFour.\nTo go is to return
  \      almost\nconstant calls of the eventide in the shadowy night\nbetween the
  breast an indecipherable gentleness\nThe spring that even rainbow silk threads cannot
  embroider\nsinking farther and farther away       storm clouds gathering strength\nMy
  mottled heart\ngliding ponderously between legend and faith\n\nFive.\nReincarnating
  to meet you again\nYou live outside the cabinet       I already breathe within it\nSeparated
  by but a shard of cold glass\nI earnestly wait for your arrival\nBetween error and
  disbelief       you capture their voices\nof course you wouldn't ever believe\nthat
  every piece of samite and taffeta here\nevery painted man and earthen sculpture\nevery
  enclosed carved and engraved relief\nare my love for you\nmy persevering unwavering
  immortal souls…\n\nSix.\nIn the twilight you turn away in indifference       your
  steps fading\na lonely gallery       the deities falling silent\nI finally become
  wood and stone       just as departed memory\noutside the gallery       still a
  thousand florets of hibiscus\n\nsoft violet       gentle rose\nand that snow-like
  paleness\nmirroring an anonymous ancient likeness\nslowly imbibing from the stream
  of time       slowly diminish"
note: "<p>Xi’s poems are well-known and loved for their lyricism, references to ancient
  Asian (Chinese and Buddhist) philosophies, astute observations on life and love,
  and yearning for empathy and meaning. I tried to translate the poem literally before
  returning to try to restore some of the original Chinese lyricism; in the end, I
  stayed fairly true to the poem’s original structure but missed out on some of the
  rhyme. I particularly struggled with the third and fifth stanzas due to her rampant
  use of repeating Chinese characters. I am fairly proud of my translation of the
  sixth stanza, though, which is also my personal favorite from the original poem
  – I feel like I was able to capture what I loved from the original poem while giving
  it an additional spin of my own.</p>"
