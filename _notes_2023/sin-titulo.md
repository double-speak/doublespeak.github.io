transtitle: Without a title
author: Rosalía de Castro
translator: James Mesiti
poem: |-
  Una sombra tristísima, indefinible y vaga
  Como lo incierto, siempre ante mis ojos va
  Tras de otra vaga sombra que sin cesar la huye,
  Corriendo sin cesar.
  Ignoro su destino…mas no sé por qué temp
  al ver su ansia mortal,
  que ni han de parar nunca, ni encontrarse jamás.
transpoem: "A melancholic and indefinable shadow, blurry\nlike all that is uncertain,
  before my eyes always follows\nanother blurry shadow that without rest tries to
  escape,\nrunning restlessly.\nIts destiny I ignore… but I am not sure why I am scared
  \nupon seeing such mortal longing\nas they must never stop, nor ever meet."
note: "<p>When translating the work of Rosalía de Castro, two of the most difficult
  — albeit most important — qualities are the ambiguity and musicality in which her
  verses and poetic subjects operate. Spanish allows for ambiguity and wordplay that
  must be defined when translating into English. One of the first challenges to this
  respect was the use of the neuter noun “lo incierto” in the second verse. The options
  were changing “lo incierto” from a noun to an additional adjective, “uncertain”
  specifically, perhaps by applying it to the previous phrase: “A melancholic, indefinable,
  and uncertain shadow.” I chose to keep the grammatical syntax of the verse as is
  but introduced the noun/adjective pairing of “all is ambiguous.” This struggle with
  the intentional ambiguity of Castro was also present in the second to last verse
  and the possessive adjective of “su.” The translation of this word to “such,” while
  ridding the verse of its possessive qualities, maintains a level of ambiguity as
  to who, or which shadow, the “mortal longing” refers to without having to make a
  creative decision on the matter. Difficulties with Castro’s lyrical fluidity and
  musicality manifest themselves in a similar manner. The second to the fourth verses
  were particularly challenging in this regard. For example, the repetition of “sin
  cesar” in the third and fourth together with the alliteration of the “c” required
  a compromise in order to maintain the fluidity of the text while sacrificing a direct
  repetition of “without rest.” A more exact translation of “sin cesar” may have been
  “without stopping” or “incessantly.” However, this would have made it perhaps impossible
  to translate the employed alliteration.</p> \n<p>Maintaining these characteristics
  were the two main priorities of this translation, which may have provoked other
  sacrifices. Rosalía de Castro is known for being a precursor to free verse poetry
  for the time period in which she was writing. This being said, while there tends
  to be irregularities from one verse to the next in terms of metric, there may be
  intention to what her metrics were even though they do not match from verse to verse.
  This translation does not follow any metric and is in complete free verse.</p> \n"
abio: "<p>Rosalía de Castro (Feb. 23, 1837 – July 15, 1888) hails from Santiago de
  Compostela, Spain. There are not many documents in regard to her early life. However,
  it is known that her father José Martínez Viojo was a priest and thus could not
  recognize her as his daughter. Her mother, Teresa de Castro, was a member of high
  Galician society and was thus forced to keep her birth clouded in secrecy. As such,
  for much of Rosalía de Castro’s early infant life, she was cared for by her paternal
  aunts away from Santiago before returning to live with her birth mother. She would
  come to develop a close relationship with her that would later inspire some of her
  poetic work. In 1858, she married Manuel Murguía, with whom she had seven children.
  Their marital history, like much of the life of de Castro, is uncertain and contradictory
  in terms of opinions among academics. It is partly assumed that the marriage was
  not founded in love, but was sought by de Castro as a means of establishing legitimacy
  due to the circumstances that surrounded her birth. However, it is known that Murguía
  changed the order and format of some of the poems in <em>En las orillas del Sar</em>
  (1884), the poetry book where this translation comes from, with the intention of
  partially shielding de Castro from criticism which she may have received from the
  church, particularly when considering her existentialism and lyrical questioning
  of death. Prior and in addition to <em>En las orillas del Sar</em>, de Castro’s
  earlier books <em>Cantares Gallegos</em> (1863) and <em>Follas novas</em> (1880)
  were not published originally in Spanish but in Gallego. Based on her work and the
  biographical information that does exist, it is known that de Castro lived “indicada”
  and tormented, perhaps in part for not being able to be recognized by her father
  and what this meant for the rest of her life. De Castro is considered a precursor
  to poetic Modernism for her irregularities in terms of metric and, as stated, her
  existentialism. She has since enjoyed a mythification of her figure, not only in
  Spain but also in the greater Hispanic world.</p>"
tbio: "<p>James Mesiti, a native of Albany, New York, is a researcher and poet. In
  fall 2022, he began a doctoral program in Spanish and Portuguese at the University
  of Pennsylvania where his research focuses on modern and contemporary transatlantic
  Hispanic poetry. In October 2021, he published his first poetry book titled <em>Algo
  de nadie</em> (<em>Something of No One</em>) with Valparaiso Ediciones.</p>"
