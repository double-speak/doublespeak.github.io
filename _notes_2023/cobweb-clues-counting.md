author: Jiemin Liu (刘洁岷)
translator: Yi Feng
poem: |-
  我在平原上数影子的数目
  记起一个细节的代价是
  忘掉更多的轮廓

  高速公路上，车流嘈杂地穿梭
  中国的农村已飘逝而去

  2013.3
transpoem: |-
  On the plain I counted the number of shadows
  The cost of remembering one detail is to
  forget more contours

  On the highway, the traffic was noisily shuttling
  Rural China was flowing away

  March, 2013
note: '<p>I like Jiemin Liu’s poems not only because of the nostalgia in the loss
  of the rural due to the industrialization in China, but also due to the estrangement,
  puns and dynamics in his poetic language. When I translated his poems, I tried to
  keep the original cultural features of the Chinese language in my English translation.
  For instance, the title of the poem’s literary translation is “Cobweb’s Traces:
  Counting” and the semantic translation is “Clues: Counting.” My translation is “Cobweb
  Clues: Counting,” which tries to combine these two translations. Cobweb, or spider’s
  web, in Chinese, is an abbreviation of an old Chinese saying, “<span lang="zh">蛛丝马迹,</span>”
  which refers to clues or hints, for discovering something secret or hidden. I keep
  the translation of the original Chinese saying to indicate the unique image in the
  Chinese saying, and I add “clues” — the implied meaning of the Chinese saying —
  after “counting” in the hope that English readers can see the subtle connection
  between cobweb and clues in their imagination. This poem is about the fast development
  of China and the industrialization of rural areas. The last stanza has a pun, which
  reminds me of Jean-Paul Sartre’s thoughts on William Faulkner’s nostalgia towards
  the old South, “Faulkner is the one who is sitting in a carriage moving forward
  but keeps looking back.”</p>'
