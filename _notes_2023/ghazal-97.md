poem: |-
  Şâd ol ey sâim-i hicrân yine bayrâm gelür
  Salını salını ol serv-i hırâmân gelür
  ‘Ahd ü peymândan iñen dönme iñen ey rakkâs
  Devrdür böyle bu kalmaz geçer eyyâm gelür
  Gelse ger raks iderek bezme o hurşîd-i cihân
  Tenüme cân irişür cânuma ârâm gelür
  Merhabâ eyleyesin ola ki devlet vire el
  Ey kalan rûze-i gamda gör e bayrâm gelür
  Ey Ziyâ’î niçe kırılmaya halk-ı ‘âlem
  Çünki ol piste-dehen gözleri bâdâm gelür
transpoem: "Be elated, you who fast in exile, for Eid once more arrives\nSwaying his
  hips, the flirtatious cypress arrives\nKeep your troth and pledge, do not renege,
  O dancer\nSeasons turn, this will pass, brand-new days will arrive \nIf he dances
  into our gathering, that cosmic sun\nTo my flesh the soul will return, to the soul
  solace arrives\nMy greetings to him: let good fortune extend her hand\nO you remaining
  in the era of sorrow, behold, Eid arrives\nO Ziyâî, may the folk of this world not
  overly pine\nFor he — pistachio-lipped, almond-eyed — arrives\n"
note: "<p>I wished to preserve some of the form of the ghazal because often only their
  meaning is translated which flattens them. This type of translation obscures much
  of the poets’ signature interplay of restriction and liberation. I preserved the
  <em>redif</em> (repeating word) while not attempting the <em>kafiye</em> (rhyme).
  To make up for the loss of rhyme, I played with internal rhyme in lines three and
  seven, introduced some word play in line six (“soul/solace”), and added alliteration
  in a few places. The addresses I kept as they are, including the <em>tehallus</em>
  (the poet’s self-naming). Müberra Gürgendereli, whose edition of Ziyâî I use, praised
  the poet’s relative simplicity of expression, so I strove for a measure of plainness.
  Still, I needed to indicate that this is a very refined verse that uses the full
  stylistic range of sixteenth-century Turkish. In line three, Ziyâî used two synonyms,
  <em>‘ahd</em> and <em>peymân</em>, of Arabic and Persian origins respectively, which
  I rendered into an old-fashioned native word and a medieval French borrowing.</p>
  \n<p>Turkish like Persian lacks grammatical gender. It has a single third-person
  singular pronoun instead of he or she, much like the singular they in English. The
  translation into a gendered language has to decide the gender of the beloved. I
  have imagined him as male to balance the constant feminization (and thus heterosexualization)
  in, for instance, an otherwise excellent Bosnian rendition of Ziyâî’s divan by Alena
  Ćatović. Related to this question of beloved’s gender is their or her or his ontological
  status: human or divine? Ghazals deal with both. Languages written in the Arabic
  script do not have capital letters, but those using Roman letters do, and can thus
  distinguish between a person and God. The beloved for me here is human and male,
  but of course he does not have to be.</p>"
abio: "<p>Ziyâî (“The Illuminated”) of Mostar is the <em>mahlas</em> (pen name) of
  Hasan bin Ali bin Hüseyin bin Mahmûd bin Yûsuf el-Hersekî. He was well-educated,
  an accomplished calligrapher, and worked as a <em>katip</em> (cleric) and a <em>vaiz</em>
  (preacher). Only a single manuscript of his <em>divan</em> (collection of verse)
  survives, dating to April 1584, which is kept at the Selimiye Library in Edirne,
  Türkiye. It features a range of classical Ottoman poetic genres, 641 poems in total,
  including no fewer than 510 ghazals, of which fourteen are in Persian. Ziyâî also
  authored a <em>mesnevi</em> (narrative in verse) about Şeyh Abdürrezzâk who falls
  in love with a Christian in a dream and has many adventures before returning to
  Sufi Islam. Three manuscripts survive, two held in Istanbul and one in London. Ziyâî’s
  commentary on a <em>kaside</em> (long praise poem) by the classical Persian poet
  Sâdi of Shiraz is attested in one copy, now in the Historical Archive of Sarajevo.
  He died of the plague in Mostar in 1584/85. An early representative of divan poetry
  among the Bosnian Muslims, Ziyâî influenced many later Ottoman poets of his background.
  His verses were often featured in compilations or anthologies (<em>mecmua</em>)
  across Bosnia-Herzegovina."
tbio: "<p>Denis Ferhatović (b. 1980) is a Bosnian-American scholar and writer, working
  and playing with English, French, Turkish, Indonesian, South Slavic microlanguages,
  and medieval Germanic and Romance languages. His essays, poems, translations, and
  co-translations have been published in <em>Rumba under Fire</em>, <em>Index on Censorship</em>,
  <em>The Riddle Ages</em>, <em>Iberian Connections</em>, and <em>Turkoslavia</em>.
  His scholarly work appears in various journals and essay collections. His monograph
  <em>Borrowed Objects and the Art of Poetry: Spolia in Old English Verse</em> came
  out in 2019.\n"
