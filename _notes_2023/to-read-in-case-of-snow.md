title: Te Lezen bij Sneeuw
transtitle: To Read in Case of Snow
author: "Esther Jansma\r"
translator: C.H. Henry
poem: "Een paar hoeken om en je staat in de stilte\nop een bodem, tussen oude muren,
  lagen metselwerkin\nzomaar een winter. Uit de tijd gestapt.\n\nHet vriest. Kinderen
  — theemutsjes op lompe beentjes — \nrapen takken en sneeuw van de grond net zoals\nzij
  eeuwen geleden deden tussen de stenen\n\nhet gemetselde lapwerk in het zwijgen van
  het hof \nwaar als je goed luistert ijle stemmen misschien\nde flarden van iets
  mateloos naar het heden zingen.\n\nDat is nu, vandaag. Het schemert al. De kinderen
  \nspelen zoals ze spelen, omringd door tijd\nwaar jij niet bent. Jij kijkt naar
  hun herinneringen."
transpoem: "Turn a couple corners and you stand in the silence \non the ground, between
  old walls, layers of masonry \nin just any winter. You stepped out of time. \n\nIt
  is freezing. Children — tea cozies on clumsy legs — \npick up branches and snow
  from the ground just\nlike they did ages ago between the stones \n\nthe masonry
  patchwork in the hush of the court\nwhere if you listen carefully, airy voices perhaps\nsing
  the fragments of something measureless to the present. \n\nThat is now, today. It
  is already growing dark. The children \nplay as they play, surrounded by time\nwhere
  you are not. You look at their memories. "
note: "<p>Most of my translation experience up to the present has been limited to
  workbook exercises and Dutch books. As a class, we have spent a considerable amount
  of time on significant pieces of Dutch literature like Anne Frank’s Diary. More
  recently, we have begun looking into songs and poetry — as a guitarist and singer,
  I have enjoyed our examination of music outside the U.S. I found Esther Jansma’s
  “Te lezen bij sneeuw” (<em>To read in case of snow</em>) after scouring the internet
  for a new name and title; I wanted to translate material that neither I nor my professor
  had read. After settling on this particular poem, translating it was not particularly
  difficult, save a few words I had never come across. The unusual speech structure
  of some lines caught me off guard. For instance, “Uit de tijd gestapt” is an unusual
  sentence that directly translates to “You stepped out of time.” The second person
  speech and simplicity of the messaging is strange for any translator aiming for
  complete accuracy. I enjoyed yet was momentarily confused by Jansma’s use of the
  word <em>mateloos</em> which I chose to interpret as measureless. Describing a song
  as measureless is not something I have heard of, but I found it to be an interesting
  choice executed by the poet. Lastly, the phrase “omringd door tijd waar jij niet
  bent” had me confronting my professor for guidance because the ordering confused
  me. I eventually settled on “surrounded by time where you are not.” The use of where
  seems strange until you consider that the poem is about existing within a memory.
  Overall, I am satisfied with the English version of the poem, and by translating
  it, I feel more connected with its nostalgic nature.</p>"

  <p>Esther Jansma (b. 1958) is from Amsterdam. She studied Archaeology and Philosophy at Amsterdam University. She now teaches geoscience at the University of Utrecht, but it is her work outside of the lecture halls that speaks to mass audiences in the Netherlands. Since 1988’s <em>Voice
  Under My Bed</em>, she has been writing and publishing poetry, and her talents in prose have not gone unnoticed — she has won the Dutch-language VSB Poetry Prize among other accolades for her various publications. In Jansma’s own words, a poet is “the rag-and-bone man, collector of remnants, moments, cracks in things.” Much like her day-to-day work of dating artifacts and estimating the age of trees, poetry is Jansma’s opportunity to stitch together stories from the remains of previous poets. Her interests may seem fragmented at first glance, but upon deeper inspection, her writing is only bolstered by her life experience as a mother, archaeologist, and Dutch academic in a world which frequently ignores the past.</p>
tbio: "<p>C.H. Henry is a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania currently studying
  communications and diplomatic history with a minor in theater arts. For the past
  two years, he has been learning to speak, read, and write Dutch, and along the way,
  he has had the opportunity to learn about the history and actively engage in the
  culture via the Netherlands — America Association of the Delaware Valley. His relatives
  and family in Nashville, Tennessee, are not directly Dutch, but he has enjoyed learning
  a language he previously had little to no knowledge of until reaching Penn. He hopes
  more students will pursue the same remote interests.</p>"
