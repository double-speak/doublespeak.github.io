title: Palik Tik Dainą Man
transtitle: Leave Me Only A Song
author: Paulius Širvys
translator: Ash Maria
poem: "Girdėjau tavo atdūsį\nKaip dainą iš toli. \nDaireis, kažką praradusi\nBaltam
  dienų kely.\nŠaukiau tave — neatmeni.\nNeatmeni — nereik.\nApeik mane kaip akmenį,\nKaip
  mirusį apeik.\nIr eik tu sau, kaip einama\nMylėti pirmąsyk. \nPalik, palik tik dainą
  man,\nTik ilgesį palik."
transpoem: "I heard how you breathe \nAs though a song far out. \nYou looked around
  for something bereaved\nOn the days’ white route. \n\nI called out to you… no recollection.\nRecollect
  you… don’t need to. \nPass me — a stone’s reflection, \nAs if dead, pass me through.
  \n\nAnd go the way, in which you belong\nTo experience love on its eve.\nLeave,
  leave me only a song, \nOnly the longing I want you to leave."
note: "<p>Before translating Paulius Širvys, I had made an intentional effort to avoid
  any attempt at translating Lithuanian poetry. Lithuanian has an incredibly rich
  catalog of intransitive verbs, alongside highly productive morphology, which leads
  to countless considerations that the translator must mull over. For the sake of
  capturing the poem’s rhythm and feeling, nuances must be removed. To illustrate
  this point, I will explain the layers in the Lithuanian word <em>besitrindamos</em>.
  The root of the word is <em>-trin-</em> which comes from the verb trinti meaning
  “to rub.” <em>-si-</em> is the reflexive affix. <em>Be-</em> is a prefix to denote
  that the action is happening for an indefinite amount of time. <em>-damos</em> is
  the feminine plural half-participle suffix to denote that the action is taking place
  in tandem with another. A long-winded, yet still insufficient, translation of besitrindamos
  might be “while rubbing against one another for some time.”</p>\n<p>Luckily, this
  poem did not include any words that were so complex, though there were still plenty
  of difficult decisions that I had to make. In the second and fourth lines of the
  poem, Širvys creates a linguistic harmony through the usage of <em>dainą</em> and
  <em>dienų</em>, meaning “song” and “day” respectively. Unfortunately, I was unable
  to find any way to recreate this harmony using the same simple language. This original
  poem also takes advantage of colloquialisms to reduce Lithuanian’s sesquipedalian
  morphology. This most often occurs with verb endings. For example, in formal Lithuanian
  it would be <em>daireisi</em> not <em>daireis</em> in line three, and <em>baltame</em>
  instead of <em>baltam</em> in line four. Again, I was unable to recreate this effect.
  In lines five and six, Širvys writes the same word, <em>neatmeni</em>, with the
  meaning of “you don’t remember.” For the sake of finding an equivalent rhyme in
  English in line seven, I had to make a slight departure from the original’s consistency.</p>\n<p>When
  sharing my translation with a Lithuanian writer friend, the last line was where
  they had their only reservation with it. In Lithuanian, the word <em>palik</em>
  is the imperative form of <em>palikti</em> meaning “to abandon/leave behind or in
  its current state,” but just writing “leave,” as my friend suggested, felt too ambiguous.
  Therefore, I had to affix the words “I want you to” in order to make it more clear.
  My heart also sank when I read this line for the first time, as I came across the
  word <em>ilgesys</em>, which does not have a direct translation in English. It is
  similar to the concepts of <em>saudade</em> in Portuguese and <em>toska</em> in
  Russian, but nonetheless the concept is deeply rooted in Lithuanian culture and
  history. From conversations with Lithuanian friends, the best way I can describe
  <em>ilgesys</em> is as the following: “an unsettled, arcane longing for a time,
  place, or person forever out of reach.” In the contemporary Lithuanian conscious,
  <em>ilgesys</em> is often understood in reference to the idealized free Lithuania
  of the interwar years.</p>\n\n \n\n"
abio: "<p>Paulius Širvys (1920 – 1979) was a popular Lithuanian poet and journalist
  who spent his childhood in a free Lithuania, but his adult life entirely under occupation.
  After the death of his parents and brother at an early age, Širvys was placed in
  an orphanage. He pursued the life of a rural farmer until the beginning of World
  War II, when he moved to Vilnius to receive military training. While serving, he
  was able to survive despite twice being captured by the Nazis. However, in 1944,
  he was badly injured as a combatant in the Red Army. A decade after the war, he
  devoted his energy to writing, serving as editor for the Lithuanian Writers’ Union’s
  magazine <em>Literatūra ir menas</em> (<em>Literature and Art</em>). He then studied
  at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow. In 1973, he received the Lithuanian
  SSR State Prize for his poem <em>Ilgesys – ta giesmė</em> (<em>Longing is this Song</em>).</p>\n
  \n<p>He is no longer a household name in Lithuania today, but in literary circles
  he is still considered to be one of the most important writers of the Soviet period.
  In 1995, a poetry award (Paulius Širvio literatūrinė premija) was founded in his
  honor. Like other Soviet artists, his early works were in the socialist realist
  style and were largely concerned with issues of war. His later works were much more
  romantic, with the Lithuanian concept of ilgesys being a common focal point of this
  style of writing. The poems from this period have an intimate levity through the
  frequent usage of alliteration and parallelism, in addition to a disposition for
  Lithuanian folk imagery and language.</p>"

  <p>Ash Maria is a first-generation college student double-majoring in anthropology and Russian and Eastern European studies at Pomona College. Despite entering college monolingual, at Pomona he was able to study Eastern Armenian, French, German, Lithuanian, Portuguese, and Russian. They spent the last summer living in Vilnius, Lithuania, where they completely fell in love with the Lithuanian language and realized that they wanted to spend their career studying and translating its literature. He has also published poetry translations of Anton Ochirov’s work from Russian and translated for the independent media outlet <em>Meduza</em>. They are currently applying to Ph.D. programs in both comparative literature and Slavic studies.
