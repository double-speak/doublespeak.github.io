poem: "सुनो\nसुनो तो सही\nमेरे आसपास बँधा हुआ ये जाल मत तोड़ो\nमैंने सारी उम्र इसमें
  से निकलने का यत्न किया है\nइससे बँधा हुआ काँटा-काँटा मेरा परिचित है\nपर ये सारे
  हीं काँटे मरते देखते-देखते उगे हैं\nरात को सोने से पहले\nमैं इनके बालों को हाथो
  से सहलाकर सोयी थी\nऔर सुबह उठते हीं\nइनके वो मुँह तीखे हो गये हैं\nतो दोष किसका
  है दोस्त!\n\nसुनो,\nमिन्नत करती हूँ सुनो तो सही\nमुझे फूलों की ज़रूरत नहीं है\nउनके
  रंगों को देखकर जो ख़ुश होती\nवो नज़र नहीं रही\nइस जाल की ख़ुशबू मेरी साँसों में
  बंध गयी है\nमैं फूलों को लेकर क्या करूँगी\n\nसुनो,\nमैं तुम्हारी मिन्नत करती हूँ\nसुनो,
  मेरा जाल मत काटो\nमुझे परबस रहने दो\nमुझे इस जाल के भीतर\nबड़ा चैन मिलता है मित्तर!\n\nइसमें
  से निकलने के जितने हीले\nमुझे इसके बीच रहकर सूझते हैं\nइसके बाहर वो कहाँ\nउम्र की
  यह कठिन बेला\nमुझे काटने दो इस जाल के भीतर दबकर\nचलो, अब दूर हो जाओ\nजाल के काँटों
  के बहुत-से मुँह\nमेरे कलेजे में खुभे हुए हैं\nजाल काटते हीं अगर ये मुझमें टूट गये\nतो
  मत पूछो क्या होगा\nबुजुर्ग कहते हैं—\nटूटे हुए काँटों का बड़ा दर्द होता है.\n\n\nSunoh\nSunoh
  toh sahi\nMere aaspaas bandha hua yeh jaal mat todo\nMaine saari umr ismein se nikalne
  ka yatn kiya hai\nIssein bandha hua kaanta-kaanta mera parichit hai\nPar ye saare
  heen kaante marte dekhte-dekhte uge hain\nRaat ko sone se pehle main inke baalon
  ko haatho sehlaakar soyi thi \nAur subah uthte heen\nInke vo munh teekhe ho gaye
  hain\nToh dosh kiska hai dost!\n\nSunoh,\nMinnat karti hoon sunoh toh sahi\nMujhe
  phoolon ki zaroorat nahin hai\nUnke rangon ko dekhkar jo khush hoti\nVo nazar nahin
  rahi\nIss jaal ki khushboo meri saason mein bandh gayi hai\nMain phoolon ko lekar
  kya karoongi\n\nSunoh,\nMain tumhaari minnat karti hoon\nSunoh, mera jaal mat kaanto\nMujhe
  parbas rehne do\nMujhe iss jaal ke bheetar bada chain milta hai mittar!\n\nIsmein
  se nikalne ke jitne hile\nMujhe iske beech rehkar soojhte hain\nIske baahar vo kahaan
  \nUmr ki yeh kathin bela \nMujhe kaantne do iss jaal ke bheetar dabaakar\nChalo,
  abh door ho jao\nJaal ke kaanton ke bahaut-se munh\nMere kaleje main khubhe hue
  hain\nJaal kaathte heen agar yeh mujhmen toot gaye\nToh mat poocho kya hoga\nBujurg
  kehte hain—\nToote hue kaanton ka bada dard hota hai\n"
transpoem: "Listen, do listen,\ndon’t break this net tied around me.\nMy whole life,
  I have tried to get out of it.\nI’m familiar with the thorns bound to it,\nbut all
  of these thorns have grown witnessing death.\nBefore sleeping at night,\nI laid
  down with a hand caressing their hair.\nAnd when I wake up in the morning,\nthat
  mouth of theirs has become sharp.\nSo who’s to blame, my friend!\n\nListen, \nI
  beg of you, do listen.\nI don’t have any need for flowers.\nShe who used to become
  content upon seeing their color,\nher gaze didn’t remain.\nThe scent of this net
  has been bound in my very breath.\nWhat will I do with flowers?\n\nListen,\nI’m
  begging you.\nListen, don’t cut my net.\nJust leave me be.\nI find great comfort\nwithin
  this net, my friend!\n\nAs much as as you shake to get out of it,\nI understand
  through living within it.\nWhere are they outside, \nthe hard times of this age?\nLet
  me bite this net, buried inside.\nCome on, distance yourself.\nThe many-mouths of
  the net’s teeth\nare doing well in my liver.\nIf, while biting the net, they break
  within me, \nthen don’t ask what will happen.\nThe elders say—\nBroken thorns cause
  ample pain."

  <p>Translating <span lang="hi">जाल</span> was, more than anything, an exercise in patience — clearing the straits of my lack of expertise in reading Devanagari script and the poet’s extensive use of metaphor and imagery that, often, proved difficult to understand as a non-native Hindi speaker.</p>

  <p>I began by transferring the poem from Devanagari to a phonetic version in Latin script. I learned Hindi by listening, and being able to link words to sound proved the most effective method of finding meaning in the text. From there I translated the poem literally, then adjusted the language of my translation to account for Sachdev’s tone and my interpretation of her intentions.</p>

  <p><span lang="hi">जाल</span> is a poem meant to be read out loud; Hindi poetry has a wonderful lyrical quality, rhythmic and rich on the tongue. This musicality falls flat in a language like English, whose semantics and phonetics lend themselves to harder, shorter consonants and singular meaning. To remedy this, I focused on enhancing the poem’s emotional aspect through my use of diction.</p>

  <p>I chose to preserve much of the poem’s structure, placing line breaks and stanzas in similar places; however, I also added capitalization — a feature that Hindi lacks completely — and punctuation where it didn’t exist prior for stylistic purposes. While the original can be read with minimal punctuation, almost intuitively, the same transitions between thoughts read much less naturally in English. However, while I sought to keep the structure similar, preserving the meaning in the same direct way was much more difficult. Many phrases are untranslatable, or can be translated multiple ways.</p>

  <p>For example, <span lang="hi">सुनो तो सही</span>, a line that I translated as “do listen,” has no English equivalent. In its original form, it evokes a sense of both invitation and desperation, as if the poet is beseeching an unhearing stranger or seeking company between the bars of a jail cell. Similarly, <span lang="hi">कलेजे</span> can be translated as both heart and liver. I chose liver for the gruesome, honest tone it lends to the poet’s narrative, while heart would have alluded in some ways to a romance that the text doesn’t contain.</p>

  <p>Rather than accuracy, I sought to capture the poem’s emotional essence — the poet’s clinging to familiar pain, her simultaneous self-destruction and consumption of that which traps her.</p>

  <p>A poet and novelist hailing from India, Padma Sachdev (April 17, 1940 – August 4, 2021) is widely acknowledged as the first modern female poet to write in Dogri — an Indo-Aryan language native to India’s Jammu district. She also wrote extensively in Hindi, Urdu, and Punjabi.</p>

  <p>Known for her lyrical, often deeply personal verse, she is regarded as a luminary of Dogri culture, evoking in her readers the beauty and nostalgia of their language — and of their nation. Through her intimate descriptions of mundane life, her own emotional turmoil, and the lands she was raised on, Sachdev’s love for her heritage is evident.</p>

  <p>In India, Sachdev is celebrated among the nation’s most prominent female poets and contributors to Indian literature, and her death was regarded as a loss for her home state of Jammu and Kashmir. She was awarded the Padma Shri, India’s fourth-highest civilian honor, for her work.</p>

  <p>Sachdev also received the Sahitya Akademi award for her collection <span lang="hi">मेरी कविता मेरे गीत</span> (My Poems, My Songs), a work which inspired Hindi poet and freedom fighter Ramdhari Singh Dinkar to declare, “After reading Padma’s poems, I felt I should throw my pen away—for what Padma writes is true poetry.”</p>
tbio: "<p>Abigail Tuscano (b. 2005) is a high school junior from Texas, and a first-generation
  Indian-American born to immigrant parents from Maharashtra. A native speaker of
  Kadodi, an Indian dialect with eclectic roots in languages like Marathi and Konkani
  that contains loanwords from Portuguese, she is also working to learn Hindi, Urdu,
  and Spanish. Her loss of fluency in her heritage language at an early age — and
  the resultant loss of a cultural anchor — inspired her to turn to language-learning
  as a way of circling back to something akin to the voices and stories of her childhood.</p>"
