title: 山居即事
transtitle: 'Living in the Hills: Impromptu Verses'
author: Wang Wei (王維)
translator: Yudi Xie
poem: "寂寞掩柴扉，蒼茫對落暉。\n鶴巢松樹遍，人訪蓽門稀。 \n綠竹含新粉，紅蓮落故衣。\n渡頭煙火起，處處採菱歸。 "
transpoem: "In solitude I silently closed \nThe brushwood lattice-gate, facing\nThe
  setting sun whose shine is as vast\nand boundless as this moment. \n\nAs the cranes
  have found themselves homes \nEverywhere\nin the pine trees,\nVisitors seldom come
  to my grass-woven door. \n\nBamboos of green are newly coated\nby a thin layer of
  powders, \nwhile the lotuses of red \nhave just peeled her old dress. \n\nSmoke
  and flames are looming out of the darkness\nfrom the ferry afar, \nenveloping the
  silhouettes of the ladies upon their return\nfrom harvesting water-chestnuts. \n"
note: <p>I always begin my translation process by trying to sense in my mind what
  the poet sensed in the moment when the poem was written. I use my imagination to
  reconstruct and to repaint for myself the picture that the poet sees in nature and
  paints; I imagine the light and heat in the moment, the brightness and transparency
  of the air before me, the coolness of the evening wind surrounding me. Due to my
  passion for remembering and enlivening the experiences of the five senses, the mood,
  and the sentiments at the moment, I try my best to restore and translate into English
  what I feel in the Chinese poem. The title, “impromptu verses,” is translated from
  <span lang="zh">即事</span>, which adds a little “musicality” into the simple action
  of “jotting down things.” Since my goal is to evoke the reader’s sensations and
  sentiments and put them in the precise moment that the poet was experiencing while
  he wrote the poem, I selected words that emphasize colors and smell, such as “smoke
  and flames,” “green,” and “red.” One phrase that I struggled a bit to translate
  was <span lang="zh">蒼茫</span>, which I translated into “vast and boundless” — a
  spatial dimension that accentuates the hollowness and nothingness of the space called
  <span lang="zh">天地</span>, namely the infinite space between the firmament and earth.
  By doing so, the English reader may experience a moment when the light from the
  sunset permeates and gilds everything in the universe, even though the night is
  looming ahead.</p>
abio: <p>Wang Wei (<span lang="zh">王維</span>, 701 – 761) was a poet, painter, and
  government official. He was born during the glorious Tang Dynasty or Prosperous
  Kaiyuan Era (<span lang="zh">開元盛世</span>), under the rule of Tang Xuanzong (Emperor
  Xuanzong of Tang; <span lang="zh">唐玄宗</span>). The poet also witnessed the An Lushan
  Rebellion (<span lang="zh">安史之亂</span>) during his lifetime. The color imagery in
  Wang Wei’s poetry is vivid, almost like a painting. The vivid colors in Wang Wei’s
  poems may suggest that he was inspired by the life-affirming philosophy of Chan
  (<span lang="zh">禪</span>) (the Japanese adaptation of Chan, more widely known to
  the Western audiences as Zen Buddhism). This would explain much of Wang Wei’s ardent
  wishful thinking.</p>
