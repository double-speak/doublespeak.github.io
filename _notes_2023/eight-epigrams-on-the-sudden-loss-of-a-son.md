poem: "אֶצְעַק בְּמָרָה עַל-גְּזוֹר נַפְשִׁי פִּתְאֹם בְּשַׁחַק נִתְכְּנוּ בָתָּיו\nצַר-לִי
  מְאֹד עָלָיו וּמִי-יִתֵּן מוּתִי אֲנִי הַיּוֹם בְּנִי תַּחְתָּיו\n\n\n\nיָצָא לְבָבִי
  בַּחֲזוֹת יַעְקֹב מֵת עַל-זרֹעוֹת נֹשְׂאָיו רָכָב\nלֹא נֶחֱזוּ בִלְתָּם עֲלֵי תֵבֵל
  אִישִׁים בְּעָפָר קָבְרוּ כוֹכָב \n\n\n\n\nכַּמַּה אֲנִי סֹעֵד לְבָבִי עַד יִשְׁקֹט
  מְעַט עָלַי וְיִתְרַפֵּק\nעָלָיו יְמִינִי אֶתְּנָה אוּלַי יִשְׁלֶה וְלֹא אוּכַל
  לְהִתְאַפֵּק\n\n\n\nדְּמָעַי יִגְּרוּ מֵחֹם לְבָבִי אֲשֶׁר נִקרַע שְּׁנֵים עָשָׂר
  קְרָעִים\nוְחֹק מֵאֵין דֳּמִי תָמִיד לְבַכּוֹת לְבֵן יַקִּיר וְיֶלֶד שַׁעֲשׁוּעִים\n\n\n\nאֵיךְ
  יַעֲמֹד לִבִּי וְאֶמְצָא עַל תֵּבֵל יְמוֹתַי אַחֲרָיו נֹפֶש\nאוֹ אֵיךְ אֱהִי מַבְלִיג
  בְּלִי פָנָיו וּשְׁמוֹ וְזִכְרוֹ תַּאֲוַת נָפֶשׁ\n\n\nשֵׁם יַעֲקֹב אָבַד וְאַךְ
  נֶטַע שֹדוֹ בְּכִלְיוֹתַי מְאֹד יִדְגֶּה\nאֶבְכֶּה לְהַכְחִידוֹ וְיֹסִיף כִּי נֶטַע
  בְּהַשְׁקֹתוֹ מְאֹד יִשְׂגֶּה\n\n\n\nאֱמֶת תֵּבֵל כְּחוֹתָם צַר לְפָנַי וְכַכֶּלֶא
  בְּעֵינַי בֵּית מְגוּרָי\nוְלֹא-אִירָא זְמָן לָעַד לְמַעַן לְמוֹתֶךָ בְּנִי חָלוּ
  מְגוּרָי\n\n\n\nיוֹם בּוֹ נִפְקַד יַעְקֹב אָז קוֹל כִּנּוֹרִי אֶל אֵבֶל הוּמָר\nהַיּוֹם
  הַהוּא יִקַּח אֹפֶל גַּם-יֹאבַד יוֹם הָרַע וָמָר\n\n"
transpoem: |
  I shriek in anguish for the boy severed from my soul—
  Suddenly his home is in the expanse
  I am in great pain for him —
  — Please, just let me take me his place —

  My heart left me when I saw Jacob, dead,
  Carried upon his bearers’ arms.
  On this earth, other than they,
  None have been seen
  Burying a star in the dust.

  I brace my heart again and again,
  That it might quiet down and settle in place.
  My right hand is upon it. Perhaps it will slacken,
  But then I won’t hold back.

  Tears stream from my searing heart,
  Which has been rent twelvefold.
  Now I must weep unrestrained
  For my precious son, my beloved child.

  How can my heart last — so I find rest — in my life
  — after him — on this earth?
  And how can I find comfort without his face,
  When his name and memory are all I desire?
  Jacob’s name is lost — and yet
  A sprout of his loss still thrives inside.
  I try to weep it away, and yet it grows —
  For a sprout flourishes when quenched.

  True, to me, the Earth is like a tight stopper.
  To my eyes, my house is like a prison.
  But I will never fear Fate again, for
  In your death, my son, every fear came to pass.

  On the day Jacob was taken,
  The sound of my harp turned to mourning.
  May that day seize darkness!
  May that evil, bitter day be lost!
note: |
  <p>These eight Hebrew epigrams are about the death of Moses Ibn Ezra’s son, or sons. The order of their composition is unknown, and it is unclear if they are about one or multiple losses. I decided to arrange these translations in a way that narrates a journey through grief after the death of a child. I placed the first poem about sudden loss in the beginning, and then followed it with the epigram about attending the son’s funeral. The next four epigrams portray a parent inundated with intense waves of emotion released by weeping. The final two epigrams convey a sense of deep sorrow whose rawness has subsided due to the passage of time.</p>
  <p>The spare, compact, and sometimes obscure Hebrew makes these poems difficult to translate. The verses are laden with biblical references, difficult constructions, and experiments with language. Like other Hebrew Andalusi poets, Moses Ibn Ezra’s verse was written in the style of medieval Arabic poetry. I needed to consult a number of resources, including a scholarly commentary, a range of Hebrew and Arabic dictionaries, and of course the Hebrew Bible.</p>
  <p>The wordplay at the end of each epigram is almost completely lost in translation. In the original Hebrew, the differences in meanings and syntactical shifts induce a sense of surprise at a radical change. I believe that this effect mirrors the horrible sense of shock and disbelief when hearing of a relative’s sudden death. I tried to arrange these translations in a way that captures this cataclysmic paradigm shift.</p>
  <p>I would like to thank my colleague and friend Ori Kinberg, a doctoral student in Hebrew literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, whose comments on my translations were indispensable.</p>
abio: "<p>Medieval Hebrew poetry in al-Andalus (Islamic Spain) from the eleventh and
  twelfth centuries is an exciting fusion of biblical language and Arabic literary
  style. Moses Ibn Ezra (c. 1055-after 1138) was the third of the four great medieval
  Hebrew poets during that time. After coming of age among the Jews under the Zirid
  dynasty in Granada, he received a rabbinic education in the yeshiva (house of Jewish
  study) in Lucena. Like his educated contemporaries, he wrote both secular and liturgical
  poetry. In his secular poetry, Ibn Ezra is considered the most conservative of the
  medieval Hebrew poets because of his strict adherence to Arabic literary conventions.
  In his youth, he composed the <em>Sefer ha-’Anaq</em> (<em>Book of the Necklace</em>),
  a work of epigrams which demonstrates his mastery of the <em>badī’</em>, or classical
  Arabic poetic ornamentation. His <em>Dīwan</em> (poetry collection) contains many
  genres of medieval Hebrew verse, including wine, panegyric, complaint, love and
  friendship, and contemplation. After the Berber Almoravid conquest of al-Andalus
  in1090, Moses Ibn Ezra fled the kingdom of Granada and wandered in exile in Christian-ruled
  Northern Spain. There he wrote two Judeo-Arabic works, one on the use of biblical
  metaphor, and the other on Hebrew poetics.</p>"

  <p>Ben Notis is a doctoral student in the University of Pennsylvania’s department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations. His dissertation focuses on Hebrew poetry written during an exciting time of Jewish-Muslim interaction in al-Andalus (Islamic Spain) in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. He hopes to explore lyrical complaints about physical and mental breakdowns, betrayal and abuse, separation from friends and lovers, and the vicissitudes of Time. His other interests include medieval Arabic poetry, the histories of madness and emotions, and the cultural history of the human body. A graduate of Brandeis’s Near Eastern and Judaic Studies department in 2017, he came to Penn after a series of odd jobs including farming, Bar Mitzvah tutoring, and book editing. When not studying, he enjoys visiting his nephews and baking.
