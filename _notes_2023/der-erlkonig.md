title: Der Erlkönig
transtitle: The Elm-King
author: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
translator: Benjamin McAvoy-Bickford
poem: |-
  Wer reitet so spät durch Nacht und Wind?
  Es ist der Vater mit seinem Kind:
  Er hat den Knaben wohl in dem Arm,
  Er fasst ihn sicher, er hält ihn warm.

  »Mein Sohn, was birgst du so bang dein Gesicht?«
  »Siehst, Vater, du den Erlkönig nicht?
  Den Erlenkönig mit Kron’ und Schweif?«
  »Mein Sohn, es ist ein Nebelstreif.«

  »Du liebes Kind, komm, geh mit mir!
  Gar schöne Spiele spiel’ ich mit dir;
  Manch’ bunte Blumen sind an dem Strand,
  Meine Mutter hat manch gülden Gewand.«

  »Mein Vater, mein Vater, und hörest du nicht,
  Was Erlenkönig mir leise verspricht?«
  »Sei ruhig, bleibe ruhig, mein Kind:
  In dürren Blättern säuselt der Wind.«

  »Willst, feiner Knabe, du mit mir gehn?
  Meine Töchter sollen dich warten schön;
  Meine Töchter führen den nächtlichen Reihn
  Und wiegen und tanzen und singen dich ein.«

  »Mein Vater, mein Vater, und siehst du nicht dort
  Erlkönigs Töchter am düstern Ort?«
  »Mein Sohn, mein Sohn, ich seh es genau:
  Es scheinen die alten Weiden so grau.«

  »Ich liebe dich, mich reizt deine schöne Gestalt;
  Und bist du nicht willig, so brauch ich Gewalt.«
  »Mein Vater, mein Vater, jetzt fasst er mich an!
  Erlkönig hat mir ein Leids getan!«

  Dem Vater grauset’s, er reitet geschwind,
  Er hält in Armen das ächzende Kind,
  Erreicht den Hof mit Mühe und Not:
  In seinen Armen das Kind war tot.
transpoem: "Who rides so late through night and wind?\nThe father with his lad: \nHe
  has the young one in his arms,\nHe keeps him safe, well-clad.\n\n“My son, what brings
  your look to fear?”\n“You can’t see the Elm-King?\nThe Elm-King with his crown and
  tail?”\n“My son, the mists just sing.”\n\n“Beloved lad, come, go with me!\nThe games
  we’ll nicely play;\nSo many flowers on my shore,\nAnd mother’s gold array.”\n\n“My
  father, father, don’t you hear,\nThe Elm-King’s quiet deals?”\n“Be calm, stay calm,
  my lad: it’s just\nDry leaves the wind reveals.”\n\n“You want, young sir, to go
  with me?\nMy daughters wait there nigh;\nMy daughters lead the nightly waltz,\nAnd
  dance a lullaby.”\n\n“My father, father, don’t you see,\nHis daughters’ dark display?”\n“My
  son, my son, well can I see,\nSome willows old and gray.”\n\n“I love your figure,
  teasing me,\nYou’ll see how I am strong.”\n“My father, father, feel his touch!\nThe
  Elm-King does me wrong!”\n\nThe father, dreading, swiftly rides,\nHe holds his groaning
  son,\nAt last in need he reaches home:\nHis child’s life is done.\n"
note: "<p>“Der Erlkönig” has become one of Goethe’s most famous poems because it lends
  itself well to musical settings, of which one by Franz Schubert has become the most
  well-known. However, its long history of musical settings stretches from the first
  setting, by the actress, musician, and singer Corona Schröter, to Carl Loewe’s popular
  version, to more recent works such as Marc-André Hamelin’s “Étude No. 8 in B-Flat
  Minor”, “Erlkönig, after Goethe”. “Earl King” by the Carolina Chocolate Drops also
  deserves note as a recent, and quite good, musical reworking of this scene. Some
  of the reasons that this poem calls out to musicians is in its strong sense of rhyme
  and a continual forward movement of the action, which I attempted to imitate in
  my English rendering by setting it to one of the meters typical of a ballad.</p> \n
  \        \n<p>Furthermore, this suits the history of the poem; Goethe was inspired
  by the Danish ballad “Elveskud”, also called “Elverskud” and an interpretation of
  the ballad by Johann Gottfried Herder, the second poem translated here. The title
  of  “Erlkönigs Tochter”, or “Elm-King’s Daughter”, seems more common to me than
  the alternate title of “Herr Oluf.” The Herder poem has a similar musicality, since
  it was only lightly adapted from the original source material in the process of
  translation. I chose to render it in a different meter common among ballads and
  hymns that better suited the rhythm of its lines.</p> \n        <p>However, Herder’s
  translation differs significantly from the source text in one way: It discusses
  the “Erlkönig”, or alder-king, instead of the elf-king found in the earlier Danish
  ballad. Although a common approach in English is to simply render “Erlkönig” as
  erl-king, I found this unsatisfying because it destroys the history and meaning
  of the original. Three things, to me, are important about the “Erl” in “Erlkönig”:
  The way it sounds, its meaning of referring to an alder, and how it was supposed
  to initially refer to elves. I found that a translation of elm-king preserved the
  sound symbolism, connected it with trees, and resembled the word elf-king.</p> \n
  \        \n<p>I also sought to preserve the different but interlinked feels of the
  two poems. Goethe’s version takes its time elucidating every line, but the poem
  progresses quickly and straightforwardly to the inevitable end. The lines of Herder
  do not force the reader to slow down as much, but instead the poem circles back
  again and again with its chorus. Ultimately, I decided to balance the need to preserve
  that character with the limits of a literal translation. The translation that I
  settled on isn’t wholly literal but tries to be literal when possible and strictly
  abides by line divisions. I also left some archaisms that seemed to want to sneak
  into the Herder poem stand, which helped preserve its folk-esque origins while giving
  me additional freedom to stick to my self-imposed metrical scheme.</p>"
abio: "<p>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749 – 1832) is arguably the most famous author
  to ever make use of the German language. Besides his poetry, he served as an adviser
  in the Weimar Court and wrote numerous novels, plays, scientific works, and articles.
  Although he can’t neatly be grouped into any one literary movement, he was influenced
  by the Sturm und Drang movement early on in his career and was a major influence
  on burgeoning German Romanticism. Goethe also studied the Quran and Islamic literature
  more generally, an influence demonstrated in his “West-östlicher Divan.” Goethe’s
  esteem in Germanic literary culture is so high that the government-supported foundation
  for the German language abroad is called the Goethe-Institut.\n</p>        \n\n<p>Johann
  Gottfried von Herder (1744 –1803) was a friend of Goethe, although their relationship
  did not last. He became a notable poet and critic in his own right, and was also
  supported by the work of the Weimar Court. Similarly to Goethe, his work is influenced
  by both the neoclassical style of Weimar and the Sturm und Drang movement. His views
  helped give rise to later German nationalistic movements, although he was also a
  supporter of the French Revolution and generally expressed complex and sometimes
  confusing views on political matters.</p>"
