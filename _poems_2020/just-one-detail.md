title: Solo un detalle
transtitle: Just one detail
author: Karina García Albadiz
translator: Ella Konefal
poem: 'Sépanlo bien: no se aprende ni se enseña a escribir. No se enseña nada. Se
  aprende y se enseña a vivir, por eso, escribir es solo un detalle de un vivir anécdota
  de lo escrito. Solo hicimios lo que había que hacer. Subimos buscando el bosque
  porque la vida es fruta y el mañana es agua ante la lengua ojo que en-calla en los
  silencios bien guardados. Sí tal cual con todos los títulos que tengo, me sigo muriendo
  de hambre, ¿iremos realmente a barrer calles?, ¿será eso lo hay que hacer?, ¿esto
  era la vida: buscar algo que no nos aburriera, soportar miles de tonteras o perder
  el tiempo hasta el cansancio?, ¿eso era? Seguimos siendo felices con lo mismo: imágenes
  mientras la realidad nos sigue matando. ¿Ahora es peor o antes? No sé. Crecimos,
  escribo. Me muero aquí. Cambié Derecho por las Letras. Sin tener conciencia todavía,
  cambié el dinero por ser pobre y una clase social por otra. No soy eficiente, no
  pongo límites a mis conversaciones, llego tarde a todos lados, tengo la casa revuelta
  de tanto papel, hago clases entremedio para sobrevivir, sobre todo, anímicamente.
  Mi pasado está lleno y en calma ante un presente y un futuro fuertemente condicionado,
  precario y tumultuoso. ¿Es culpa o no es culpa mía? Sé que nos muelen a palos. Solo
  hice que algunas cosas pasaran.

transpoem: 'Know this: you do not learn nor do you teach writing. You don''t teach
  anything. You learn and you teach living, and as such, writing is just one detail
  within a living anecdotal to the written. We only did what had to be done. We climbed
  in search of the forest because life is fruit and tomorrow is water at the tip of
  the tongue, look out, it drowns    in well-kept silence. If even with all the degrees
  I have, I''m still dying of hunger: Will we really go and sweep the streets? Is
  that what has to be done? Is this life: searching for something that will not bore
  us,  with-standing boundless bullshit or wasting time until exhaustion? Is that
  what it was? We stay happy with the same: images, while reality kills. Is now worse
  or before? I don''t know. We grow, I write. I''ll die here. I traded Law for Letters.
  Without yet knowing it, I traded money for poverty and one class for another. I''m
  not efficient, I don''t put limits on my conversations, I''m always late, my home
  is a whirlwind of paper, I teach classes here and there to survive, above all, energetically.
  My past is full and calm against a present and a future acutely conditional, precarious
  and tumultuous. Is it my fault or is it not? I know they''ll grind us down to sticks.
  All I did was make a few things happen.'
note: "<p>Karina García Albadiz writes with an urgency that does not waste time. Her
  prose is beautiful in that it has force. It is not decorative. In Spanish, this
  passage reads like a quick-moving stream: wide enough to make you nervous, consistently
  turbulent, emphatically directional. There are several efficient and elegant moments
  of parallel meaning. One, in the fifth sentence, is a dense knot: “el mañana es
  agua ante la lengua ojo que en-calla en los silencios bien guardados.” <em>Ojo</em>,
  as a command, means “look out!” And <em>ojo de agua</em> is a “spring” or a “watering
  hole,” the focal point of oasis. For me, <em>agua</em> and <em>ojo</em> reach towards
  each other across the phrase and vibrate between those two gestures: towards alarm
  and towards paradise. <em>Encallar</em> means “to run aground” or “to crash-land,”
  the verbal aftermath of a shipwreck. <em>Callar</em> means “to shut up.” The hyphenation
  of <em>en-callarse</em> conjures silence that is wreckage. A silencing that demolishes
  form, that doesn't even have an aftermath. That destruction of narrative or meaning
  is caused by <em>silencios bien guardados</em>, “well-kept silences.” After the
  interpretive whirlpool of this winding sentence, Albadiz’s language is more direct.
  Towards the end of the passage, I focused on conveying pace and existential urgency.
  Right now, Chile is in the midst of popular uprising and retaliatory crackdown over
  issues of extreme economic inequality and state repression. I read and write with
  this in mind. These words were published seven years ago. To my ears, in this moment,
  they call out a steady, pulsing beat towards insurrection.</p>"
abio: "<p>Karina García Albadiz was born in Valparaíso, Chile, in 1969. She holds
  degrees in Spanish and Interdisciplinary Humanities. Albadiz co-founded and now
  directs the <em>Centro de Investigaciones Poéticas Grupo Casa Azul</em>, the Blue
  House Center for Poetic Research, in Valparaíso, Chile. She also edits two magazines:
  <em>Anáfora</em> (<em>Anaphora</em>) and <em>Botella del Náufrago</em>, which literally
  translates to “shipwreck bottle,” the bottle that carries a note to shore. “Solo
  un detalle” can be found on page 32 of a slim book of prose called <em>¿Dónde está
  la nuez para la Ardilla?</em> (<em>Where is the nut for the squirrel?</em>), published
  in 2013.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Ella Konefal is an artist who takes translation as conceptual grounding
  for her interdisciplinary practice. She was born and partially raised on unceded
  Lenape land along the mid-Atlantic seaboard of present-day USA. She asserts that
  like the labor or attunement of drawing and the labor or attunement of reading something
  for the second time, translation is a form of prayer. It moves something. Where
  that movement leads is as of yet unknown.</p>"
