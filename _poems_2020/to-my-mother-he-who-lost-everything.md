title: A ma mère
transtitle: To My Mother
author: David Diop
translator: Samantha DeStefano
poem: "Quand autour de moi surgissent les souvenirs\nSouvenirs d’escales anxieuses
  au bord du gouffre\nDe mers glacées où se noient les moissons\nQuand revivent en
  moi les jours à la dérive\nLes jours en lambeaux à goût narcotique\nOù derrière
  les volets clos\nLe mot se fait aristocrate pour enlacer le vide\nAlors mère je
  pense à toi\nA tes belles paupières brûlées par les années\nA ton sourire sur mes
  nuits d’hôpital\nTon sourire qui disait les vieilles misères vaincues\nO mère mienne
  et qui est celle de tous\nDu nègre qu’on aveugla et qui revoit les fleurs\nÉcoute
  écoute ta voix\nElle est ce cri traversé de violence\nElle est ce chant guidé seul
  par l’amour.\n\n<h2>Celui qui a tout perdu</h2>\n\nLe soleil brillait dans ma case\nEt
  mes femmes étaient belles et souples\nComme les palmiers sous la brise des soirs\nMes
  enfants glissaient sur le grand fleuve\nAux profondeurs de mort\nEt mes pirogues
  luttaient avec les crocodiles\nLa lune, maternelle, accompagnait nos danses\nLe
  rythme frénétique et lourd du tam-tam\nTam-tam de la Joie Tam-tam de l’Insouciance\nAu
  milieu des feux de liberté.\n\nPuis un jour, le Silence…\nLes rayons du soleil semblèrent
  s’éteindre   \nDans ma case vide de sens\nMes femmes écrasèrent leurs bouches rougies
  \  \nSur les lèvres minces et dures des conquérants aux yeux d’acier\nEt mes enfants
  quittèrent leur nudité paisible\nPour l’uniforme de fer et de sang\nVotre voix s’est
  éteinte aussi\nLes fers de l’esclavage ont déchiré mon coeur\nTams-tams de mes nuits,
  tam-tams de mes pères.\n"
transpoem: |-
  When memories loom up around me
  Memories of anxious stopovers on the edge of the abyss
  Of icy seas where harvests drown
  When the days adrift come to life again in me
  The tattered days with a narcotic taste
  When behind the closed shutters
  The word makes itself an aristocrat to embrace the void
  Then mother I think of you
  Of your beautiful eyelids burned by the years
  Of your smile over my hospital nights
  Your smile that spoke of the old vanquished miseries
  O mother mine and who is mother of all
  Of the Black man whom everyone blinded and who sees the flowers again
  Listen listen to your voice
  It is this shout traversed by violence
  It is this song guided only by love.

  <h2>He Who Lost Everything</h2>

  The sun shone in my hut
  And my women were beautiful and supple
  Like palm trees beneath the evening breeze
  My children slid on the great river
  To the depths of death
  And my canoes fought with the crocodiles
  The moon, maternal, accompanied our dances
  The tom-tom drum’s frantic and heavy rhythm
  Tom-Tom of Joy Tom-Tom of Innocence
  Among the fires of liberty.

  Then one day, Silence…
  The sun’s rays seemed to go out
  In my hut empty of meaning
  My women crushed their reddened mouths
  On the hard thin lips of steel-eyed conquerors
  And my children abandoned their peaceful nudity
  For the uniform of iron and blood
  Your voice went out too
  The irons of slavery tore up my heart
  Tom-toms of my nights, tom-toms of my fathers.

  <p>After his father’s death when he was eight years old, David Diop was raised by his mother, who often told him positive stories about Africa and taught him pride in Black culture to combat the racism they faced in France. Diop was limited by lifelong leg and lung disabilities that prevented him from completing his medical degree at the University of Montpellier. This poem is about his mother watching over his frequent hospitalizations and personifies Africa as a nurturing mother.</p>
  <p>Other translators render <em>on aveugla</em> as “they blind” or in the passive voice as “is blinded.” However, I literally translated <em>on</em> as “one, everyone” to make it clear that Africans were actively and universally oppressed under French colonial rule. Similarly, I translated “Le mot se fait aristocrate” as “the word makes itself an aristocrat.” Unlike other translators’ “becomes” or “turns,” my literal translation of <em>se fait</em> as “makes itself” more clearly conveys Diop’s proud emphasis on African self-creation and agency.</p>
  <p>I translated <em>surgissent</em> as “loom up” instead of “arise, appear” to create a tense mood in the opening line. I translated <em>cri</em> not as “cry” but as the more forceful, urgent “shout” to complement the previous line’s reference to the violence inflicted on colonized Africans and the violent resistance that Diop endorsed. I literally translated <em>elle est ce</em> as “it is this” instead of others’ “this is the” to equate the mother’s voice, Diop’s poem, and his plan for achieving African independence with a combination of revolt and love for tradition.</p>
  <p>In “He Who Lost Everything,” David Diop’s language and images are simpler than his description of a vibrant, life-giving woman in “To My Mother.” While Diop celebrates African traditions in the latter poem, this antislavery poem mourns their destruction.</p>
  <p>In <em>Hammer Blows and Other Writings</em>, translators Simon Mpondo and Frank Jones call this poem “Loser of Everything.” However, I think that the negative connotation of “loser” makes the anticolonial rebellion and African pride that Diop endorsed seem more difficult to achieve. I translated the title literally as “He Who Lost Everything” to make clear that the speaker’s worth is not defined by his loss and to emphasize the act of oppression instead.</p>
  <p>The simple language in the first stanza allows Diop to evoke the peaceful, uncomplicated nature of life in Africa before colonial rule. In the second stanza, the same simplicity conveys the swift brutality of the violence of colonization. The last three lines form a sparse but powerful lament that connects the speaker to two aspects of his lost community — the intimacy of “your voice” and “my heart” and the ancestral traditions of “my fathers” — and names the institution of slavery that destroyed them both.</p>
  <p>I strove to preserve Diop’s effective directness. <em>Insouciance</em> is the French equivalent of the English word “insouciance,” which means “lighthearted unconcern, nonchalance, carefree attitude,” but I wanted to use a more common English word to keep the language of my translation as simple as Diop’s French. I decided to translate <em>insouciance</em> as “innocence” to convey the lightheartedness of <em>insouciance</em> and of precolonial African life without complicating the poem with a two-word translation like Mpondo and Jones’ “carefree life.” Conversely, Mpondo and Jones translate <em>belle et souple</em> as “lovely and lissome” rather than the literal “beautiful and supple,” not only giving the phrase artificially elevated diction but also adding alliteration that Diop did not intend.</p>
abio: "<p>David Diop was born to a Senegalese father (a cousin of Léopold Sédar Senghor)
  and a Cameroonian mother in 1927 in Bordeaux, France. Throughout his life, he divided
  his time between West Africa and France. He was a radical voice of Négritude, a
  twentieth-century Francophone African and Caribbean literary movement that was inspired
  by the Harlem Renaissance and Black poets such as Langston Hughes. The movement
  sought to promote pride in a rich Black culture as a reaction against oppressive
  French colonial rule. Diop’s protest poetry is more militant than that of African
  poets like Senghor. His writings display a commitment to African liberation and
  revolt against colonialism found in the work of Caribbean poets like Aimé Césaire.
  Diop contributed poems to <em>Présence Africaine</em> (<em>African Presence</em>),
  an influential Parisian political and literary magazine of the African diaspora.
  In 1956, he published his only book, <em>Coups de pilon</em> (<em>Pestle Blows</em>),
  which was translated into English along with additional poems and prose pieces as
  <em>Hammer Blows and Other Writings</em> in 1973. Diop died in a plane crash near
  Dakar, Senegal in 1960, days before Senghor was elected the first president of the
  newly independent nation.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Samantha DeStefano graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> from the University
  of Pennsylvania with a BA in English, a concentration in medieval and Renaissance
  literature, and minors in both classical studies and gender, sexuality, and women’s
  studies. At Penn, she studied Latin, Old English, and Middle English. She has published
  academic research in <em>Transcription Collection</em> and the <em>Journal of the
  Penn Manuscript Collective</em> on a manuscript of <em>Poems, 1805–1818</em> by
  John Syng Dorsey, the author of the first American textbook of surgery, for which
  she translated quotations from Latin poetry. She has near-native knowledge of Spanish,
  and after graduation she embarked on three years of intensive study of French.</p>"
