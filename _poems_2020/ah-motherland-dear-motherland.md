author: Shu Ting
translator: Anne Chen
poem: "我是你河边上破旧的⽼老老⽔\n水⻋车， 数百年年来纺着疲\n惫的歌；\n我是你额上熏⿊黑的矿灯，\n照你在历史的隧洞洞⾥里里蜗⾏行行摸索\n我是⼲干瘪的稻穗，是失修的路路\n基；
  是淤滩上的驳船\n把纤绳深深\n勒勒进你的肩膊，\n——祖国啊！\n·\n我是贫困，\n我是悲哀。\n我是你祖祖辈辈\n痛苦的希望啊， \n是“⻜飞天”袖间\n千百年年未落到地⾯面的花朵，\n——祖国啊！\n·\n我是你簇新的理理想，\n刚从神话的蛛⽹网⾥里里挣\n脱；
  我是你雪被下古莲的胚\n芽； 我是你挂着眼泪的笑涡\n；我是新刷出的雪⽩白的起跑线\n； 是绯红的黎明\n正在喷薄；\n—— 祖国啊！\n·\n我是你的⼗十亿分之⼀一，\n是你九百六⼗十万平⽅方的总\n和；
  你以伤痕累累的乳房\n喂养了了\n迷惘的我、深思的我、 沸腾的我； \n那就从我的⾎血⾁肉之躯上\n去取得\n你的富饶、你的荣光、你的⾃自由；\n—— 祖国啊，
  \n我亲爱的祖国！"
transpoem: "I am your battered waterwheel, \nWeaving an ancient weary chime.\nI am
  a smoke-tinted miner’s lamp,\nLighting your drag through the tale of time.\n\nI
  am a rice sprout wrinkled and toasted, \nlost in oblivious lanes.\nI am an untamed
  boat by the coast, \nlashing your shoulders with chains.\n…Ah Motherland!\n\nI am
  poverty \nI am grief\nI am the ache within your hope \nyour posterity yet ancestry.\nI
  am born in utopian land,\nwhere million-year-old petals \nrefuse to drop from trees.\n…Ah
  Motherland!\n\nI am your ideals fresh and wild,\nRescued from cobwebs you have fabled.\nI
  am the lotus rooted beneath snow, \nMelting to tears in smiling dimples.\n\nI am
  a white starting line \nfreshly traced\nagainst scarlet dawn, \nbeaming gold rays.\n…Ah
  Motherland!\n\nI am a bit of your billion,\nsumming acres beneath your feet.\nYour
  eroded and beaten breasts have nurtured\na confounded boiling me.\nPlease take my
  name and blood to fuel \nyour prosperity and liberty.\n\nOh Motherland… \nDear Motherland!\n"
note: "<p>I attempted to translate the weary, hopeful, and zealous tone of the poem.
  I chose to use “Ah” in the title to make the poem colloquial, which is a quality
  present in many of Shu Ting’s poems. Also, I translated the line “ache within your
  hope” to portray the bitterness and frustration presented by the author. The phrase
  “utopian land” in the original is “immortal’s sleeve,” which symbolizes an idealistic
  and happy place. I used “utopian land” to convey the cultural connotation.</p>"

  <p>Shu Ting is one of the most prominent female Chinese poets of the twentieth century. At the age of seventeen, she was sent to work in the countryside during the Cultural
  Revolution. However, this did not stop her pursuit of literature and poetry. In the early 1980s, she was regarded as the leading female representative of the Misty Poets, who reacted against the restrictions on art during the Cultural Revolution. Shu Ting has joined the official Chinese Writers’ Association and won the National Outstanding Poetry Award twice now.</p>
