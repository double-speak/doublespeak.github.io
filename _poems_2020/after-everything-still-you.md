title: Dopo tutto anche tu
transtitle: After everything, still you
author: Alda Merini
translator: Quinn Gruber
poem: "Dopo tutto anche tu\nche dovrei sentire nemico\ne che perdono.\nSei soltanto
  un uomo\nche cerca di capire\ne di non capire nessuno.\nLa tua generosità \nè falsa
  come la mia.\nNessuno di noi\nè talmente buono\nda far sortir\nmiracoli dai versi.\nNessuno
  di noi\nè talmente puro\nda dimenticarli\nper sempre.\n"
transpoem: |
  After everything, still you
  who I should see as an enemy
  and who I forgive.
  You are only a man
  who searches for understanding
  and understands no one.
  Your generosity
  is false, like mine.
  Neither of us
  is good enough
  to spin
  miracles out of verses.
  Neither of us
  is honest enough
  to abandon them
  forever.

  <p>Even after I finished this translation, I struggled to find words to describe what is so captivating about Merini’s poetry. Calling its language simple feels like an injustice to its intense emotional power, and yet the poem’s simplicity is its driving force. Balancing these traits proved itself the most difficult aspect of translating. For example, <em>sentire</em> possesses many meanings: “to hear, smell, taste, and feel”; multiple forms of sensory perception are implicitly tied to emotional feeling. Thus, <em>sentire nemico</em> not only implies the <em>feeling</em> that someone is your enemy, but also the inability to perceive them as anything else. I translated this phrase as “see as an enemy” to preserve the sense-emotion link as naturally as possible in English.</p>
  <p><em>Far sortir</em> was another difficult phrase; the use of <em>fare</em> (“to do, to make”) before an infinitive is a common construction in Italian but can sound jarring in English, so I only translated <em>sortir</em>. <em>Sortir(e)</em> means “to pull from, draw out,” but I chose to translate it as “spin,” in the sense of spinning yarn or thread, to evoke a physical connection, the weaving together of two people’s lives.</p>
  <p>Overall, I wanted to capture the conversational sound of the poem — not in the sense of small talk, but of openness. The speaker recognizes the pain of the past that lies between them and the man, and yet they forgive him. They do not dismiss that pain, but reach out despite it, because we rely on our relationships with others to know who we are. Though this <em>generosità</em>/generosity is “false” in that we write and speak in order to reassure ourselves, Merini asks us: Is there any other way to survive, to connect with each other, than through language and poetry?</p>
abio: "<p>Alda Merini (Milan, 1931–2009) was one of Italy’s most famous twentieth-century
  poets; her poetry is renowned for its spirituality and emotional intensity. She
  published her first work when she was fifteen and soon gained the admiration of
  other notable Italian poets such as Eugenio Montale and Salvatore Quasimodo. Merini
  wrote over fifty books, some of the most well-known being <em>La Terra Santa</em>
  (<em>Holy Land</em>, 1984) and <em>L’altra verità: diario di una diversa</em> (<em>The
  Other Truth: Diary of a Misfit</em>, 1986). Much of her work reflects upon her experiences
  with mental illness, with which she struggled for her entire life. Her accolades
  include the Premio Librex Montale, the Premio Elsa Morante Ragazzi, and a nomination
  for the Nobel Prize in Literature, among others.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Quinn Gruber (C’22) studies English and Italian Literature at the University
  of Pennsylvania. As a kid, they would sit and read the family copy of the Merriam-Webster
  dictionary, which probably explains why they refuse to use the OED. In their free
  time, they write poetry, play in a quartet, work at the Kelly Writers House, and
  go on long walks. If you have a spare copy of an Italian dictionary, let them know.</p>"
