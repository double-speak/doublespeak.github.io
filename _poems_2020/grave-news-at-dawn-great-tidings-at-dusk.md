transtitle: Grave News at Dawn, Great Tidings at Dusk
author: Zhang Ergun
translator: Kejia Wang
poem: |
  天下尚未大黑。初月如钩
  悬挂着红彤彤的人间。 落日把湖水
  沏成一杯普洱的时候
  湖心那厢，有人打着唿哨归来
  堤岸上的垂柳和人群啊
  忍不住颤抖。他们从斑驳的小机船上
  抬下一个湿淋淋的少女
  是的，清晨的噩耗
  是一个少女的溺亡
  而黄昏的捷报
  就是找到她的遗体
transpoem: "the world is not fully dark yet. The waxing moon as if a hook\nhangs the
  vermillion realm of men. When the falling sun \nhas steeped the waters into a cup
  of the finest Pu’Er tea\none returns, with a deliberate whistle, from the heart
  of the lake\nthose weeping willows and spectating souls on the embarkment\ncannot
  help but shake. They carry from the mottled mechanical boat\nthe form of a dripping
  wet young girl\nyes, the grave news at dawn\nwas the drowning of a young girl\nwhile
  the great tidings at dusk\nare the discovery of her body\n"
note: <p>Zhang is not an erudite poet even in the Chinese language, and his poems
  run directly counter to several ideas, trends, and styles that are currently popular
  and celebrated in modern English language poetry. To translate him too directly
  risks the translation likely not being considered a poem at all in English; yet
  to translate him in too cultivated a fashion risks losing the famed sincerity and
  grounded nature of his works. I ended up embellishing several of his more colorful
  images (“the vermillion realm of men,” “spectating souls on the embarkment”) while
  keeping some of his more starkly crude ones (the “dripping wet young girl”). I agonized
  over several words that do not have direct equivalents in English; <span lang="zh">噩耗</span>
  (“grave news”) is typically used to refer to news of death, especially deaths in
  the family, while <span lang="zh">捷报</span> (“great tidings”) is usually used to
  refer to news of victories, especially in the context of war or economic development.
  The original poem’s juxtaposition of these two terms in the title at the end draws
  attention to the false equivalence between “good” and “bad” news — the irony that
  the joy in the successful recovery can somehow offset the pain of a loss of life.
  In maintaining that juxtaposition and choosing terms that I hope have similar connotations
  in English, I hope I have conveyed some of the same sentiments in my translation.</p>

  <p>Zhang Ergun (<span lang="zh">张二棍</span>, lit. “Zhang second stick/rod”) is a Chinese poet from Shanxi province. Born in 1982 to a family of modest means, Zhang attended vocational school for only a year after graduating from middle school. Working as a member of a provincial geologic surveying team, Zhang spent decades of his life traveling in remote areas and living among the poor. His poems are famed for their simplicity, sincerity, social criticism, and compassion for the powerless and the poor. He has published one collection of poems, <span lang="zh">旷野</span> (lit. <em>Open Wilderness</em>), and is now a contracted writer with the Shanxi Academy of Literature.</p>
  <p>Critic and fellow poet Liu Nian (<span lang="zh">刘年</span>) noted that Zhang’s poetry is representative of what he considers to be the “Chinese school” of contemporary Chinese poetry. According to Liu, the school – and Zhang’s works – follows the literary tradition of classical Chinese poetry while drawing inspiration from Western philosophy. Poems from the school feature simple prose, grounded realism, and compassion for all.</p>
