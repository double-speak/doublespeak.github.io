transtitle: A Joy — A Bliss
author: Ruwan Bandujeewa
translator: Chamini Kulathunga
poem: "තවත් එක් පඹයෙක් හදන්නට\nගිහින් එක්කහු වෙනව වෙනුවට \nඋපන් කමතට පොහොර වෙන එක
  \nසැපකි — සතුටකි පිදුරු ගසකට"
transpoem: |-
  Rather than joining in creating
  yet another scarecrow
  decaying into the homefield
  is a joy — a bliss to a stick of straw
note: |-
  <p>The four poems hand-picked for this submission are from a collection I am currently translating from my native language of Sinhalese, one of the official languages in Sri Lanka. The selection of poems weaves together metaphors from a pastoral, agricultural Sri Lankan setting unique to Bandujeewa’s poetry. In my English translations of these poems, I wanted to preserve the simple, pastoral elegance in Bandujeewa’s choice of language. I also attempted to preserve in English the melody produced through the simple, colloquial language Bandujeewa uses, which contrasts the conventional literary high variety of the diglossic Sinhalese.</p>
  <p>One of the main strategies I adopted to bring the aforementioned qualities into English was the use of internal rhymes. I tried to produce music in English in places where the original poem flowed melodiously. End rhymes were also used when and where necessary, although I did not consciously try to employ them. I attempted to remain as close to the original word order as possible without, of course, distorting the meaning and language of the poem in English; I used anastrophe where applicable.</p>
  <p>I believe that this selection of poems is capable of evoking, in its raw and pastoral essence, a sense of nostalgia, pain, and loneliness that blends with a feeling of comradery. Therefore, the poems highlight the existential bond between humans and nature, a controversial idea today among lovers of both.</p>
abio: "<p>Ruwan Bandujeewa is a contemporary poet loved by many Sri Lankan readers
  of poetry. One can argue that his subject matter has communist undertones, but in
  fact his perspective on the often-neglected masses is very much intrinsic to the
  fabric of Sri Lankan politics and, in a sense, to the world at large. While he draws
  most of his imagery from nature and local agricultural settings, <em>simple</em>,
  <em>beautiful</em>, <em>honest</em>, and <em>melodic</em> motifs are characteristic
  of Bandujeewa’s poetic diction.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Chamini Kulathunga is a translator from Sri Lanka working with contemporary
  Sri Lankan Sinhalese literature. She is a second year MFA candidate in literary
  translation at University of Iowa’s Translation Workshop. She was a visiting fellow
  at Cornell University’s South Asia Program in the summer of 2019, and is the blog
  editor and a member of the editorial board of <em>Exchanges: Journal of Literary
  Translation</em>.</p>"
