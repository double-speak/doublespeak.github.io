author: Alejandra Pizarnik
translator: Maria Lourdes Riillo
poem: "Mañana\nme vestirán con cenizas al alba,\nme llenarán la boca de flores.\nAprenderé
  a dormir\nen la memoria de un muro,\nen la respiración de un animal que sueña.\n\n<h2>El
  Deseo de La Palabra</h2>\n\nLa noche, de nuevo la noche, la magistral sapiencia
  de lo oscuro, el cálido roce de la muerte, un \ninstante de éxtasis para mí, heredera
  de todo jardín prohibido.\n\nPasos y voces del lado sombrío del jardín. Risas en
  el interior de las paredes. No vayas a creer que están vivos. No vayas a creer \nque
  no están vivos. En cualquier momento la fisura en la pared \ny el súbito desbandarse
  de las niñas que fui.\n\nCaen niñas de papel de variados colores. ¿Hablan los colores?
  ¿Hablan las imágenes de papel?\nSolamente hablan las doradas y de ésas no hay ninguna
  por aquí.\n\nVoy entre muros que se acercan, que se juntan. Toda la noche hasta
  la aurora salmodiaba: <em>Si no \nvino es porque no vino.</em> Pregunto. ¿A quién?
  Dice que pregunta, quiere saber a quién pregunta. \nTú ya no hablas con nadie. Extranjera
  a muerte está muriéndose. Otro es el lenguaje de los \nagonizantes.\n\nHe malgastado
  el don de transfigurar a los prohibidos (los siento respirar adentro de las paredes).
  \nImposible narrar mi día, mi vía. Pero contempla absolutamente sola la desnudes
  de estos muros. \nNinguna flor crece ni crecerá del milagro. A pan y agua toda la
  vida."
transpoem: "Tomorrow\nthey will dress me with ashes at daybreak,\nthey will stuff
  my face with flowers.\nI will learn to sleep\nwith the memory of a mural,\nin the
  steady breath\nof a dreaming beast.\n\n<h2>A Word’s Wish</h2>\n \nNight, again the
  night, the ruling wisdom of darkness, the kindled caress of death, an instant of
  \necstasy for me, heir of all forbidden garden. \n \nFootsteps and voices from the
  somber side of the garden. Giggles inside the walls. \nDon’t you dare believe they
  live. Don’t you dare believe that they do not live. At any moment, a \nfissure in
  the wall and the sudden release of the little girls that I was. \n \nPaper girls
  of different colors fall. Do colors speak? Do paper images speak? Only the gold
  ones \ndo and there are none of those around here.\n \nI go between walls that come
  together, that join. All night long chanting: <em>If she didn’t come it’s \nbecause
  she didn’t come.</em> I ask. Whom? Say she asks, wanting to know who she’s asking.
  You \ndon’t talk with anyone anymore. Death’s stranger is dying. The dying speak
  a different \nlanguage. \n\nI’ve wasted my gift for transforming the forbidden (I
  sense them breathing in the walls). It’s \nimpossible to narrate my life, my way.
  But I contemplate absolutely, solely the undressing of \nthese walls. No future
  here for miracle flowers. Only a life on bread and water.\n\n"

  <p>“Shadow of the Coming Days” is dedicated to Ivonne A. Bordelois, an Argentine poet, essayist, and friend of Pizarnik. The two frequently exchanged correspondence. The poem reflects not a resignation, but an acceptance of the transfiguration of the body and mind, a reflection of days to come. To translate this poem, I began with a literal translation, then meditated on specific words. The word at the end of the first line, <em>alba</em>, means “sunrise” or “dawn.” I translated it as “daybreak,” however, because “daybreak” reminds me of the Spanish word <em>parto</em>, which means both “break” and “labor (birth).” I enjoyed the juxtaposition “daybreak” contributes to in “They will dress me with ashes at daybreak.” Also, instead using the literal translation of <em>muro</em>, which is “wall,” I settled on “mural.” I think that a memory of a mural is still a wall, but a wall with a vivid painting on it is potentially a haunting memory. I had trouble with the second-to-last line specifically because I wanted to preserve its stops and silences. Its literal translation is “in the respiration.” I preserved the “in,” and changed “respiration” to “steady breath.” As for the last line, “beast” is more mystical and threatening than “animal,” which I thought would mesh better with the word “dreaming” and the dreamlike quality of the poem.</p>
  <p>“A Word’s Wish” is incredibly disorienting in the original Spanish, and unlike anything I have ever read. As with “Shadow of Days to Come,” I wanted to preserve the unsettling feeling in the English translation. Pizarnik wrote many poems about the night. She often stayed up late, writing endlessly. This poem is a journey back into the night, where she contemplates who she was as a little girl and whether that girl ever even existed. The second and fourth stanzas were the most challenging for me to translate. The Spanish is not grammatically correct in the second stanza of the original poem, so it was difficult to translate while preserving the uniqueness of the original. Further, the last line of the second stanza is particularly interesting because it is not a straightforward sentence. A literal translation is “at any moment, the fissure in the wall and the sudden undoing of the girls I was.” In order to retain the broken and unclear nature of the sentence, I kept the first half of the sentence and left “girls” plural. Regarding the fourth stanza, it is not gendered in the original poem, but as I was translating, I began to use “she” and it resonated with me. It seems to me that the narrator in the fourth stanza yearns for the little girl that she once was. The little girl is long gone, but her imprint remains. She is so distant, in fact, that she even speaks a different language. Finally, I spent some time on the last sentence because it didn’t have a verb. Literally, the line translates as “to bread and water all life.” I think that at the end, the narrator accepts there will be no miracle, and that she must continue to live satisfied by the simple things, such as bread and water. It’s not defeat, but an acceptance of reality.</p>
abio: "<p>Alejandra Pizarnik (1936–1972) was an Argentine poet, born in Buenos Aires
  to Jewish Russian immigrants. Inspired by the works of Arthur Rimbaud and other
  surrealists, her work has often been described as enigmatic, complex, intimate,
  and haunting. Pizarnik studied Philosophy and Letters at the University of Buenos
  Aires. After graduating, she moved to Paris, France, where she lived between 1960
  and 1964, her most productive time as a poet. In Paris, she translated the works
  of French poets, connected with other prominent writers of the time, and wrote Arbol
  de Diana, a collection of poetry.When she moved back to Buenos Aires, she continued
  to write and published some of her most famous work. Although her life was cut short
  — she died at thirty-six — she had a tremendous impact on the world of modern poetry.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Maria Lourdes Riillo is a senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying
  comparative literature and minoring in creative writing. She was born in Buenos
  Aires, Argentina, and moved to the United States with her family when she was six.
  When she is not at theater rehearsal or in class, she enjoys reading, baking, and
  spending time with her friends. Maria enjoys the musicality and rhythm of poetry
  most of all, and the unique challenge that translating poses in that regard.</p>"
