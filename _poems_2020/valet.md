poem: "Glühendes Sandkorn im Auge,\nden Himmel,\ner saß\nJahre ungezählt\nvor der
  befragten See :\nhohlhallend,\njenseitiges Weiß, die Wellen.\nInnehausend dem Brustkorb\nAntwort:\nder

  Auswurf, kalt.\nSeine Finger darin\nspielten\nmuscheltot mit der Zeit.\nAls ob Zeit\netwas
  ändert,\ndie Wolke.\nSchrumpfend\nein Vogelknochen im Blickkreis (hat\nder Stein
  denn gesungen).\nEr fror,\naufhorchend : oben,\nSpitzmesser in Fels,\nSchaufeln
  gruben\nden Schrei aus der Luft. (Er\nkennt ihn), saß,\nden unerreichten Hohlraum\neng\num
  sich.\n\n                Rücklings\n                die Todesharken aufwärts :\nAntennen,

transpoem: "Glowing sand grain in sight, \nthe sky, \nhe sat \ncountless years \nfacing
  the surveyed sea: \ncavernous, \notherworldly white, the waves. \nWithin the chest\nReply:
  \nthe beach pebbles\nancient tumbling. \n\nBy the black cliff \nwashed aside \nhard-shelled
  ejecta, cold. \nHis fingers within \nplayed \nmussel-dead with time. \nAs if time
  \nchanges something,\nthe cloud. \nShrinking \na bird bone in sight (has \nthe stone
  sung).\nHe froze, \nlistening: above, \nspear in rock, \nshovels dug \nthe scream
  out of the air. (He \nrecognizes it*), sat,\nthe unrivaled void\nenveloping\nhim.\n\n
  \               Backwards \n                the death-rakes upwards: \nantennas,
  sung by \nchildren under the roof \nof the thousand-year-old\n        Eurydice.\n\n
  \       Still\nin front of the hut, wooden \nsilence, he stood, \nwomen, broad-hued
  shadows (he \nbrushes them). \nOn iron rust sand-\nliberated fruits.\nUnder his
  tongue the sea, \nhe ate, \nhe drank \nbitters to the hairy fishermen. \n\nAs in
  the cracked wood late \nthe village \nslept upon death, \n                its veins,
  \nit is said, have in other flesh\nsung, which\nbent — \n        or was it \noutside?
  Wind, \nwhich into the slicing shells \nof the clams\nreached —\n\n*The scream.\n"
note: |-
  <p>Erich Arendt’s works of this period are characterized by the “timelessness of time” and the “spacelessness of space,” and “Valet” is no exception. Arendt pushes the limits of comprehension to an extent where even he, narrating in the third person, is disoriented by his memories.</p>
  <p>The poem is not difficult to translate, with the exception of some nuances. For example, Verrollen implies not only a dull, roaring sound but also the act of thrashing and twisting, and there is no direct translation that preserves the dual meanings. Additionally, while it is clear in German that <em>ihn</em> (“him/it”) in “Er kennt ihn” refers to <em>Schrei</em> (“scream”), clarity is lost when translating because English lacks grammatical gender. It is also important to note that although German sentence structure differs significantly from that of English, there remains room for choice, and I have replicated Arendt’s choices wherever possible.</p>
  <p>Because Arendt’s poetry was an exploration of both the private and political spheres, it is difficult to understand “Valet” without knowledge of his circumstances; translation alone does not alter this requirement. The mention of bird bones, Eurydice, and mussels seem unrelated until one considers Arendt’s frequent visits to Greece, where he sought in mythology and culture a better understanding of his own existence. The keywords “waves,” “cloud,” “sea,” and “wind,” among others, were common throughout his poems and conveyed the idea of the ever-changing personal and political landscapes. Surrealism and ontologic contradictions — the sky reduced to a “grain of sand,” “shovels [digging] / the scream out of the air” — represent Arendt’s rebellion against bourgeois conformism, although it is clear he does not equate artistic freedom (which he nonetheless was continually denied) with social liberation.</p>
abio: "<p>Erich Arendt spent the last three decades of his life a prisoner of the
  German Democratic Republic (GDC), transforming the story of his life into poetry.
  Born in 1903 in Neuruppin, Germany, he first published his poetry in 1925 in Herwarth
  Walden’s expressionist magazine <em>Der Sturm</em>. He joined the Communist Party
  of Germany (KPD) in 1926 and the Association of Proletarian-Revolutionary Authors
  (BPRS) in 1928; however, his works were criticized by BPRS chairman Johannes Becher
  for being too bourgeois, causing Arendt to pause his writings. In 1933, Arendt and
  his half-Jewish wife, Käthe, fled from Nazi Germany to Switzerland, and subsequently
  to Spain in 1934, France in 1939, and Colombia in 1942. In Colombia, he became active
  in anti-Nazi political organizations (the AFNB and the NKFD), wrote his first book,
  and toured the Caribbean; the mention of “hairy fishermen” in “Valet” likely refers
  to the Caribbean fishing village of Tolú and its inhabitants, whose contemplativeness
  and beauty left a deep impression on him. Due to political instability in Colombia
  in the late 1940s, he and his wife returned to East Germany in 1950. Aligning himself
  with reform socialism, he was denied admission to the East German Communist Party
  (SED), was continuously monitored by the Stasi (the state security service for the
  GDC) after 1957, and had his poetry censored. Following the construction of the
  Berlin Wall and the Prague Spring in the 1960s, he increasingly distanced himself
  from the SED regime and found popularity in West Germany. Arendt died in 1984 in
  his home in Wilhelmshorst.</p>"

  German because German is the language of chemistry, which in turn is the language
  of life.</p>"
