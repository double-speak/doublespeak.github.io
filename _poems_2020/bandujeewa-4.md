poem: "“පියතුමනි\nකිමද අප නොයන්නේ \nවප් මගුල් උළෙලට \nරජතුමාත් ඒවි අද කුඹුරට \nහැරපියා
  මේ මුනිවත \nකියා පෑ යුතු නොවෙද ඔබ ඔවුනට\nඅප විසින් \nසාරවත් කල බැව් මේ පස \nපොළෝ
  කුහරය තුල සැඟව හිඳ”\n\n“කුඩා ගැඩවිල් පුත\nඋදලු තලයකට පුරුද්දක් නැත \nහඳුනගෙන\nපස
  සරු කල සහ නොකල උන්ගේ වත \nතව තවත් හාරගෙන\nඅඳුරු මඩ තුළ ගිලී යනු මිස \n ඉහල එළිමහන
  වෙත \nයෑම නුසුදුසුය පුත.”\n\n<h2>සැපකි — සතුටකි</h2> \n\nතවත් එක් පඹයෙක් හදන්නට\nගිහින්
  එක්කහු වෙනව වෙනුවට \nඋපන් කමතට පොහොර වෙන එක \nසැපකි — සතුටකි පිදුරු ගසකට\n\n<h2>ඇළ</h2>\n\nඇළ
  හොඳින් හැඳ පැළඳ \nඇවිද යයි කුඹුරු මැද \n\nවැව අරෙහෙ නිදි නැතිව \nමේ ඇඳුම මහපු බව
  \nකිසිම වී කරලකට \nඇළ කියා නැත තවම\n\n<h2>ගසක් තම මල් අමතා කී කවිය</h2> \n\nගණන්
  කර බැලූ විට \nතවත් මල් කීපයක් \nපිපෙන්නට නියමිතව \nඉතිරි වී ඇති බැවින් \n\nකැමැත්තෙන්
  පර වෙන්න \nකැමති මල් සිටී නම් \nසුළඟ එන්නට කලින් \nවරක් අත් ඔසවන්න"
transpoem: "“Dear father,\nwhy don’t we attend\nthe Ploughing Festival?\nEven the
  king is coming\nto the field today.\nShouldn’t we break this silence\nand announce\nit
  is us\nwho manured this soil\nfrom within the bowels of the earth?”\n   \n“Little
  earthworm son,\na hoe’s blade knows not\nthose who manured the soil\nand those who
  did not.\nTherefore, rising into the open air\nis unadvised.\nDrill your way deeper\nto
  the dark depths of mud.\nDoing otherwise, my son,\nis not wiser.”\n\n<h2>A Joy —
  A Bliss</h2>\r\n\r\nRather than joining in creating\r\nyet another scarecrow\r\ndecaying
  into the homefield\r\nis a joy — a bliss to a stick of straw\n\n<h2>Canal</h2>\r\n\r\nThe
  canal, dressed all fine and dandy\r\nglides across the paddies\r\n\r\nhow the lake
  sewed its garb\r\nover sleepless nights\r\nthe canal hasn’t breathed a word\r\nto
  a single grain of rice\n\n<h2>A Tree to its Flowers</h2>\n\r\nUpon counting\r\nthe
  remaining buds \r\nawaiting to blossom,\r\na tree said\r\nto its flowers\r\n\r\nif
  there be flowers\r\nvolunteering to wilt\r\nraise your hand just once\r\nbefore
  the wind comes"

  <p>The four poems hand-picked for this submission are from a collection I am currently translating from my native language of Sinhalese, one of the official languages in Sri Lanka. The selection of poems weaves together metaphors from a pastoral, agricultural Sri Lankan setting unique to Bandujeewa’s poetry. In my English translations of these poems, I wanted to preserve the simple, pastoral elegance in Bandujeewa’s choice of language. I also attempted to preserve in English the melody produced through the simple, colloquial language Bandujeewa uses, which contrasts the conventional literary high variety of the diglossic Sinhalese.</p>
  <p>One of the main strategies I adopted to bring the aforementioned qualities into English was the use of internal rhymes. I tried to produce music in English in places where the original poem flowed melodiously. End rhymes were also used when and where necessary, although I did not consciously try to employ them. I attempted to remain as close to the original word order as possible without, of course, distorting the meaning and language of the poem in English; I used anastrophe where applicable.</p>
  <p>I believe that this selection of poems is capable of evoking, in its raw and pastoral essence, a sense of nostalgia, pain, and loneliness that blends with a feeling of comradery. Therefore, the poems highlight the existential bond between humans and nature, a controversial idea today among lovers of both.</p>
abio: "<p>Ruwan Bandujeewa is a contemporary poet loved by many Sri Lankan readers
  of poetry. One can argue that his subject matter has communist undertones, but in
  fact his perspective on the often-neglected masses is very much intrinsic to the
  fabric of Sri Lankan politics and, in a sense, to the world at large. While he draws
  most of his imagery from nature and local agricultural settings, <em>simple</em>,
  <em>beautiful</em>, <em>honest</em>, and <em>melodic</em> motifs are characteristic
  of Bandujeewa’s poetic diction.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Chamini Kulathunga is a translator from Sri Lanka working with contemporary
  Sri Lankan Sinhalese literature. She is a second year MFA candidate in literary
  translation at University of Iowa’s Translation Workshop. She was a visiting fellow
  at Cornell University’s South Asia Program in the summer of 2019, and is the blog
  editor and a member of the editorial board of <em>Exchanges: Journal of Literary
  Translation</em>.</p>"
