poem: "« Tu es française ?\n— Oui.\n— Moi aussi. »\nElle n’a pas d’F sur la poitrine.
  Une étoile.\n« D’où ?\n— Paris.\n— Il y a longtemps que tu es ici ?\n— Cinq semaines.\n—
  Moi, seize jours.\n— C’est beaucoup déjà, je sais.\n— Cinq semaines… Comment est-ce
  possible ?\n— Tu vois.\n— Et tu crois qu’on peut tenir ? »\nElle mendie. \n« Il
  faut essayer.\n— Vous, vous pouvez espérer mais nous… »\nElle montre ma jaquette
  rayée et elle        montre son manteau, un manteau trop grand tellement, trop sale
  tellement, trop en loques tellement.\n« Oh, nos chances sont égales, va… \n— Pour
  nous, il n’y a pas d’espoir. »\n        Et sa main fait un geste et son geste évoque
  la fumée qui monte.\n« Il faut lutter de tout son courage.\n— Pourquoi… Pourquoi
  lutter puisque nous devons toutes… »\n        Le geste de sa main achève. La fumée
  qui monte. \n« Non. Il faut lutter.\n— Comment espérer sortir d’ici. Comment quel-qu’un
  sortira-t-il jamais d’ici. Il vaudrait mieux se jeter dans les barbelés tout de
  suite. »\n        Que lui dire ? Elle est petite, chétive. Et je n’ai pas le pouvoir
  de me persuader moi-même. Tous les arguments sont insensés. Je lutte contre ma raison.
  On lutte contre toute raison. \n        La cheminée fume. Le ciel est bas. La fumée
  traîne sur le camp et pèse et nous enveloppe et  c’est l’odeur de la chair qui brûle.\n\n<h2>[Vous
  qui avez pleuré deux mille ans]</h2>\nVous qui avez pleuré deux mille ans\nun qui
  a agonisé trois jours et trois nuits\n\nquelles larmes aurez-vous\npour ceux qui
  ont agonisé\nbeaucoup plus de trois cents nuits et beaucoup\n    plus de trois cents
  journées\ncombien\npleurerez-vous\nceux-là qui ont agonisé tant d’agonies\net ils
  étaient innombrables\n\nIls ne croyaient pas à résurrection dans l’éternité\nEt
  ils savaient que vous ne pleureriez pas.\n\n"
transpoem: "Are you French?\nYes.\nMe too.\n\nShe doesn’t have an F on her chest.
  A star.\n\nWhere from?\nParis. \nYou’ve been here a long time?\nFive weeks.\nSixteen
  days for me. \nThat’s already a long time, I know.\nFive weeks… How is that possible?\nWell,
  you know. \nAnd you think we can make it?\n\nShe pleads.\n\nWe have to try. \nYou
  can hope, but us…\n\nShe points to my striped jacket and then to her own coat, a
  coat much too big, much too dirty, much too worn.\n\nOh, our chances are equal,
  don’t worry…\nThere’s no hope for us.\n\nAnd she makes a gesture, a gesture of rising
  smoke. \n\nWe have to fight with all our courage. \nWhy… Why fight when we we’re
  all bound to…\n\nThe gesture finishes the sentence. The rising smoke.\n\nNo. We
  have to fight.\nHow can you hope to leave here. How will anyone ever leave here.
  It’d be better to just throw ourselves at the barbed wire right now.\n\nWhat do
  I tell her? She’s small, puny. And I can’t even convince myself. Every argument
  is senseless. I fight against my own reason. We fight against all reason. \n\nThe
  chimney smokes. The sky is low. The smoke, heavy, hangs over the camp and envelops
  us and it’s the smell of burning flesh.\n\n<h2>[You who cried two thousand years]</h2>\n\nYou
  who cried two thousand years\nfor one who died for three days and three nights\n\nwhat
  tears will you have\nfor those who died\nfor much longer than three hundred nights
  and much \nlonger than three hundred days\nhow much\nwill you cry\nfor those who
  died so many deaths\nand they were countless\n\nThey did not believe in resurrection
  and eternal life\nand they knew you would not cry. "
note: "<p>Charlotte Delbo’s “Dialogue” presents a conversation between two people,
  a woman and the poem’s narrator, and the narrator’s inner thoughts. Given that “Dialogue”
  appeared in <em>Aucun de nous ne reviendra</em> (<em>None of Us Will Return</em>),
  a collection of poetry greatly informed by Delbo’s time imprisoned at Auschwitz,
  it is likely that the poem presents a conversation that Delbo actually took part
  in and her thoughts during it. The poem, in a way that is both stunning and simple,
  presents the difficulty that comes with trying to instill hope in others while not
  truly having hope oneself — a phenomenon truly representative of Delbo’s experiences.</p>\n\n<p>In
  translating “Dialogue,” I had two primary goals. First, I wanted to maintain the
  conversational nature of the poem, ensuring that the bits of conversation sounded
  like actual words that could have been exchanged between two women in a prison camp.
  As a result, various contractions such as “you’ve,” “that’s,” and “there’s” occur
  throughout my translation. Additionally, I try to use simple language throughout
  the parts of the poem that are conversation, often choosing more colloquial forms
  of words that have multiple translations. For example, I translate <em>tenir</em>
  as “make it” rather than “hold out” or “resist,” <em>faut</em> as “have to” rather
  than “must,” and <em>lutter</em> as “fight” rather than “resist” or “struggle.”</p>\n\n<p>In
  my translation, I also wanted to emphasize and distinguish the different narratives
  within the poem. For that reason, I introduced space between the bits of conversation
  and the narrator’s inner thoughts. Additionally, in an effort to distinguish between
  the two speakers and the intervening inner thoughts, I indented the three components
  to varying degrees. Finally, because I thought the different indentations clarified
  who was speaking during the conversation, I removed the quotation marks from the
  poem to avoid redundancy.</p>\n\n<p>My primary goal in translating the second poem
  was to stick as closely as possible to Delbo’s original, as I found the poem particularly
  striking. My greatest difficulty was in deciding how to translate the past tense
  of <em>agoniser</em>, which appears throughout the poem. Literally, <em>agoniser</em>
  means “to be dying” or “to be about to die.” Literally translating the past tense
  of agoniser would have led to particularly wordy English phrases in the poem, such
  as “for one who was dying for three days and three nights” or “for those who were
  dying so many deaths.” Therefore, to retain the poem’s simplicity, I translated
  the past tense of <em>agoniser</em> as “died.” As “died” often appeared next to
  time phrases (e.g. “for three days and three nights”), I hoped it would retain some
  sense of the continuous action that <em>agoniser</em> inherently implies.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally,
  I decided to translate the forms of <em>pleurer</em> that appear in the poem as
  “cry” rather than “weep,” which other translations have used. Though the use of
  “weep” would have deepened the Biblical allusions already present in the poem, I
  chose to use “cry” because it rhymes with “die,” which introduces a nice cadence
  to the translation. </p>"
abio: "<p>Charlotte Delbo (1913–1985) was a French author known primarily for her
  memoirs about her time as a prisoner in Auschwitz, where she was sent for her participation
  in the French Resistance. Though she was not in France at the beginning of the collaborationist
  Vichy regime, Delbo returned in 1941 when a friend of hers was sentenced to death
  for his activities as a member of the Resistance. Upon her return to Paris, Delbo
  joined the Resistance herself, but was arrested four months later in March of 1942.
  She spent almost eleven months in various French prison camps, and in January 1943
  was deported to Auschwitz, where she was for about a year. In the years after the
  war, Delbo wrote <em>Auschwitz et après</em> (<em>Auschwitz and after</em>), a memoir
  comprising three works: <em>Aucun de nous ne reviendra</em> (<em>None of Us Will
  Return</em>), <em>Une connaissance inutile</em> (<em>Useless Knowledge</em>), and
  <em>Mesure de nos jours</em> (The Measure of Our Days). Though Delbo struggled greatly
  with what she experienced during the war, she remained politically active after
  it ended and believed she had lived a beautiful life.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Rhosean Asmah is a senior at the University of Pennsylvania. She studies
  linguistics and has minors in both fine arts and French and Francophone studies.
  She loves hot weather, anything to do with books, and Katsushika Hokusai’s <em>The
  Great Wave Off Kanagawa</em>, among other things. You can probably find her in her
  room. Interestingly, she didn’t know she liked poetry until she took a class about
  translating it.</p>"
