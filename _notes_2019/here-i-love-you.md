pid: here-i-love-you
title: Aquí te amo
transtitle: Here I Love You
author: Pablo Neruda
translator: Stephanie Diaz
poem: "Aquí te amo. \nEn los oscuros pinos se desenreda el viento. \nFosforece la
  luna sobre las aguas errantes. \nAndan días iguales persiguiéndose. \n\nSe desciñe
  la niebla en danzantes figuras. \nUna gaviota de plata se descuelga del ocaso. \nA
  veces una vela. Altas, altas estrellas. \n\nO la cruz negra de un barco. \nSolo.
  \nA veces amanezco, y hasta mi alma está húmeda. \nSuena, resuena el mar lejano.
  \nEste es un puerto. \nAquí te amo. \n\nAquí te amo y en vano te oculta el horizonte.
  \nTe estoy amando aún entre estas frías cosas. \nA veces van mis besos en esos barcos
  graves, \nque corren por el mar hacia donde no llegan. \nYa me veo olvidado como
  estas viejas anclas. \nSon más tristes los muelles cuando atraca la tarde. \nSe
  fatiga mi vida inútilmente hambrienta. \nAmo lo que no tengo. Estás tú tan distante.
  \nMi hastío forcejea con los lentos crepúsculos. \nPero la noche llega y comienza
  a cantarme. \nLa luna hace girar su rodaje de sueño. \n\nMe miran con tus ojos las
  estrellas más grandes. \nY como yo te amo, los pinos en el viento,\nquieren cantar
  tu nombre con sus hojas de alambre."
transpoem: "Here I love you.\nIn the dark pines the wind untangles itself.\nThe moon
  radiates over the roaming waters.\nIdentical days chase after each other.\n\nFog
  loosens into dancing figures.\nA silver seagull unhooks from the sunset.\nSometimes
  a sail. High, high stars.\n\nOr the black cross of a boat.\nAlone.\nSometimes I
  wake and even my soul is damp.\nThe faraway sea sounds and resounds.\nThis is a
  port.\nHere I love you.\n\nHere I love you and in vain the horizon hides you.\nI
  am loving you still among these frozen things.\nSometimes my kisses leave in those
  grave boats,\nwhich run towards a sea they never reach.\nI find myself already forgotten
  like these old anchors.\nThe piers are sadder when the night docks.\nMy uselessly
  starving life grows tired.\nI love what I do not have. You are so distant.\nMy weariness
  wrestles with slow twilights.\nBut night arrives and starts its serenade.\nThe moon
  spins her clockwork dreams. \n\nThe greatest stars look at me with your eyes.\nAnd
  because I love you, the pines in the wind, \nlong to sing your name with their wire
  leaves."
note: "<p>Neruda’s “Aquí te amo” is a playground of images shifting from darkness
  of the trees in the opening line to phosphorescence of the moon in the next. The
  visuals that Neruda provides, coupled with the sense of touch that <em>la niebla</em>
  and <em>húmeda</em> evoke, make the original an in-depth and lyrical experience,
  which I tried to capture in my translation. The issue I encountered and re-encounter
  every time I revisit this translation is the use of the phrase “I love you.” This
  staple of the English language has often seemed overused to me, as though it does
  not carry the weight or connotation that it should. I realized, however, that this
  did in some ways play into the meaning that I saw in the original — not because
  Neruda’s <em>aquì te amo</em> is meaningless or trivial, but rather because it is
  simple. The line holds a certain immediacy that is not urgent or impatient but frank,
  honest, and pure, which I felt I would lose with a phrase other than our English
  equivalent.</p>"
abio: "<p>Pablo Neruda, born in 1904, was a Chilean poet and diplomat who won the
  Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971. Neruda’s works include poems such as “Aquí te
  amo” as well as epics, an autobiography, and manifestos. Despite his success in
  Chile and around the world, Neruda remains lesser-known in the United States —perhaps
  due to his politics, specifically his close ties to the Communist Party. In his
  youth, Neruda was guided by Gabriela Mistral, a Chilean writer who took note of
  Neruda’s talent and mentored him.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Stephanie Diaz is a junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying French
  and Francophone studies, with minors in art history and sociology. Defining “home”
  is a bit difficult for her, but all the same she’ll tell you that she grew up in
  a small town in Georgia and that her family comes from a Mexican town called Rio
  Verde. Stephanie grew up speaking Spanish, despite initial difficulties rolling
  her Rs. She started learning French in high school and has been studying the language
  and culture ever since. Her hobbies include baking, gardening, and dreaming of a
  future life in a cottage by a lake with dogs and a garden.</p>"
