poem: "没法折出那种简单好看的纸鸽\n我总是把自己的犹豫\n和周围的夜色一起折进去\n\n\n把它放在孩子床边\n就像留下一封兴之所至的短信\n里面有被琴声慢慢举到空中的牧场
  \               \n                                     \n折痕很深的日子    \n以及坐在春天面前的一个美好的疯子
  \   \n\n                                         \n我没法折出那种简单好看的纸鸽\n即使在堆满纸条的桌前\n这安静的车间里\n劳动仍然拖着极其微妙的阴影\n\n\n微笑的孩子\n是否能接受这其中的秘密\n可爱的小小玻璃房子
  \       \n当秋天挟带的石块滚过屋顶\n每一块玻璃是否能完好无损"
transpoem: "I can’t fold that kind of simple and pretty paper crane\nAlways, I fold
  it with my own hesitation\nand with the shades of night\n\nI put it besides a child’s
  bed\nas if to leave a spontaneous short letter \nInside it, there is a meadow slowly
  lifted into                         \nthe sky with the melody of music\n\nOn days
  of the deepest folds\nand of a nice silly man sitting before the arrival of spring
  \                 \n                                         \nI cannot fold that
  kind of simple and pretty paper crane\nEven in front of a table piled with pieces
  of paper\nIn this quiet factory workshop\nlabor still drags its subtle shadow\n\nWill
  the smiling children \naccept the secret in it \nWhen rocks brought by the autumn
  roll over the roof        \nof this little lovely glassy house\nwill every piece
  of glass remain intact"
note: '<p>I love this short poem by Li Yuansheng because it reminds me of my own experience
  of folding paper cranes for loved ones. This poem also reminds me of Robert Duncan’s
  poem “Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow” and the novel <em>The Catcher
  in the Rye</em>. The literary translation of the title “<span lang="zh">纸鸽</span>”
  is “paper dove,” but I used “paper crane,” since “paper crane” is commonly recognized
  as a cultural element in China and worldwide and is most likely what the poem refers
  to. In China, people used to fold as many paper cranes as possible to pass on as
  gifts of best wishes or tokens of love to dear friends or significant others. This
  custom has largely died out due to the fast speed of life. I translated this poem
  using direct translation and everyday language to reflect its poetic style. Also,
  in the last three lines, I shifted the original order of the lines and added a proposition
  “of” in order to connect these lines in meaning as well as to narrow down the gap
  between the two languages. The last three lines in the original poem are: “The little
  lovely glassy house (<span lang="zh">可爱的小小玻璃房子</span>) / When rocks brought by the
  autumn roll over the roof (<span lang="zh">当秋天挟带的石块滚过屋顶</span>) / will every piece
  of glass remain intact (<span lang="zh">每一块玻璃是否能完好无损</span>)”. Li is a well-known
  poet in China, but his poetry collections have not yet been translated into English.
  I hope that my translation will make more people interested in reading Li’s poems.</p>'
