title: La Abandonada
transtitle: The Abandoned
author: Gabriela Mistral
translator: Perren Carrillo
poem: |-
  Ahora voy a aprenderme
  el país de la acedía,
  y a desaprender tu amor
  que era la sola lengua mía,
  como río que olvidase
  lecho, corriente y orillas.

  ¿Por qué trajiste tesoros
  si el olvido no acarrearías?
  Todo me sobra y yo me sobro
  como traje de fiesta para fiesta no habida;
  ¡tanto, Dios mío, que me sobra
  mi vida desde el primer día!

  Denme ahora las palabras
  que no me dio la nodriza.
  Las balbucearé demente
  de la sílaba a la sílaba:
  palabra “expolio,” palabra “nada,”
  y palabra “postrimería,”
  ¡aunque se tuerzan en mi boca
  como las víboras mordidas!

  Me he sentado a mitad de la Tierra,
  amor mío, a mitad de la vida,
  a abrir mis venas y mi pecho,
  a mondarme en granada viva,
  y a romper la caoba roja
  de mis huesos que te querían.

  Estoy quemando lo que tuvimos:
  los anchos muros, las altas vigas,
  descuajando una por una
  las doce puertas que abrías
  y cegando a golpes de hacha
  el aljibe de la alegría.

  Voy a esparcir, voleada,
  la cosecha ayer cogida,
  a vaciar odres de vino
  y a soltar aves cautivas;
  a romper como mi cuerpo
  los miembros de la “masía”
  y a medir con brazos altos
  la parva de las cenizas.

  ¡Cómo duele, cómo cuesta,
  cómo eran las cosas divinas,
  y no quieren morir, y se quejan muriendo,
  y abren sus entrañas vívidas!
  Los leños entienden y hablan,
  el vino empinándose mira
  y la banda de pájaros sube
  torpe y rota como neblina.

  Venga el viento, arda mi casa
  mejor que bosque de resinas;
  caigan rojos y sesgados
  el molino y la torre madrina.
  ¡Mi noche, apurada del fuego,
  mi pobre noche no llegue al día!
transpoem: "Now I am going to learn\nthe sour country,\nand unlearn your love,\nmy
  only language,\nlike a river that neglects\nits current, its edge, its bed.\n\nWhy
  did you gift me treasures\nwithout the means to forget?\nEverything passes me and
  I pass me\nlike a party dress for a party no one came to;\nToo much, my God, too
  much.\nMy life has passed me since the first day.\n\nNow you must give me the words\nthat
  my mother never could.\nI will babble and blubber them\nfrom syllable to syllable:\nthe
  word “plunder,” the word “nothing,”\nthe word “hell,”\nalthough they writhe in my
  mouth\nlike bitten snakes.\n\nI have sat\nin the middle of the Earth,\nmy love,
  \nin the middle of my life,\nto open up my veins and my chest,\nto peel myself like
  a pomegranate,\nand to break the red mahogany\nof my bones that once ached for you.\n\nI
  am burning all that we had:\nthe thick walls, the high rafters,\nuprooting one by
  one\nthe twelve doors you liked to open,\ntaking an axe\nto the well of happiness.\n\nI
  am going to throw out\nthe harvest we reaped yesterday,\nempty out the bottles of
  wine,\nand free the caged birds;\nI will dismember this homestead\nas if it were
  my body,\nthe mountain of ashes\nmeasured with fingers to the sky.\n\nHow dull the
  ache, how steep the cost,\nhow divine these things once were.\nThey don’t want to
  die: sniveling,\nbaring their vivid entrails!\nThe timbers understand and speak,\nthe
  wine pours itself to watch,\nand the flock of birds rises\ndisjointed and slow like
  the fog.\n\nMay the wind come. May this house burn\nbrighter than a forest of matches;\nMay
  the mill and the watchtower\nbuckle, red and slanted.\nMy night, rushed by the fire,\nmy
  poor night, run away from the day!"
note: |-
  <p>I began by doing a literal translation of the poem based on my own understanding of Spanish, the translations of “The Abandoned Woman” by Randall Conch and “Deserted” by Ursula Le Guin, and a Spanish-to-English dictionary. However, I wanted my translation to be just as intense, animated, impassioned, and senseless as the original, which a literal translation could never attain. In order to create a sense of reckless abandon in feeling and emotion, I took multiple liberties in order to evoke certain images or concepts.</p>
  <p>For example, in lines 5 and 6 of my translation, “neglects” replaces “forgets.” Here, the speaker, like the river, has made a conscious choice to ignore herself to the point of harm because every part of her has become her lover. Furthermore, I chose “neglect” because each part of her and every word she speaks embodies her lover in such a way that the speaker cannot truly forget no matter how hard she tries. In fact, there is a paradoxical futility in even trying to forget; any active effort to repress something further recalls it.</p> <p>There were times also when words and concepts in Spanish did not translate literally into English, such as <em>postrimería</em> in line 18 of the original. This word is only found in Spanish and is used to describe the four afterlife occurrences according to Catholicism: death, judgment, hell, and glory. Le Guin translated the word as “afterwards” and Conch translated it as “waiting-for-death.” Personally, Le Guin better renders the afterlife in her translation whereas Conch veers away from that in rendering this ad hoc neologism for what the living feel towards the afterlife. I chose “hell” to relate to the connotations of death and the already condemning tone of the poem. This abandonment represents the death of their love, a death that condemned the speaker to hell — to the flames and fire and pain and viscera. I also feel that this was an appropriate choice because it relates back to the first two lines of the third stanza: “Now you must give me the words / that my mother never could.” After all, a mother would never give a child the word “hell.”</p>
abio: "<p>Gabriela Mistral (1889–1957) was a Chilean poet, diplomat, educator, and
  humanist. In 1945, she became the first Latin American author and fifth woman to
  receive a Nobel Prize in Literature. She had many passionate affairs with both men
  and women, with perhaps the recently published correspondence between her and Doris
  Dana being the premier example of both her great capacity for love (if not passion)
  and her defiance of gender roles and stereotypes that the Chilean government had
  imposed on her. Central to her poems are nature, betrayal, love, and remorse, as
  seen in the translated poem, “La Abandonada,” which comes from a collection called
  <em>Locas mujeres</em> (<em>Crazy Women</em> or <em>Madwomen</em>, depending on
  the English translation). This poem in particular deals with abandonment after love.
  Although the original abandonment of the speaker by her lover is the catalyst for
  the poem, it becomes apparent that at the forefront of the poem is the speaker’s
  madness, her abandonment of every sense — a madness more complex and more nuanced
  than it appears to be. She descends into a visceral insanity that engulfs the poem
  in the all encompassing redness of flames, of rage, of passion, but in a way that
  is completely her: complicatedly human.</p>"
tbio: "<p>I translated this poem as my final project in Taije Silverman’s class “The
  Translation of Poetry and the Poetry of Translation.” I study Spanish , French,
  and comparative literature in the College, so I am constantly translating between
  languages, authors, times, etc.</p>"
