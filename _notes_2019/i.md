author: Rachel Bluwstein
translator: Shoshana Akabas
poem: "כָּזֹאת אָנֹכִי: שְׁקֵטָה \n,כְּמֵימֵי אֲגַם \nאוֹהֶבֶת שַׁלְוַת חֻלִּין, עֵינֵי
  תִינוֹקוֹת \n.וְשִׁירָיו שֶׁל פְרַנְסִיס זַ'ם \n\n.בְּשֶׁכְּבָר הַיָּמִים עָטְתָה
  נַפְשִׁי אַרְגָּמָן \nוְעַל רָאשֵׁי הֶהָרִים \nלְאֶחָד הָיִיתִי עִם הָרוּחוֹת הַגְּדוֹלוֹת
  \n.עִם צְרִיחַת נְשָׁרִים \n\n.בְּשֶׁכְּבָר הַיָּמִים... זֶה הָיָה בְּשֶׁכְּבָר
  הַיָּמִים \nהָעִתִּים מִשְׁתַּנּוֹת \n— וְעַכְשָׁו  \n.הִנֵה אָנֹכִי כָּזֹאת"
transpoem: "This is me: still \nlike waters of a lake, \nin love with the tranquility
  of normalcy, baby eyes, \nand the poems of Francis Jammes. \n\nIn past days, I wrapped
  my soul in crimson. \nAnd on the hilltops\nI was one with the great winds, \nwith
  the squall of eagles. \n\nIn past days…this happened in past days. \nThe moments
  changed \nAnd now — \nI am this."
note: |-
  <p>Hebrew poses several unique translation challenges. Many Hebrew words are rich with biblical context that can be difficult to convey in other languages. For example, argaman is a reddish-purple dye used in biblical times. Because of its use in the temple design, it has a regal connotation that is lost in the translation (“crimson”). The fact that articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and pronouns are often attached to other words in Hebrew allows for concision that is not possible in English (where “and” and “in” are individual words). The final line (three words) of the poem literally translates to “here, I am like this” — but that felt too wordy, so I chose to maintain the simplicity of the original last line instead. Finally, the gendered nature of Hebrew words (with a few set suffixes) makes rhyming
  much easier in Hebrew than English, so rhymes or slant-rhymes are mostly omitted from this translation, since I endeavored to preserve Rachel’s images above all else.</p>
