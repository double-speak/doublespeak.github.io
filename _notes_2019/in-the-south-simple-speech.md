poem: |-
  جُولي سَبايا الأَرضِ
  في أرضي
  وَصُولي واطحني شعبي
  جُولي وَصُولي
  واطحني صُلبي
  لن يَكتوي قَلبي
  لن يَكتوي قَلبي ولن يَدمَى
  تنحلُّ حمَّى العارِ
  في غَيبوبةِ الحمَّى
  لن يَكتَوي قَلبي ولن يَدمَى
  قَلبي الأَصمُّ الأَبكَمُ الأَعمَى.

  اللفظة البسيطة
  اللفظة البسيطة
  تَصلَّبَتْ والتهبَتْ
  والتهمَتْ عينَّي حين التهمت
  صَحوَ المدى ، والظلَّ والهجيرْ
  لم تبقِ لي من موطني الكبير:
  ثُلوجَهُ ، مروجَهُ ، خليجَهُ ، محيطَهُ
  ما خلَّفَتْ ذبابةٌ
  حَطَّتْ على خريطَة

transpoem: |-
  Inmates of the earth, roam
  freely on my land.
  Raid my people
  grind them.
  Roam, raid
  grind my spine.
  My heart won’t surrender.
  My heart won’t bleed or surrender.
  The fever of shame unravels
  in fever’s infinite slumber.
  My heart won’t bleed or surrender,
  my blind deaf mute heart.

  <h2>Simple Speech</h2>

  Simple speech
  hardened, burned
  and devoured my eyes. When it swallowed
  the expansive clear sky
  the shade
  and the high noon sun
  it left me nothing of my true home:
  not its snows, meadows, gulfs, oceans
  not even traces a fly leaves behind on a map.

note: "<p>Khalil Hawi uses simple language, repetition, and alliteration throughout
  his poems. The collection from which these poems come is structured in a way that
  the poems become shorter and shorter until it culminates in a poem with a title
  but no text. My goal was to maintain the simplicity and fluidity of the syntax while
  creating alliteration when it felt organic. I refrained from using too many coordinating
  conjunctions to intimate the fluidity of the Arabic structure, because too many
  “ands” would sound clunky. An issue I struggle with when translating Arabic poetry
  into English is avoiding sounding archaic. While these poems are dreary, they are
  also supposed to be fresh and light, despite their heavy content. Arabic has a lot
  of possessive constructions which tend to sound stilted in English. So, I tried
  to avoid them and alternated with “ ’s “ contractions. Finally, the first poem uses
  a series of imperatives (“roam,” “attack,” “grind,” etc.). I’m not sure how to make
  that clearer in the English.</p>"
abio: "<p>Khalil Hawi (1919–1982) was a prominent Lebanese poet known for his contribution
  to modernist Arabic poetry. Though literary critics agree that Hawi succeeded in
  creating a poetic style that was unique, they also criticized him for the grotesque
  and macabre imagery which permeates his poetry. Influenced by philosophy, religion,
  and politics, Hawi composed poetry that grappled with difficult questions of authenticity
  and modernity. But Hawi was a sensitive person. The impact of national defeat throughout
  Arab countries from the Fifties to the Eighties filled his poetry with a lingering
  malaise from which he was unable to break free. Hawi tragically took his own life
  in the summer of 1982 upon hearing news of Israel’s invasion of Lebanon during the
  1975 civil war, which lasted twenty-five years. It is difficult not to read Hawi’s
  poetry in light of his suicide. However, buried deep within the harrowing and nightmarish
  images he wove together is a story of a disturbed individual who created a language
  capable of exploring the harshest complexities of human emotional landscapes. Hawi
  is revered within Arabic literary circles as someone who used poetry to look deep
  into the abyss where others dared not.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Rawad Wehbe is a PhD student in the department of Near Eastern Languages
  and Civilizations at the University of Pennsylvania. He studies both pre-modern
  and modern Arabic literature with a focus on poetry. His decision to study Arabic
  as an undergraduate at UCLA to learn about his own culture and heritage as an Arab-American
  transformed into a dedication to explore new approaches to imagine, frame, read,
  and eventually teach, Arabic literature. He currently lives in Philadelphia, PA,
  but usually spends his summers in Lebanon, where he teaches Arabic at the American
  University of Beirut.</p>"
