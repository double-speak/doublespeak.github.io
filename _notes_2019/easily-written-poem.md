poem: |-
  창밖에 밤비가 속살거려
  육첩방은 남의 나라.

  시인이란 슬픈 천명인 줄 알면서도
  한 줄 시를 적어 볼까.

  땀내와 사랑내 포근히 품긴
  보내 주신 학비 봉투를 받어

  대학 노트를 끼고
  늙은 교수의 강의 들으러 간다.

  생각해 보면 어린 때 동무를
  하나, 둘, 죄다 잃어버리고

  나는 무얼 바라
  나는 다만, 홀로 침전하는 것일까?

  인생은 살기 어렵다는데
  시가 이렇게 쉽게 쓰여지는 것은
  부끄러운 일이다.

  육첩방은 남의 나라
  창밖에 밤비가 속살거리는데,

  등불을 밝혀 어둠을 조금 내몰고,
  시대처럼 올 아침을 기다리는 최후의 나.

  나는 나에게 작은 손을 내밀어
  눈물과 위안으로 잡는 최초의 악수.
transpoem: "The evening rain whispers outside the window,\na room of six <em>tatami</em>
  mats is another’s country.\n\nKnowing the sad fate of a poet,\nshall I write a line?\n\nI
  receive my tuition envelope sent to me\nembraced with sweat and love\n\nTightly
  holding my college notebook\nI walk to the lecture of my old professor.\n\nCome
  to think of it, my friends from youth,\none, two, lost them all\n\nFor what\ndo
  I sink alone? \n\nIt’s shameful\nthat poems are so easily written\nwhen life is
  so hard.\n\nA room of six tatami mats is another’s country,\nthe evening rain whispers
  outside the window\n\nLighting the lamp, I expel the little darkness,\nthe last
  of me waiting for the morning\narriving like a new era.\n\nI extend these small
  hands to myself\nwith tears and consolation,\nfor my first handshake."
note: "<p>The despair, loneliness, and simplicity of this poem were the most difficult
  aspects to translate. Without the same experiences, I will never be able to fully
  express the thoughts of Yun Dong-ju while writing this poem, as he was truly in
  pain at the time he was living in Japan, the another’s country. However, I did make
  some choices in an attempt to recreate his experience. For example, the line, “a
  room of six <em>tatami</em> mats in another’s country,” is a reference to Yun’s
  college years in university while in Japan, which colonized Korea during this time.
  The tatami mat is a classic material and style of flooring that Japan had and is
  very unique to that country and culture. Therefore, I wanted to keep this word first
  because there is no other word in English to describe it, and second, to include
  the history of the Japanese colonization of Korea. Additionally, the lines “For
  what / do I sink alone?” are shortened from the original lines, which literally
  state “I expect what / Just I, alone sinking?” These lines really drove home the
  pure feeling of being alone, and though I changed the literal translation, I wanted
  to maintain the simplicity and absolute emptiness throughout the poem. Again, the
  moments of nostalgia and of loneliness are so seamlessly connected and embedded
  in the original, which made producing the same feelings incredibly difficult.</p>"
abio: <p>Yun Dong-ju (<span lang="ko">윤동주</span>) is a Korean poet who was born in
  1917 In Myeongdong Village of Jilin in China and died in 1945 at the age of twenty-seven
  in Fukuoka, Japan. From 1910 to 1945, Korea was colonized by Japan and underwent
  “cultural cleansing,” which was enacted through a series of unfair and often violent
  methods. Korea people were prohibited to speak Korean, write in Korean, own Korean
  books, teach and learn in Korean, and hold their Korean names. It soon became dangerous
  for Yun to write in Korean, as it was interpreted by the Japanese to be a rebellion.
  Yun’s older cousin, Song Mongyu, was a huge influence in his life as well. As a
  talented prose writer and an activist in the Korean independence movement, Song
  himself worked with Yun and a few other college friends to create literary magazines
  back in Yeonhi University, which is now Yeonsae University. Song likely instilled
  in Yun the desire to refuse complete submission from the Japanese rule by continuing
  to write the Korean poetry he loved so much. Upon completing his education there,
  he moved to Rikkyo University in Tokyo and then transferred six months later to
  Doshisha University in Kyoto, where he was soon taken captive by the Japanese police
  to Fukushima prison, where he died, most likely as a victim of medical experiments.
  Yun never was able to publish his collection of poems, <em>Star, Sky, Wind, and
  Poetry</em>, because he was arrested as a revolutionary activist, but because he
  had given them to a close friend in Korea, Chong Pyong-uk, to hide until it was
  able to be published, Yun’s poems exist today for many to read.</p>
