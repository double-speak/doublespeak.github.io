poem: "Quand je devise assis aupres de vous,\n        \tOut le cœur me tressaut :\nJe
  tremble tout de nerfs et de genous,\nEt le pouls me defaut.\nJe n’ay ny sang ny
  esprit ny haleine,\nQui ne se trouble en voyant mon Heleine,\n        \tMa chere
  et douce peine.\n \nJe devien fol, je perds toute raison :\nCognoistre je puis\nSi
  je suis libre, ou captif en prison\n        \tPlus en moy je ne suis.\nEn vous voyant,
  mon œil perd cognoissance :\nLe vostre altere et change mon essence,\n        \tTant
  il a de puissance\n \nVostre beauté me fait en mesme temps\n        \tSouffrir cent
  passions :\nEt toutesfois tous mes sens sont contents,\n        \tDivers d’affections.\nL’œil
  vous regarde, et d’autre part l’oreille\nOyt vostre voix, qui n’a point de pareille,\n
  \       \tDu monde la merveille.\n \nVoyla comment vous m’avez enchanté,\nHeureux
  de mon malheur :\nDe mon travail je me sens contenté,\n        \tTant j’aime ma
  douleur :\nEt veux tousjours que le torment me tienne,\nEt que de vous tousjours
  il me souvienne,\n        \tVous donnant l’ame mienne.\n \nDonce ne cherechez de
  parler au Devin,\nQui sçavez tout charmer :\nVous seule auriez un esprit tout divin,\nSi
  vous pouviez aimer.\nQue pleust à Dieu, ma moitié bien-aimée\nQu’Amour vous eust
  d’une fleche enflammee\nAutant que moy charmee.\n \nEn se jouant il m’a de part
  en part\n        \tLe cœur outrepercé :\nA vous s’amie il n’a monstré le dart\n
  \       \tDuquel il m’a blessé.\nDe telle mort heureux je me confesse,\nEt ne veux
  point que le soucy me laisse\n        \tPour vous, belle Maistresse.\n \nDessus
  ma tombe escrivez mon soucy\n        \tEn lettres grossement :\nLe Vendomois, lequel
  respose icy,\n        \tMourut en bien aimant.\nComme Pâris, là bas faut que je
  voise,\nNon pour l’amour d’une Helene Gregeoise,\n        \tMais d’une Saintongeoise."
transpoem: "When I imagine myself seated beside you,\n                My heart leaps
  from its place:\nI tremble from my every limb,\n                And my pulse fails
  me.\nI have neither blood, nor soul, nor breath,\nThat remains untroubled when I
  see my Helen,\nMy dear and sweet pain.\n \nI become mad, I lose all reason:\n                I
  cannot know\nIf I am free, or captive in prison:\n                I am no longer
  myself.\nWhen I see you, mine eye sees naught else:\nWhilst yours alters and changes
  my soul,\n                So powerful is your gaze.\n \nYour beauty makes me at
  once\n                Suffer a hundred passions\nAll the while all my senses are
  content\nDevoid of any ardor.\nMine eye sees you, whereas mine ear\nHears your voice,
  which has no peer\n                In this world, and marvels.\n \nIt is thus that
  you have enchanted me,\n                Joyful in my sorrow:\nI am contented with
  my work,\n                Such is my love for my own sadness:\nI wish always for
  torment to grasp me,\nAnd for me to forever remember you,\n                Giving
  unto you my own soul.\n \nTherefore, look no longer to the words of the Prophet,\n
  \               Who knows how best to charm:\nYou alone would have a wholly divine
  spirit,\n                If you could have loved.\nIf God so pleased, my cherished
  better half,\nIf only Love had inflamed your heart\n                With the arrow
  that charmed mine.\n \nIn his game, Love has most completely\n                Pierced
  my heart:\nTo you, his friend, he has not shown the dart\n                With which
  he has injured me.\nI confess myself to be such a victim,\nYet do not wish to diminish
  my love\n                For you, graceful Madame.\n \nAbove my tomb write of my
  love\n                In letters bold and large:\nThe Vendômois, who rests here,\n
  \               Died whilst truly loving.\nAs did Paris, there I must see it was,\nNot
  for the love of a Grecian Helen,\nBut for that of a Saintongeoise."
note: "<p>Helen of Sparta, daughter of Zeus and a woman whose beauty was of mythic
  proportions, is often portrayed as the reason behind the fall of Troy, her irresistible
  allure causing conflict between the Greeks and Trojans over possession of her person.
  In this <em>chanson</em> or song, Ronsard has written an ode to Helen, describing
  her unparalleled beauty. However, in doing so, he has made use of a very interesting
  vocabulary, constantly linking the narrator’s adoration of her striking good looks
  to his own terrors, fears, unhappiness, and injuries. According to Ronsard, does
  Helen truly represent the pinnacle of human beauty, and if so, is this beauty something
  for which we are to strive? Her ravishing appearance has caused the downfall of
  many men and the narrator’s admiration of the wonders of her visage seems to be
  causing him physical and mental pain. The last stanza is particularly telling, as
  he then links this mythic metaphor to a more tangible example, his love for a woman,
  hailing from Saintonge, who seems to have rejected his advances.</p>\n \n<p>Appearing
  in the volume <em>Les Amours</em>, a collection of sonnets, chansons, madrigals,
  and other poems dedicated to the topic of love and often based on mythical ideas,
  this poem is a truly well-written and beautiful example of Ronsard’s subtle mastery
  of the language of poetry and love. In this translation, I have opted to stay as
  close to the original meaning as possible. I have not tried to carry through the
  syllabic meter and rhyme scheme of the original, focusing instead on the content
  of the poem. Ronsard’s original was highly conscient of the form and style in which
  it was written, with a very strict alternance of decasyllabic and hexasyllabic lines
  and a clear ABABCCC rhyme scheme in each stanza.</p>\n \n<p>I would like to thank
  Prof. Scott Francis of the French and Francophone Studies department for his help
  in editing my translation.</p>"
abio: "<p>Pierre de Ronsard was born in 1524 in Couture-Sur-Loir, a small village
  on the banks of the Loir River. After completing his education in Paris, he made
  a name for himself as a master poet. He often found work as a translator of classical
  works into vernacular French, and the influence of ancient myths is apparent in
  the subject matter of his poetry. Forming lifelong friendships with other popular
  poets of the era, he and six others joined together to form <em>la Pléiade</em>,
  a group of seven poets who were bound by stylistic, topical, and philosophical ideas
  of writing. Ronsard was a founding member of the group and has since been known
  as one of the greatest lyricists of French history. Today, while <em>la Pléiade</em>
  forms an essential part of the French literary canon and is studied by French literature
  students of all levels, it is almost unknown in the realm of English literature.
  Given the genius of Ronsard’s writings and his delicate touch with the French language,
  it seems only fitting that his works reach a wider audience.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Saagar Asnani is a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences at Penn triple
  majoring in biology, French, and music. An avid Francophile at heart, he has always
  been fascinated by the beauty of the language, France’s cultural contributions to
  modern society, and its rich history. Given his love of Medieval and Renaissance
  French literature, he hopes to continue to translate various works from Old and
  Middle French into English and make these masterpieces accessible to a wider audience.
  In addition to translation, he is an avid performer, and can often be seen on campus
  carrying his viola to rehearsals and concerts. After Penn, he intends to attend
  medical school.</p>"
