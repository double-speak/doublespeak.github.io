poem: "春天，十个海子全都复活\r\n在光明的景色中\r\n嘲笑这一野蛮而悲伤的海子\r\n你这么长久地沉睡到底是为了什么？\r\n\r\n春天，十个海子低低地怒吼\r\n围着你和我跳舞、唱歌\r\n扯乱你的黑头发，骑上你飞奔而去，尘土飞扬\r\n你被劈开的疼痛在大地弥漫\r\n\r\n在春天，野蛮而复仇的海子\r\n就剩这一个，最后一个\r\n这是黑夜的儿子，沉浸于冬天，倾心死亡\r\n不能自拔，热爱着空虚而寒冷的乡村\r\n\r\n那里的谷物高高堆起，遮住了窗子\r\n它们一半用于一家六口人的嘴，吃和胃\r\n一半用于农业，他们自己繁殖\r\n大风从东吹到西，从北刮到南，无视黑夜和黎明\r\n你所说的曙光究竟是什么意思"
transpoem: "Spring, ten Hai Zi are all resurrected.\r\nIn the landscape of light,\r\nThey
  laugh at this savage and sorrowful Hai Zi:\r\n“You’ve been sleeping for so long
  – what exactly is it for?”\r\n\r\nSpring, ten Hai Zi bellow deeply,\r\nDancing and
  singing around you and me.\r\nThey tear your dark hair, mount you and gallop away,
  kicking up the dirt.\r\nThe pain when you are chopped open permeates the earth.\r\n\r\nIn
  spring, this savage and vengeful Hai Zi\r\nIs the only Hai Zi left, the last one
  left.\r\nThis is the son of the night who is immersed in winter, enamored with death.\r\nHe
  is burning with his love for this void and frigid village\r\n\r\nWhere grains pile
  up high and block out the window.\r\nHalf of the grains are used in the mouths,
  eating, and stomachs of a family of six.\r\nThe other half are used in agriculture,
  reproducing themselves.\r\nThe gale blows from east to west, from north to south,
  ignoring the dark and dawn.\r\nThe light of dawn you spoke of – what exactly does
  it mean."
note: "<p>“Spring, Ten Hai Zi” is the last poem Hai Zi ever wrote. He was suffering
  from severe schizophrenia, with symptoms of hallucinations, and often had trouble
  sleeping at that time. Twelve days after finishing the poem, he lay on the tracks
  and let the train - the representation of modernity - end his life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hai
  Zi is known for his ability to put powerful, plain words into poetic form, and his
  language is known for its abstraction and obscurity. It is not that his language
  is sophisticated, but he often uses defamiliarization techniques to give simple
  imagery deeper cultural meanings while achieving linguistic simplicity. When translating
  the poem, I used alliteration to make the English translation more consistent. I
  also added subjects to unclear sentences and clarified the referents of pronouns
  to make the poem more understandable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is almost impossible to avoid
  compromises when I translated Hai Zi. In this poem, “Hai Zi (<span lang=“zh”>海子</span>),”
  the poet’s pen name, is the most difficult to translate. In Mandarin, there are
  three differently intoned pronunciations of “<span lang=“zh”>海子</span>”: third +
  neutral tone, which literally means “lakes in the Mongolian and Tibetan Highlands”
  in mandarin and also means the poet’s pen name; second (through tone sandhi) + full
  third tone, meaning “child of the sea”; and second (through tone sandhi) + neutral
  tone, meaning a personal name. Depending on its position in the sentence, Hai Zi’s
  name is commonly, if not invariably, pronounced in the second + neutral tone, which
  sounds the same as “<span lang=“zh”>孩子</span>”, the word for “child” in mandarin.
  For Sinophone readers, the first time they hear “ten Hai Zi,” they will easily hear
  “ten children.” The use of homophones is an essential point of the poem. Children
  represent nature, originality, possibility, and many things Hai Zi longs for. In
  addition, the imagery of “children being resurrected” is uncanny and eerily attractive.
  However, in my opinion, translating it as “ten children Hai Zi” will unnecessarily
  spoil the poetic beauty. In the original Chinese text, the two meanings are conveyed
  simultaneously within the same sound that creates a poetic ambiguity that cannot
  be translated fully.</p>"
abio: "<p>Haizi (<span lang=“zh”>海子</span>) is the pen name of the Chinese poet Zha
  Haisheng (<span lang=“zh”>查海生</span>). He was born in 1964 and was raised in a farming
  village in Anhui Province. He was admitted to Beijing University at the age of fifteen
  and began writing poetry during college years. When he was twenty, he started teaching
  at China University of Political Science and Law. Between 1984 and 1989, he wrote
  about 200 poems and several epics, and he traveled to Inner Mongolia and the Qinghai-Tibet
  Plateau. He died of suicide in March 1989 by letting himself run over by a train
  at Shanhaiguan, Great Wall. Haizi’s books published posthumously in China include <em>Earth</em> (1990), <em>Poems
  of Haizi</em> (1995), and <em>The Complete Poems of Haizi</em> (1999). He is now
  one of the most renowned and influential contemporary poets in China.</p>"
