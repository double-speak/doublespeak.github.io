title: Не пускайте поэта в Париж
transtitle: Don't Let the Poet Leave for Paris
author: Veronika Dolina
translator: Sophia Ampgkarian
poem: "Не пускайте поэта в Париж! \r\nПошумит, почудит — не поедет. \r\nОн поедет
  туда, говоришь, — \r\nОн давно этим бредит. \r\n\r\nНе пускайте поэта в Париж! \r\nТам
  нельзя оставаться. \r\nОн поедет туда, говоришь, — \r\nНе впервой расставаться.
  \r\n\r\nНе пускайте поэта в Париж! \r\nОн поедет, простудится — сляжет. \r\nКто
  ему слово доброе скажет? \r\nКто же тут говорил, говоришь. \r\n\r\nА пройдут лихорадка
  и жар — \r\nЗагрустит ещё пуще: \r\nГде ты, старый московский бульвар? \r\nКак там
  бронзовый Пушкин? \r\n\r\nОн такое, поэт, существо, — \r\nОн заблудится, как в лабиринте.
  \r\nНе берите с собою его. \r\nНе берите его, не берите! \r\n\r\nОн пойдёт, запахнувши
  пальто. \r\nКак ребёнок в лесу, оглядится. \r\nНу и что, говоришь, ну и что? \r\nОн
  бы мог и в Москве заблудиться. \r\n\r\nВсё равно где ни жить, говоришь. \r\nКто
  поймёт, говоришь, не осудит. \r\nНе пускайте поэта в Париж! \r\nОн там всё позабудет.
  \r\n\r\nВсё равно где ни лечь, говоришь, \r\nПод плитой да под гомоном птичьим.
  \r\nНе пустили б поэта в Париж — \r\nОн лежал бы на Новодевичьем."
transpoem: "Don’t let the poet leave for Paris!\r\nHe will fuss, fool around – but
  won’t go.\r\nOh, he will go there, you say,\r\nHe’s been babbling about it for ages.\r\n\r\nDo
  not let the poet leave for Paris!\r\nOne cannot remain out there.\r\nOh, he will
  still go, you say,\r\nIt’s not the first time we part ways.\r\n\r\nDo not let the
  poet leave for Paris!\r\nHe will go, catch a cold – fall gravely ill.\r\nThen who
  will speak kind words to him?\r\nAs if someone said them here, you say.\r\n\r\nAnd
  when the fever and flush pass –\r\nHis heartache will deepen alas.\r\nWhere are
  you, old Moscow boulevard?\r\nHow fares our dear bronze Pushkin bard?\r\n\r\nSuch
  a creature is the poet,\r\nThat he will go astray, as in maze.\r\nDo not bring him
  along with you.\r\nDon’t bring him, please do not!\r\n\r\nHe will stroll, overcoat
  crossed,\r\nGawking round – a babe in the woods.\r\nSo what, you say, so what?\r\nHe
  could get lost in Moscow, too.\r\n\r\nWherever one may live, you say,\r\nThey who
  understand won't chide.\r\n\r\nDo not let the poet leave for Paris!\r\nHe will forget
  everything there.\r\n\r\nWherever one may rest, you say,\r\nIt will be beneath tombstones
  and chirping birds.\r\nHad they not let the poet leave for Paris,\r\nHe would be
  resting in Novodevichy."
note: "<p>It was important to me that this translation carried a sense of conversation
  and argument between two voices as strongly as the original. On one hand, we have
  a voice fearful of the poet leaving, protective of his fragility, and on the other,
  we have a disenchanted cynic who has lost hope in Moscow and longs to go abroad.</p>\r\n<p>This
  back-and-forth argumentation is conveyed in the original with strong contradictions
  and negations in between lines, and the reproachful address <em>govorish</em> (“you
  say”). To preserve this stubbornness of both speakers, I chose to add the “oh” interjection
  in the first lines of the disagreement because I felt that it heightened the pessimism
  of the second voice. It conveys a certain nonchalance which knows the poet all too
  well.</p>\r\n<p>Another important aspect of the poem I paid attention to while translating
  was the characterization of the poet. He is portrayed as a ditz of sorts: hot-tempered,
  disoriented, and unable to act in self-preservation. I chose to connote this child-like
  innocence through verbs like \"gawk\" and \"chide”.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, it must be
  noted that Veronika Dolina recites the poem in the form of a light song, accompanied
  by her guitar. The repetition of <em>govorish</em> (“you say”) over and over with
  different statements each time gradually builds up frustration for her interlocutor.
  This effect is helped along by the phonological composition of <em>govorish</em>,
  which has three syllables yet is quick and harsh to pronounce, with a grating quality.
  Dolina almost mutters it under her breath in her performance. In English, however,
  “you say” is more bouncy with vowels, it is more smoothly digestible to the ear.
  To compensate for this reduced feeling of accusatory annoyance, I opted for more
  informal and fragmented sentences in stanzas 5 and 6, which mirror the hurried,
  staccato rhythm of the <em>govorish</em> clauses.</p>\r\n<p>I believe that these
  additions and compromises all helped to enhance in English the original’s emotionality,
  the impression of two sides tugging on different ends of a chord — one convinced
  that abroad is scary, and the other that home is no worse.</p>"
abio: "<p>Veronika Dolina is a Russian poet, songwriter, and bard born in 1956 in
  the USSR. She is seen as the successor to two of the greatest poetesses of twentieth-century
  Russian literature, Anna Akhmatova and Marina Tsvetaeva, and is called by her fans
  ‘the last one of the sixties’. She started writing and performing songs in her teenage
  years, but her career truly took off in her twenties, as she participated in the
  Grushinkiĭ Festivals and even appeared on television in 1978. She has written over
  500 songs of romance, of longing for the past, and has an eye for lyrically masterful
  metaphors which make her so beloved by old and young listeners alike. Her songs,
  often accompanied by her guitar, carry emotional tones of melancholy, liveliness,
  and passion. Today, Dolina acts as a judge in the “Romance of the 21st Century”
  writing contest on the Kultura television network and resides in Moscow.</p>"
