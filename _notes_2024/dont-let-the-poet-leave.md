transtitle: Don't Let the Poet Leave for Paris
author: Veronika Dolina
translator: Sophia Ampgkarian
poem: "Не пускайте поэта в Париж! \nПошумит, почудит — не поедет. \nОн поедет туда,
  говоришь, — \nОн давно этим бредит. \n\nНе пускайте поэта в Париж! \nТам нельзя
  оставаться. \nОн поедет туда, говоришь, — \nНе впервой расставаться. \n\nНе пускайте
  поэта в Париж! \nОн поедет, простудится — сляжет. \nКто ему слово доброе скажет?
  \nКто же тут говорил, говоришь. \n\nА пройдут лихорадка и жар — \nЗагрустит ещё
  пуще: \nГде ты, старый московский бульвар? \nКак там бронзовый Пушкин? \n\nОн такое,
  поэт, существо, — \nОн заблудится, как в лабиринте. \nНе берите с собою его. \nНе
  берите его, не берите! \n\nОн пойдёт, запахнувши пальто. \nКак ребёнок в лесу, оглядится.
  \nНу и что, говоришь, ну и что? \nОн бы мог и в Москве заблудиться. \n\nВсё равно
  где ни жить, говоришь. \nКто поймёт, говоришь, не осудит. \nНе пускайте поэта в
  Париж! \nОн там всё позабудет. \n\nВсё равно где ни лечь, говоришь, \nПод плитой
  да под гомоном птичьим. \nНе пустили б поэта в Париж — \nОн лежал бы на Новодевичьем."

  Don’t let the poet leave for Paris!
  He will fuss, fool around – but won’t go.
  Oh, he will go there, you say,
  He’s been babbling about it for ages.

  Do not let the poet leave for Paris!
  One cannot remain out there.
  Oh, he will still go, you say,
  It’s not the first time we part ways.

  Do not let the poet leave for Paris!
  He will go, catch a cold – fall gravely ill.
  Then who will speak kind words to him?
  As if someone said them here, you say.

  And when the fever and flush pass –
  His heartache will deepen alas.
  Where are you, old Moscow boulevard?
  How fares our dear bronze Pushkin bard?

  Such a creature is the poet,
  That he will go astray, as in maze.
  Do not bring him along with you.
  Don’t bring him, please do not!

  He will stroll, overcoat crossed,
  Gawking round – a babe in the woods.
  So what, you say, so what?
  He could get lost in Moscow, too.

  Wherever one may live, you say,
  They who understand won't chide.

  Do not let the poet leave for Paris!
  He will forget everything there.

  Wherever one may rest, you say,
  It will be beneath tombstones and chirping birds.
  Had they not let the poet leave for Paris,
  He would be resting in Novodevichy.
note: |-
  <p>It was important to me that this translation carried a sense of conversation and argument between two voices as strongly as the original. On one hand, we have a voice fearful of the poet leaving, protective of his fragility, and on the other, we have a disenchanted cynic who has lost hope in Moscow and longs to go abroad.</p>
  <p>This back-and-forth argumentation is conveyed in the original with strong contradictions and negations in between lines, and the reproachful address <em>govorish</em> (“you say”). To preserve this stubbornness of both speakers, I chose to add the “oh” interjection in the first lines of the disagreement because I felt that it heightened the pessimism of the second voice. It conveys a certain nonchalance which knows the poet all too well.</p>
  <p>Another important aspect of the poem I paid attention to while translating was the characterization of the poet. He is portrayed as a ditz of sorts: hot-tempered, disoriented, and unable to act in self-preservation. I chose to connote this child-like innocence through verbs like "gawk" and "chide”.</p>
  <p>Finally, it must be noted that Veronika Dolina recites the poem in the form of a light song, accompanied by her guitar. The repetition of <em>govorish</em> (“you say”) over and over with different statements each time gradually builds up frustration for her interlocutor. This effect is helped along by the phonological composition of <em>govorish</em>, which has three syllables yet is quick and harsh to pronounce, with a grating quality. Dolina almost mutters it under her breath in her performance. In English, however, “you say” is more bouncy with vowels, it is more smoothly digestible to the ear. To compensate for this reduced feeling of accusatory annoyance, I opted for more informal and fragmented sentences in stanzas 5 and 6, which mirror the hurried, staccato rhythm of the <em>govorish</em> clauses.</p>
  <p>I believe that these additions and compromises all helped to enhance in English the original’s emotionality, the impression of two sides tugging on different ends of a chord — one convinced that abroad is scary, and the other that home is no worse.</p>
abio: "<p>Veronika Dolina is a Russian poet, songwriter, and bard born in 1956 in
  the USSR. She is seen as the successor to two of the greatest poetesses of twentieth-century
  Russian literature, Anna Akhmatova and Marina Tsvetaeva, and is called by her fans
  ‘the last one of the sixties’. She started writing and performing songs in her teenage
  years, but her career truly took off in her twenties, as she participated in the
  Grushinkiĭ Festivals and even appeared on television in 1978. She has written over
  500 songs of romance, of longing for the past, and has an eye for lyrically masterful
  metaphors which make her so beloved by old and young listeners alike. Her songs,
  often accompanied by her guitar, carry emotional tones of melancholy, liveliness,
  and passion. Today, Dolina acts as a judge in the “Romance of the 21st Century”
  writing contest on the Kultura television network and resides in Moscow.</p>"
