transtitle: This Is the Pure Truth
author: Robert Bolaño
translator: Naomi Bernstein
poem: "Me he criado al lado de puritanos revolucionarios\nHe sido criticado ayudado
  empujado por héroes\nde la poesía lírica\ny del balancín de la muerte.\nQuiero decir
  que mi lirismo es DIFERENTE\n(ya está todo expresado pero permitidme\nañadir algo
  más). \nNadar en los pantanos de la cursilería\nes para mí como un Acapulco de sangre
  de pescado\nuna Disneylandia submarina\nEn donde soy en paz conmigo. \n\nRaro oficio
  gratuito          Ir perdiendo el pelo\ny los dientes           Las antiguas maneras
  de ser educado\nExtraña complacencia           (El poeta no desea ser más\nque los
  otros)           Ni riqueza ni fama ni tan sólo\npoesía           Tai vez ésta sea
  la única forma\nde no tener miedo           Instalarse en el miedo\ncomo quien vive
  dentro de la lentitud\nFantasmas que todos poseemos           Simplemente\naguardando
  a alguien o algo sobre las ruinas"
transpoem: "I was raised alongside revolutionary puritans \nI have been criticized
  saved and shoved by heroes \nof lyric poetry \nand the rocking chair of death. \nI
  want to say that my lyricism is DIFFERENT \n(everything has been expressed already
  but permit me \nto add one more thing). \nTo swim in the swamps of vulgarity \nis
  for me like an Acapulco of mercury \nan Acapulco of fish blood \nan underwater Disneyland
  \nwhere I am at peace with myself. \nStrange gratuitous trade           To go losing
  one’s hair\nand one’s teeth           The old ways of becoming educated \nStrange
  complacency           (The poet does not desire to be more \nthan others)           Neither
  in riches nor fame nor in poetry \nitself           Maybe this is the only form
  \nof not being afraid           To install oneself in the fear \nlike those who
  live within slowness \nGhosts that we all possess           Simply \nwaiting for
  someone or something among the ruins\n"
note: "<p>Aside from a few ambiguous words, the most difficult part about translating
  this poem was deciding whether it was one poem, or two. In his <em>Poesía Reunida</em>,
  the two sections sit on two consecutive pages, mirroring each other, and the second
  part has no title. The two parts have different spacing and punctuation patterns.
  They may very well be separate, but to me they seem inextricable, almost dialectical.
  I see them as a call and response — between the poet’s egoic inflation (a result
  perhaps of what Bolaño called “the shadow of ecstasy,” which according to him, even
  the worst and most “false” writers have glimpsed) and the “existential mediocrity”
  of his daily life.</p>"
abio: "<p>Roberto Bolaño was a virtuosic writer who rose to prominence in the English
  speaking world only after his death in 2003. Through postmodern structures and flourishes,
  he often takes anonymous, aspiring writers as his subjects, elevating their quotidian
  struggles to the level of an epic. He was known to admire the life of the poet,
  “so excessive, so risky,” he once said. He described poetry as the gesture of an
  adolescent who bets what little he has on a mysterious and little known form, and
  “who generally loses the bet.”</p>"
tbio: "<p>Naomi Bernstein is a rootless cosmopolitan currently living and writing
  in New York.</p>"
