title: Au maître d'un jardin
transtitle: To the master of a garden
author: Antoine-Vincent Arnault
translator: Gabrielle Wang
poem: "De ce chaume heureux possesseur, \nDe bon cœur, hélas ! que j'envie \nTes travaux,
  ta philosophie, \nTa solitude et ton bonheur ! \n\nPour prix des soins que tu leur
  donnes,\nTes arbustes reconnaissants\nEt des printemps et des automnes\nTe prodiguent
  les doux présents.\n\nÔ trop heureux qui peut connaître\nLa jouissance de cueillir\nLe
  fruit que ses soins font mûrir,\nLa fleur que ses soins ont fait naître !\n\nToujours
  la terre envers nos bras \nS'est acquittée avec usure. \nQui veut s'éloigner des
  ingrats \nSe rapproche de la nature. \n\nNe craindre et ne désirer rien, \nEtre
  aimé de l'objet qu'on aime, \nC'est bien là le bonheur suprême;\nC'est le sort des
  dieux, c'est le tien. "
transpoem: |-
  Of this grass content possessor,
  Of  good heart, alas! How I fancy
  Your labor, your philosophy,
  Your solitude and your comfort!

  For cost of care you give to them,
  Your shrubbery appreciative
  And with some springs and some autumns
  Lavish you the pleasant donatives.

  O too content who comprehends
  The joy which harvest can breed
  The fruit which his care has ripened,
  The flower which his care conceived !

  Always the earth beneath our arms
  Which has with our use unfettered.
  Those who wish to avoid ingrates
  Become ever close with nature.

  Apprehend and desire not,
  Being loved by that which we love,
  Is utter happiness–above;
  Is the sort of gods, what you’ve got.
note: "<p>Translating this poem was a delicate process. I often faced frustrations
  about how to best interpret and reflect decisions made by the author that were only
  grammatically correct in the French way–the way the words were intended. Quite literally
  mirroring meanings was necessary, for the subject-description order of words in
  French could be considered the direct opposite of English grammar. As a result,
  this mirroring often resulted in a loss of context and, consequently, accuracy of
  comprehension. A sense of suspense that could only be established in the original
  placement of phrases was also impossible to mimic with English while maintaining
  the laws of grammar. Thus, I intermittently broke various rules in my best efforts
  to preserve meaning, which may have resulted in a cacophony of mismatched grammar
  interpretations. I sincerely hope that my efforts to preserve meaning did not disturb
  the peaceful constancy in the parallel structures artfully posed by Antoine-Vincent
  Arnault at his time of writing. Reversing these phrases felt like upending all of
  Arnault’s careful deliberation, for poetry is inherently an art of precision and
  intention. As a migrated teenage admirer of French poetry, I often doubted that
  it was my place to take this beloved artist’s work into my young hands. Unqualified
  and equipped with the level of grammar enabled by a lifetime of geographical isolation,
  I frequently cringed at my elementary attempts to match the beauty of the original
  words. Furthermore, prioritizing meaning and intention meant rewriting the poem
  through the eyes of the original poet, thus sacrificing my own preferences in the
  process. In the end, this poem, line by line, is a series of one-sided compromises
  between the poet and myself, the translator.</p>\n"

  <p>Born in Paris in 1766, Antoine-Vincent Arnault was a French poet and fabulist who specialized in Republican tragedies. He established his reputation with his first work: Marius d Minturnes, a tragedy play first performed on May 19, 1791 on le Theatre Francais in Paris.</p>
  <p>As a sympathizer of the political group opposing the government during the Reign of Terror, Antoine-Vincent Arnault was forced to flee France until the political environment became less hostile. Regardless, he was arrested upon his return due to this allegiance. A lack of historical records makes it unclear how he evaded prison, but it is believed that fellow dramatists and changes in political climate likely assisted his liberation.</p>
  <p>Arnault re-established his reputation after commission from Napoleon Bonaparte and nomination as secretary general of L’Institut Francais. He was a member of the Légion D'Honneur: the highest order of merit established by Napoleon in 1802 to restore honor after the Revolution. As a poet and playwright, Arnault capsulated difficult periods of the French Revolution with works that reflected French ideals of fraternity and liberty.</p>
  <p>Although his arrest demonstrates ambiguity of his reception in France, Arnault made significant contributions to nationalism, greatly impacting the political landscape during his lifetime.</p>

  and Canadian immigrants and a member of a French-speaking household, poetry and
  literature has consistently been her method of embracing and connecting her heritage
  to her new American culture. Growing up in a relatively small town, the library
  was her favorite weekly adventure. After moving multiple times, reading has unfailingly
  remained along with passions for science, cooking, hiking, and meeting new people!</p>"
