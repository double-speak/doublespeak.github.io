poem: |-
  e como eu palmilhasse vagamente
  uma estrada de Minas, pedregosa,
  e no fecho da tarde um sino rouco

  se misturasse ao som de meus sapatos
  que era pausado e seco; e aves pairassem
  no céu de chumbo, e suas formas pretas

  lentamente se fossem diluindo
  na escuridão maior, vinda dos montes
  e de meu próprio ser desenganado,

  a máquina do mundo se entreabriu
  para quem de a romper já se esquivava
  e só de o ter pensado se carpia.

  Abriu-se majestosa e circunspecta,
  sem emitir um som que fosse impuro
  nem um clarão maior que o tolerável

  pelas pupilas gastas na inspeção
  contínua e dolorosa do deserto,
  e pela mente exausta de mentar

  toda uma realidade que transcende
  a própria imagem sua debuxada
  no rosto do mistério, nos abismos.

  Abriu-se em calma pura, e convidando
  quantos sentidos e intuições restavam
  a quem de os ter usado os já perdera

  e nem desejaria recobrá-los,
  se em vão e para sempre repetimos
  os mesmos sem roteiro tristes périplos,

  convidando-os a todos, em coorte,
  a se aplicarem sobre o pasto inédito
  da natureza mítica das coisas,

  assim me disse, embora voz alguma
  ou sopro ou eco ou simples percussão
  atestasse que alguém, sobre a montanha,

  a outro alguém, noturno e miserável,
  em colóquio se estava dirigindo:
  “O que procuraste em ti ou fora de

  teu ser restrito e nunca se mostrou,
  mesmo afetando dar-se ou se rendendo,
  e a cada instante mais se retraindo,

  olha, repara, ausculta: essa riqueza
  sobrante a toda pérola, essa ciência
  sublime e formidável, mas hermética,

  essa total explicação da vida,
  esse nexo primeiro e singular,
  que nem concebes mais, pois tão esquivo

  se revelou ante a pesquisa ardente
  em que te consumiste… vê, contempla,
  abre teu peito para agasalhá-lo.”

  As mais soberbas pontes e edifícios,
  o que nas oficinas se elabora,
  o que pensado foi e logo atinge

  distância superior ao pensamento,
  os recursos da terra dominados
  e as paixões e os impulsos e os tormentos

  e tudo o que define o ser terrestre
  ou se prolonga até nos animais
  e chega às plantas para se embeber

  no sono rancoroso dos minérios,
  dá volta ao mundo e torna a se engolfar
  na estranha ordem geométrica de tudo,

  e o absurdo original e seus enigmas,
  suas verdades altas mais que tantos
  monumentos erguidos à verdade;

  é a memória dos deuses, e o solene
  sentimento da morte, que floresce
  no caule da existência mais gloriosa,

  tudo se apresentou nesse relance
  e me chamou para seu reino augusto,
  afinal submetido à vista humana.

  Mas, como eu relutasse em responder
  a tal apelo assim maravilhoso,
  pois a fé se abrandara, e mesmo o anseio,

  a esperança mais mínima — esse anelo
  de ver desvanecida a treva espessa
  que entre os raios do sol inda se filtra;

  como defuntas crenças convocadas
  presto e fremente não se produzissem
  a de novo tingir a neutra face

  que vou pelos caminhos demonstrando,
  e como se outro ser, não mais aquele
  habitante de mim há tantos anos,

  passasse a comandar minha vontade
  que, já de si volúvel, se cerrava
  semelhante a essas flores reticentes

  em si mesmas abertas e fechadas;
  como se um dom tardio já não fora
  apetecível, antes despiciendo,

  baixei os olhos, incurioso, lasso,
  desdenhando colher a coisa oferta
  que se abria gratuita a meu engenho.

  A treva mais estrita já pousara
  sobre a estrada de Minas, pedregosa,
  e a máquina do mundo, repelida,

  se foi miudamente recompondo,
  enquanto eu, avaliando o que perdera,
  seguia vagaroso, de mãos pensas.
transpoem: "And as I came wandering, ponderously,\ndown some rough old Minas road,
  rocky, potholed, \nand at evening-fall the rusted peal of a bell\n\nmixed its bronze
  moan with my crunching footsteps,\npaced and crisp on the stones; and in the leaden
  sky\nbirds were hovering, their charcoal, corvid forms\n\nslowly dissolving, as
  if swallowed back\ninto the greater darkness coming off the mountains\nand from
  my ownmost, disabused self,  \n\nthe machine of the world unveiled itself \nto me,
  who would sooner have recoiled on sight,\njust turned and ran at the very prospect
  of it.\n\nIt gaped before me, majestic and circumspect,\nand none but the purest
  of sounds met my ears\nand a brilliant light unburdened my glare-worn eyes, \n\nsoothing
  pupils baked by constant, painful\ninspection of searing wastes and deserts,\nand
  mind exhausted by contemplations\n\nof a reality beyond the reflections\nwatching
  from the pool over which it leans,\nlost in the face of mystery, in the abyss.\n\nIt
  opened to me calm and pure, inviting\nwhat meanings and intuitions there remained\nto
  one who had used up a life’s-worth already\n\nand had no inclination to recover
  them\nif only to retread, forever and in vain,\nthe same sad unscripted peregrinations,\n\nbut
  here it beckoned to them, one by one in train,\nto ruminate upon this virgin pasture\nof
  the mythical nature of all things.\n\nOr so I was told, though no voice was heard,\nor
  wind rush, or echo, or simple percussion\nto testify that one, up on the mountainside,\n\naddressed,
  in colloquy, this listening other \n—nocturnal, miserable—, with these uttered words:\n“That
  which you seek within yourself, or beyond\n\nyour own restricted being, and has
  never\nrevealed itself, or feigned revealing, but coyly\nwithdraws further and further
  from perception,\n\nMark it now, watch and listen: this abundance\nvastly richer
  than any pearl, this science,\nsublime and formidable, yet hermetic,\n\nthis total
  explanation of all life,\nthis nexus, primordial and singular,\nso elusive it forever
  slipped your grasp,\n\nimpenetrable to the ardent inquiries\nthat long consumed
  your mind…see, contemplate,\nopen your bosom and let it come in.”\n\nThe most superb
  of bridges and high-rise towers,\nall that the workshops of men conspire to design,\nand
  once so drawn take form and far outstrip\n\nin distance even the widest striding
  thoughts,\nthe resources of the earth harnessed to our will,\nand the passions,
  and the impulses, the endless torments,\n\neverything that defines terrestrial being,\ncreaturely
  being, down to the animals, \nto all organic life, and beyond that still,\n\nto
  the rancorous slumber of minerals and ores,\nit swirls around the globe and is swallowed
  back\ninto the strange geometry of the whole,\n\nand the primal absurdity, its mysteries,\nand
  towering truths, taller than so many \nmonuments erected in the name of truth;\n\nand
  to the memory of the gods, and the solemn\nsentiment of death, which flowers on
  the stem\nof even the most glorious existence,\n\nit all presented itself in that
  same flash\nbeckoning me to its august kingdom,\nfinally bared for human eyes to
  see.\n\nBut as I hesitated, balking before\nthat miraculous and startling appeal,\nfor
  my faith had waned, and even my desire,\n\nthe most minimal of hopes—the yearning\nto
  see dispelled those folds of blackened cloud\nthat still encroached upon the sun's
  bright rays;\n\nbut as moribund beliefs scrambled to the front,\nsummoned from retirement,
  could not muster\nsufficient verve to reanimate that neutral face\n\nwhich I along
  these roads have shown the world, \nas if some other man, no more the tenant\nwho
  had occupied this body decades long, \n\nhad seized the reins and stirrups of my
  will,\nwhich, fickle as was its wont, curled itself shut,\nafter those shy, ungenerous
  flowers\n\nthat are, in themselves, both open and closed;\nbut just as \"late\"
  is often worse than \"never,\"\nand the belated gift is greeted with disdain,\n\nI
  lowered my gaze, listless, uncurious, \ndeclining to claim what was freely given,\nthere
  for me to do with as I pleased. \n \nThe most peerless darkness fast descended\nupon
  that rough old Minas road, rocky, potholed,\nand the machine of the world, its invite
  rebuffed,\n\nrecomposed in a shrinking whorl and then withdrew,\nas I, trying to
  measure what I’d spurned,\ncontinued on my way, hands wrung empty.\n"
note: |-
  <p>“A Máquina do Mundo” is widely considered the best Brazilian poem ever written, but I have yet to find an English translation that captures both its style and content with equal fidelity. Some take far too many liberties (one even imposes a non-existent rhyme scheme), while others are excessively literal in their approach. None, to my ear at least, really sounds like Drummond. So I wanted to produce a translation that was true to his original in content and style.</p>
  <p>The key to the pace and flow of this ninety-six-line poem is the fact that it is only six sentences long in Portuguese. While it wasn’t possible to match that exactly, I was able to keep it to only seven sentences.</p>
  <p>The poem was largely written in dodecasyllabic lines, with slight variations (many lines drop to eleven syllables or overshoot to thirteen). The basic pattern was three to four long stresses per line. To capture that stress pattern in English, I oscillated between decasyllable and dodecasyllable lines, to compensate for the reductions of unstressed syllables in Portuguese.  As English words tend to be shorter than Portuguese, I sometimes found that lines needed some padding so as not to break the pattern. However, this was always done without departing from Drummond’s basic intentions. For example, the line “passasse a comandar a minha vontade…” (thirteen syllables) would usually translate as “had begun to command my will…” (eight syllables), so I fleshed this out with a horse-riding image that spoke to the verb “command”—‘had seized the reins and stirrups of my will” (10 syllables). This allowed me to keep pattern with the preceding and following lines without altering the sense in any way.</p>
  <p>There is no rhyme in the poem, but there is frequent assonance, and I tried to mirror that where possible. Portuguese words are heavy in gender-specific “a” and “o” noun, adjective and participle endings, and a lot of the assonance is based on these (“uma estrada de Minas, pedregosa”). As English word endings are far more varied than in Portuguese, I often had to opt for alliteration and other forms of consonance (“rough old Minas road, rocky, potholed”) instead.</p>
abio: "<p>Carlos Drummond de Andrade was born in the mining town of Itabira, Minas
  Gerais, in 1902. He studied pharmacy, worked for a time as a journalist, and finally
  settled into a career in the civil service.  He is considered one of Brazil’s most
  important poets, and left an extensive oeuvre behind him upon his death in Rio de
  Janeiro, in 1987. Though he was part of the generation of modernists that transformed
  Brazilian literature and art, he was only ever modernist on his own terms, and he
  would be bound to no manifesto. Early on, he was mentored by both Oswald de Andrade
  and Mario de Andrade, but his own firmly held beliefs about poetry and the directions
  he wanted to take it put constant strains on these relationships. Original, mischievous,
  and critical, Drummond’s poetry probed Brazil’s sociopolitical reality and the often
  stark contrast between industrialized, urban modernity and the simplicity of the
  rural heartlands. There’s also a strong existentialist quality to his work, with
  his exploration of the themes of mortality, memory, regret and his own awkwardness
  in the world. As Mauro Villar points out, some critics see “three Drummonds”: the
  early humorous poet, the mid-career “social poet,” and, finally, the “semiclassical
  pessimist.” “A Máquina do Mundo” is perhaps best described in terms of the latter.
  It belongs to the volume <em>Claro Enigma</em>, published in 1951. </p>"
tbio: "<p>Anthony Doyle grew up in Ireland, but has lived in Brazil since 2000, where
  he works as a translator of fiction, nonfiction, screenplays and poetry, with over
  forty published titles. He is also the author of the children’s book <em>O Lago
  Secou</em> (Companhia das Letras, 2013) and the recently published speculative-fiction
  novel <em>Hibernaculum</em> (Out Of This World Press). He is a founding member of
  the poetry collective Old Scratch Press, based in California. In addition to his
  own poetry, he is currently translating an introductory selection of Drummond’s
  best poems.</p>"
