transpoem: "you pure and slight like candlefire\r\nyou like the morning tender clear\r\nyou
  blooming sprout from noble sire\r\nyou like a fount remote sincere\r\n\r\nescort
  my mien to sunsoaked meadows\r\nencompass me in evening depth\r\nilluminate my way
  in shadows\r\nyou chary gust you bateless breath\r\n\r\nyou are my wish and my sole
  knowing\r\ni breathe you in with each inhale\r\ni drink you in with each cup flowing\r\ni
  kiss you close with each sweet gale\r\n\r\nyou blooming sprout from noble sire\r\nyou
  like a fount remote sincere\r\nyou pure and slight like candlefire\r\nyou like the
  morning tender clear"
note: "<p>Any translation is a tightrope act balancing the global—form, look, mood—with
  the local—imagery, diction, device; here is my best attempt at preserving both.
  I started by listing off what absolutely could not be sacrificed, the elements of
  the poem which made it speak to me when I discovered it in a book of German poetry
  one still night. Above all, it had to sound right, with four stanzas of four lines
  each with an ABAB rhyme scheme, the A rhymes being feminine and the B rhymes being
  masculine, and with a delicate parallelism between the lines of each stanza. The
  original poem feels perfectly balanced, one word flowing into the next. Thus, some
  individual meanings needed to be done away with, so George’s „Du kühler wind du
  heisser hauch“ (“You cool wind you hot breath”) became “you chary gust you bateless
  breath” with entirely transformed adjectives. Similarly, the syntax of the second
  and fourth lines is thrown away to make room for the rhyme scheme, meter, and feel.
  A minor aside needs to be made about the typography: George de-capitalizes nouns
  in the original, so taking his lead, I de-capitalized the beginnings of lines to
  create an analogous but unsatisfyingly different effect.</p>\r\n<p>In the spirit
  of Symbolism, I have tried to preserve countless other small effects—to take the
  aforementioned line as an example, the binary of „kühler“ and „heisser“ transforms
  into another binary of “chary” and “bateless”, and the alliterative „heisser hauch“
  becomes the similarly alliterative “bateless breath”. Also significant is how the
  hard consonants in the first half of the original line melt into the gentle and
  whispering „heisser hauch“, an effect which I’ve attempted to preserve in my translation.
  Finally, George is an outlier in the German poetic tradition in that he strays far
  away from the vernacular, dipping into archaic and inventive diction, so I have
  attempted to channel a similar register. I hope this translation has a fraction
  of the magic of the original so that non-German-speaking readers might be as enchanted
  with this poem as I was the night that I discovered it.</p>"
abio: "<p>Stefan George (1868-1933) was a Symbolist poet and himself a frequent translator,
  translating his idols from Dante to Baudelaire into German. A fierce defender of
  art for art’s sake, George’s works are shrouded in aristocratism, classicism, and
  metaphor, a sharp reaction against the literary tendency of the age toward a more
  democratic naturalism and realism. During his lifetime, he decried the militarism
  and materialism of German culture, finding inspiration among Parisian bohemian poets
  and returning to Germany with the hope of newly invigorating the German language,
  starting the literary magazine <em>Blätter für die Kunst</em> (<em>Journal for the
  Arts<em>) to promote what he saw as “the new art.” His poems strive toward an ideal
  of unearthly beauty and eternal truth, and he saw the artist’s mission as the endeavor
  to create a noble society out of the ashes of German culture.</p>\r\n<p>Like those
  of Nietzsche before him, George’s works were co-opted by the Nazi Party to use as
  propaganda, a development George personally detested, declining any association
  with the Party. At the time of his death, George’s legacy remained troublingly mixed,
  as those inside Germany declared him as the prophet of the Third Reich while those
  outside Germany mourned the loss of a man who had fought his whole life for a worthier
  future for Germany, the Nazis embodying the brutality and banality that George had
  spent his entire life decrying under the German Empire.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Eric Tao is a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania
  studying mathematics and cognitive science, and he is deeply indebted to his friends
  and family for their love and support. He first encountered Stefan George through
  Arnold Schoenberg’s second string quartet, in whose last movement there is a mystical
  moment where the soprano enters with George’s words: „Ich fühle luft von anderem
  planeten“ (“I feel air from other planets”). In his spare time, he is an avid composer
  and an aspiring writer, and in all these respects, an enthusiastic lover of the
  German artistic tradition—and of art worldwide.</p>"
