note: "<p><em>Affrontare la gioia da soli (Facing Joy Alone)</em> is Francesco Tomada’s
  latest collection. This book, I believe, is meant to be enjoyed as a whole. Each
  poem is like a star in a constellation: you can look at one star and enjoy its beauty,
  but the bigger picture can be seen only when taking in the whole constellation.
  Each poem captures a moment, often seemingly insignificant, and together with all
  the other moments they make up a life and the search for meaning in it. Many texts
  also contain a revelation, a moment that illuminates the situation and propels further
  reflection and/or action. For these reasons, it was difficult to make a selection
  from the book. I feared that by plucking a few texts out of the whole, they would
  not be as meaningful and enjoyable. Eventually, I settled for these two, which well
  exemplify the spirit of <em>Facing Joy Alone</em>.</p>\r\n<p>In “That Original Marines
  T-Shirt”, the poet sees himself mirrored in another: a refugee, an illegal outcast,
  is wearing the shirt that the poet donated to the Catholic charity Caritas. This
  person is in a group of people and looks happy, laughing and joking with his friends.
  He looks like the poet — wearing the poet’s old clothes — but is at the same time
  very different because of his happiness: “another me / but happy.” The poem closes,
  however, on an optimistic note, with the realization that this refugee is showing
  the poet who he can become.</p>\r\n<p>“It Gets Dark Early” depicts a domestic scene
  that feels tired from the outset: what is left of dinner — dirty dishes and half-drunk
  bottles — represent what is left of the couple’s love, a lie compared to the promises
  they used to make to each other. A revelation (“we lied”) propels a realization
  (“the verb to love makes sense only in the present (tense)”) and an action that
  contains a seed of hope (“I reach my hand out”).</p>"
