pid: skull-in-a-graveyard
title: Lebka na hřbitově
transtitle: A Skull in a Graveyard
author: Václav Jaromír Picek
translator: Anthony Burger
poem: "Na hřbitově lebka leží \nV trávě tamo na pokraji, \nZ důlků dvou, kde oči plály,
  \nDvě pomněnky vykvetají; \nVedle nich se na lupínku \nLiliový motýl houpá, \nKvítky
  líbá, již se vznáší, \nJiž se v modru nebes koupá. \n\nRaduj se ty, lebko bílá,
  \nZas máš oči modrojasné, \nZase libě na svět hledíš, \nNežel těla smrti časné;
  \nOna není tak přehrozná, \nJak bojácný duch to soudí, \nOna nový život dává, \nZ
  prachu se zas síla proudí. \n\nA ten motýl? aj to duše \nSvoji schránku navštívila,
  \nA když oči živé našla, \nDo nebe se navrátila. \nNuže, smrti se nebojte, \nTa
  jen nové kvítí sází; \nA co anděl míroplodný \nDuši nad hvězdy provází. "
transpoem: "In a graveyard lies a skull \nIn the grass there at the side \nIn two
  holes where eyes once burned, \nTwo forget-me-nots reside; \nBeside them on a leaf
  \nA lily-white butterfly prepares to fly, \nKissing the flowers, now taking off,
  \nNow swimming in the blue of the sky. \n\nBe happy, you white skull, \nOnce more
  you have clear blue eyes, \nOnce more you gaze kindly at the world, \nDon’t mourn
  a corpse of timely demise; \nIt isn’t as terrible \nAs the scared soul would surmise,
  \nIt brings a new life, \nFrom dust strength can again rise \n\nAnd the butterfly?
  oh the soul \nVisited its skeleton, \nAnd when it found the living eyes, \nIt went
  back to heaven. \nSo do not be afraid of death, \nIt just sows new seeds; \nAnd
  a peace-bringing angel \nthe soul above the stars leads."

  <p>I am drawn to poems partly because of their meaning and partly because of the skill it takes to follow rules in making them. I found Picek’s piece while looking for Czech poetry online, and appreciated the moment it described as well as the rhyme scheme it maintained. I therefore chose to approximate the structure of the poem as best I could in my translation. Naturally, translating to maintain both meaning and rhyme is a balancing act, and leads to sacrifices on certain counts.</p>

  <p>In this poem, the last two lines were the hardest to translate: “A co anděl míroplodný / Duši nad hvězdy provází.” These lines describe an angel that brings peace and leads the soul above the stars. The constraints of rhyming, however, led me to take poetic license and choose a slightly strange word order.</p>

  <p>Another difficult aspect was the somewhat archaic language used. The poem was published in 1851, and as such, much of the language now sounds old-fashioned to a modern reader. I did not attempt to imitate this use of language, as the poem was written in the 1850s for an audience in the 1850s, however a translator could just as easily have decided to attempt to simulate old-fashioned English, as though a reader were reading an 1850s poem in English and looking back from the modern day.</p>

  <p>This poem was the first translation I attempted from Czech into English, and it was a fun challenge. I hope that my translation brings the reader a sense of peace unbroken by any liberties I have taken.</p>

  <p>Václav Jaromír Picek (1812-1869) was a Czech poet in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, known primarily for the inclusion of his poems in a few patriotic songs, including the lyrics to the song “Čechy krásné, Čechy mé” (“Beautiful Bohemia, My Bohemia”). Professionally, he also had a career as a civil servant and judge. He was part of the early Romantic literary movement in the region, and drew inspiration from growing nationalism as well as from other poets of the time. His poems are largely forgotten today, and he is often considered to be a lesser follower of František Ladislav Čelakovský.</p>
  <p>Picek was born in the Austrian Empire in 1812, the son of a farmer. He studied philosophy and law in Prague until 1938, and became the head of the Liblín estate in 1841. He joined the civil service as a lawyer in 1849, and was the editor of the Prague newspaper from 1850-1852. He later worked as a civil servant in Smíchov and Příbram. In his personal life, Picek supported nationalism and education, and often donated to libraries. He became a district judge in Nový Venátky in 1868, and died there in 1869.</p>
tbio: "<p>Anthony Burger graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor’s
  degree in linguistics, and has a soft spot for Slavic languages. He grew up speaking
  Czech at home, but never significantly interacted with Czech literature until college.
  After taking a course on German literature at Penn and discovering the joy of poetry,
  he started looking for poems in Czech online — Anthony felt that he was long overdue
  in exploring the literature of his second homeland. Picek’s poem about a skull in
  a graveyard reminds him of my grandmother’s small town, where the graveyard is indeed
  the home of many flowers, and quite honestly a quaint place to walk around. Fortunately,
  in all the times he's visited, he's never come across a human skull there. </p>"
