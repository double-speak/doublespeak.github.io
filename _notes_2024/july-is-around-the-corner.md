poem: |-
  性别的诞生不远
  爱情不远————马鼻子下
  湖泊含盐


  因此青海湖不远
  湖畔一捆捆蜂箱
  使我显得凄凄迷人
  青草开满鲜花。


  青海湖上
  我的孤独如天堂的马匹
  (因此 天堂的马匹不远)


  我就是那个情种： 诗中吟唱的野花
  天堂的马肚子里唯一含毒的野花
  (青海湖 请熄灭我的爱情！)


  野花青梗不远 医箱内古老姓氏不远
  (其他的浪子 治好了疾病
  已回原籍 我这就想去见你们)


  因此爬山涉水死亡不远
  骨骼挂遍我身体
  如同蓝色水上的树枝


  啊！ 青海湖 暮色苍茫的水面
  一切如在眼前！


  只有五月生命的鸟群早已飞去
  只有饮我宝石的头一只鸟早已飞去
  只剩下青海湖 这宝石的尸体
  暮色苍茫的水面
transpoem: "July is around the corner\nClose to the birth of gender\nLove is close---beneath
  the horse’s nose\nQinghai Lake is salty \nThus Qinghai Lake is close\nBundles of
  beehives alongside the lake\nGrievous I appear\nGreen grass suffused with flowers
  \n\nOn Qinghai Lake\nmy loneliness is like a horse in heaven\n(Thus the horse in
  Heaven is not far away)\nI am the seed of love: the wildflower being chanted in
  poems,\nthe only toxic flower in the heaven's horse's belly\n(Qinghai Lake, please
  quench my love's flame)\nI am still in love with her\nWith no herbs to heal\n(Other
  prodigal men with wounds of love found solace for their pain, and returned to their
  birthplace, I wish to meet you）\nThus trudging across mountains and streams, death
  is around the corner \nBones adorn my body, like branches floating on blue water,\nAll
  flash before my eyes\nBirds who stay here for only five months flew away long ago\nOnly
  the first bird that sipped from my flow flew away long ago\nOnly Qinghai Lake remains,
  this gem-like corpse\nOn twilit waters, reflections aglow"
note: |-
  <p>Haizi wrote “July is around the corner” in 1986. In this love poem, Haizi utilizes Qinghai Lake as a confidant and employs subtle imagery like horses and fresh blooms to convey his profound sense of solitude and the excruciating pain of lost love.</p>
  <p>One of the most challenging aspects of this translation is in the line, “I am still in love with you / With no herbs to heal.” A direct translation from the original text would be, “Wildflowers and green stems are not far away, ancient last names in the medical chest are not far.” However, such a rendering appears quite vague. The Chinese pronunciation of “green stems” is a homophone for <span lang=“zh”>情根</span> (<em>qing gen</em>), which conveys the enduring nature of the poet’s faithful love. It likens this steadfast love to the root and stem of a plant, implying that this unwavering love has been deeply rooted in the poet's heart.. Therefore, I translated it as “I am still in love with you,” emphasizing such deep-rooted affection. “Ancient last names in the medical chest are not far” shows the author’s search for a remedy for his wounds of love. This is because many Chinese herbal medicine names include common surnames. “Ancient last names” thus symbolize various herbs. Although “ancient last names” are “not far,” they are still unattainable, implying that the author’s suffering is actually incurable. Signifying the poet’s profound emotional pain, I chose to translate this line as “with no herbs to heal.”</p>
  <p>Lastly, in the original poem, the term <span lang=“zh”>情种</span> (<em>qing zhong</em>) literally translates to “the love seed.” However, within the Chinese cultural context, <span lang=“zh”>情种</span> refers to an individual deeply enamored of someone. This phrase describes love as a seed rooted in one’s heart. Finding no equivalent in English, I chose to translate <span lang=“zh”>情种</span> as “the seed of love.”</p>
abio: "<p>Zha Haishen, who wrote under the pen name Hai Zi, was born in Anhui Province
  (China) on March 24, 1964. He spent his childhood in rural China during the Cultural
  Revolution. In 1979, he enrolled in Peking University at the age of 15. He began
  writing as a student in the early 1980s. After graduation, he worked at China University
  of Political Science and Law. From what he felt was an extremely dull environment
  at the university, Hai Zi sent his poems to different newspapers and presses, but
  his works were rarely accepted for publication. He remained unknown to the general
  audience until he passed away in 1989.</p>"
