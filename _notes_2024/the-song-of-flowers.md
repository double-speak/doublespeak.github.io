poem: |-
  Alavar keru al Djo
  A el Djo grande i abastadu
  Ke krija para ombri
  De mučas maneras de floris.
  I di todas las mižoris
  Es la maskerini
  Sovri todu es de alavar
  A el Djo el grande.

  Salto la roza i dišu:
  Todus kedin a un ladu
  A mi mi toka a alavar
  Al Djo grande i abastado.
  Ki di mi kitan azeti
  I tanbjen asukri rozadu.
  I in agua so alavada
  Los ožos hazinus si lavan di mi
  Sovri todu es di alavar
  Al Djo el grande.

  Arespondijo la klavinjina
  Mas grandis son mi famas
  Jo so roza di novijas
  I mi jevan in las plantas.
  I mi mandan pur prizenti
  A todas las lindas damas.
  Mi kerin komu sus almas
  Todas las novijas se adoran kon mi.
  Sovri di todu es di alavar
  Al Djo el grande.

  Salto la ruda i dišo
  Grandes son la mis famas
  Jo so roza di paridas
  Me teten en sus kamas.
  I todo el ožo malo
  Lo kemo kon las mis plantas
  Le guardo la su alma.
  Del ke me jeva a mi.
transpoem: "I wish to praise God,\nOur Great God Almighty\nWho created for people\nMany
  kinds of flowers.\nAnd among all, the best\nIs the lily flower.\nAbove all we must
  praise\nOur Great God.\n \nThe rose sprang up and said:\n“All of you step aside.\nIt
  is my turn to praise\nOur Great God Almighty,\nFor they press oil from me\nAnd also
  make rose jam,\nAnd when dissolved I’m praised.\nThey rinse their sore eyes with
  me.\nAbove all we must praise\nOur Great God.”\n \nThe carnation responded:\n“Great
  is my renown.\nI am the rose of brides.\nThey carry me in bunches.\nThey send me
  as presents\nTo all the lovely ladies.\nThey love me like their souls.\nAll the
  brides adorn themselves with me.\nAbove all we must praise\nOur Great God.”\n \nThe
  rue sprang up and said:\n“Great is my renown.\nI am the rose of new mothers.\nThey
  suck on me in their beds,\nAnd all the evil eyes\nI burn with my bunches.\nI guard
  the soul of those\nWho carry me on them.”"
note: |-
  <p>I do not know exactly why this <em>cantica</em> spoke to me. It seems like it sprang to my attention like its characters, the gently competing plants. I have attempted to reproduce some of the delicate balance of tone, the sense of importance of the rose, carnation, and rue tempered by their joint praise of the Creator. The echoes became important to keep since they highlight the individual strengths of the speakers and fold them into the larger structure of God’s creation and the assembled <em>cantica</em> itself: “It is my turn to praise.../ I am praised”; “Great is my renown./ I am the rose of…”; “They love me like their souls./… I guard their soul.” While I could not maintain the inconsistent yet fascinating rhyming sequence (likely resulting from the composite nature of the <em>cantica</em>), I included some alliteration and assonance to give coherence and delicacy to the text. Incidentally, the letter <em>r</em> occurs in almost every line of my rendition.</p>
  <p>The plants argue for their centrality in human lives as they appear in crucial life events like courting, wedding, and childbirth. They can heal sore eyes and protect from the evil eye. The rose — entering like a mighty queen with the direction “All of you step aside” (“Todus kedin a un ladu,” literally “All [of you] stay on one side”) – underlines her role in cosmetics and cuisine. Nehama-Cantera’s Judeo-Spanish/French dictionary confirms that the rue protects against the evil eye according to Sephardic folk beliefs, adorning women in childbirth and children to ensure their health; our present-day encyclopedias, however, warn that the plant in large doses can act as an abortifacient, damage liver, and even lead to death.</p>

  <p>* The text comes from Samuel M. Elazar’s <em>El romancero judeo-español (romances y otras poesías)</em> (Sarajevo, 1987; reprinted Paris, 2008). Judeo-Spanish is here written using the Serbo-Croatian/Croato-Serbian Roman alphabet: č = ch; j = y; nj = ñ; š = sh; ž = zh (or j in French).</p>
  <p>In his endnotes, Samuel Elazar reports that he compiled “Cantica de Floris” from folk-song fragments he received from Gina Finci and Rikica Gottesman and those he found in the collection of Nina Škoro-Levi, which had probably been recorded by her sister, the foremost Bosnian Sephardic woman intellectual, poet, and playwright Laura Papo Bohoreta (1892-1942).</p>
  <p>Born in Gračanica and living in Sarajevo for most of his life, Elazar (1902-1989) was a pharmacist by training with a strong interest in art, history, and philosophy. During World War II, he hid with his family in Zenica where he worked as a pharmacist for a mine; the rest of his and his wife’s family perished in the Holocaust. After his retirement, he dedicated himself to collecting and preserving oral tradition in his mother tongue, Judeo-Spanish. Elazar’s continuous study of medicinal plants, attested in his scientific publications, must have inspired him to assemble “Cantica de Floris.”</p>
