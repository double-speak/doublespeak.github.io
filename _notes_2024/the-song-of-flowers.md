poem: "Alavar keru al Djo\r\nA el Djo grande i abastadu\r\nKe krija para ombri\r\nDe
  mučas maneras de floris.\r\nI di todas las mižoris\r\nEs la maskerini\r\nSovri todu
  es de alavar\r\nA el Djo el grande.\r\n\r\nSalto la roza i dišu:\r\nTodus kedin
  a un ladu\r\nA mi mi toka a alavar\r\nAl Djo grande i abastado.\r\nKi di mi kitan
  azeti\r\nI tanbjen asukri rozadu.\r\nI in agua so alavada\r\nLos ožos hazinus si
  lavan di mi\r\nSovri todu es di alavar\r\nAl Djo el grande.\r\n\r\nArespondijo la
  klavinjina\r\nMas grandis son mi famas\r\nJo so roza di novijas\r\nI mi jevan in
  las plantas.\r\nI mi mandan pur prizenti\r\nA todas las lindas damas.\r\nMi kerin
  komu sus almas\r\nTodas las novijas se adoran kon mi.\r\nSovri di todu es di alavar\r\nAl
  Djo el grande.\r\n\r\nSalto la ruda i dišo\r\nGrandes son la mis famas\r\nJo so
  roza di paridas\r\nMe teten en sus kamas.\r\nI todo el ožo malo\r\nLo kemo kon las
  mis plantas\r\nLe guardo la su alma.\r\nDel ke me jeva a mi."
transpoem: "I wish to praise God,\r\nOur Great God Almighty\r\nWho created for people\r\nMany
  kinds of flowers.\r\nAnd among all, the best\r\nIs the lily flower.\r\nAbove all
  we must praise\r\nOur Great God.\r\n \r\nThe rose sprang up and said:\r\n“All of
  you step aside.\r\nIt is my turn to praise\r\nOur Great God Almighty,\r\nFor they
  press oil from me\r\nAnd also make rose jam,\r\nAnd when dissolved I’m praised.\r\nThey
  rinse their sore eyes with me.\r\nAbove all we must praise\r\nOur Great God.”\r\n
  \r\nThe carnation responded:\r\n“Great is my renown.\r\nI am the rose of brides.\r\nThey
  carry me in bunches.\r\nThey send me as presents\r\nTo all the lovely ladies.\r\nThey
  love me like their souls.\r\nAll the brides adorn themselves with me.\r\nAbove all
  we must praise\r\nOur Great God.”\r\n \r\nThe rue sprang up and said:\r\n“Great
  is my renown.\r\nI am the rose of new mothers.\r\nThey suck on me in their beds,\r\nAnd
  all the evil eyes\r\nI burn with my bunches.\r\nI guard the soul of those\r\nWho
  carry me on them.”"
note: "<p>I do not know exactly why this <em>cantica</em> spoke to me. It seems like
  it sprang to my attention like its characters, the gently competing plants. I have
  attempted to reproduce some of the delicate balance of tone, the sense of importance
  of the rose, carnation, and rue tempered by their joint praise of the Creator. The
  echoes became important to keep since they highlight the individual strengths of
  the speakers and fold them into the larger structure of God’s creation and the assembled
  <em>cantica</em> itself: “It is my turn to praise.../ I am praised”; “Great is my
  renown./ I am the rose of…”; “They love me like their souls./… I guard their soul.”
  While I could not maintain the inconsistent yet fascinating rhyming sequence (likely
  resulting from the composite nature of the <em>cantica</em>), I included some alliteration
  and assonance to give coherence and delicacy to the text. Incidentally, the letter
  <em>r</em> occurs in almost every line of my rendition.</p>\r\n<p>The plants argue
  for their centrality in human lives as they appear in crucial life events like courting,
  wedding, and childbirth. They can heal sore eyes and protect from the evil eye.
  The rose — entering like a mighty queen with the direction “All of you step aside”
  (“Todus kedin a un ladu,” literally “All [of you] stay on one side”) – underlines
  her role in cosmetics and cuisine. Nehama-Cantera’s Judeo-Spanish/French dictionary
  confirms that the rue protects against the evil eye according to Sephardic folk
  beliefs, adorning women in childbirth and children to ensure their health; our present-day
  encyclopedias, however, warn that the plant in large doses can act as an abortifacient,
  damage liver, and even lead to death.</p>"
abio: "<p>* The text comes from Samuel M. Elazar’s <em>El romancero judeo-español
  (romances y otras poesías)</em> (Sarajevo, 1987; reprinted Paris, 2008). Judeo-Spanish
  is here written using the Serbo-Croatian/Croato-Serbian Roman alphabet: č = ch;
  j = y; nj = ñ; š = sh; ž = zh (or j in French).</p>\r\n<p>In his endnotes, Samuel
  Elazar reports that he compiled “Cantica de Floris” from folk-song fragments he
  received from Gina Finci and Rikica Gottesman and those he found in the collection
  of Nina Škoro-Levi, which had probably been recorded by her sister, the foremost
  Bosnian Sephardic woman intellectual, poet, and playwright Laura Papo Bohoreta (1892-1942).</p>\r\n<p>Born
  in Gračanica and living in Sarajevo for most of his life, Elazar (1902-1989) was
  a pharmacist by training with a strong interest in art, history, and philosophy.
  During World War II, he hid with his family in Zenica where he worked as a pharmacist
  for a mine; the rest of his and his wife’s family perished in the Holocaust. After
  his retirement, he dedicated himself to collecting and preserving oral tradition
  in his mother tongue, Judeo-Spanish. Elazar’s continuous study of medicinal plants,
  attested in his scientific publications, must have inspired him to assemble “Cantica
  de Floris.”</p>"
