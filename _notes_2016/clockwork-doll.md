title: בובה ממוכנת
transtitle: Clockwork Doll
author: Dahlia Ravikovitch
translator: Alexandra Pierson
poem: "בלילה הזה הייתי בובה ממוכנת \n,ופניתי ימינה ושמאלה, לכל העברים \nונפלתי אפיים
  ארצה ונישברתי לשברים \n.וניסו לאחות את שברי ביד מאומנת \n\nואחר כך שבתי להיות בובה
  מתוקנת \n,וכל מנהגי היה שקול וצייתני \nאולם אז כבר הייתי בובה מסוג שני \n.כמו זמורה
  חבולה שהיא עוד אחוזה בקנוקנת\n\nואחר כך הלכתי לרקוד בנשף המחולות \nאך הניחו אותי
  בחברת חתולים וכלבים \n.ואלו כל צעדי היו מדודים וקצובים \n\nוהיה לי שיער זהב ועיניים
  כחולות \nוהיתה לי שימלה מצבע פרחים שבגן \n.והיה לי כובע של קש עם קישוט דובדבן"
transpoem: |-
  And on that night I dressed as a clockwork doll
  turned to the right and left, twirled for all
  until the crash cracked my face,
  and they ran to piece me back into place.

  Then, again, I was a clockwork doll
  and I was polite and poised, in spite
  of becoming a very different doll that night —
  a splintered stem veiled from sunlight.

  Still I dreamed to dance at the ball,
  but they saw I was weak, just scraps of a shawl,
  left me in a pile of candles by the cats and dogs
  though my feet could still tap the songs.

  My hair was golden, my eyes the ocean
  my dress stolen from flowers in the garden
  its ruffles carrying a cherry now forgotten.
note: |-
  <p>In translating “Clockwork Doll,” I wanted to keep the original sonnet’s essential theme of losing oneself, along with its beautiful imagery. In order to heighten the mythical and fantastical elements of the poem, I chose to add some internal rhyme in place of the original’s end rhymes, especially in the last stanza of the work. I also wished to make a few of the images new. Instead of literally translating that the doll’s hat is decorated with a cherry, I chose to say that the doll has a cherry in its dress. To me, a dress carrying “a cherry” in “its ruffles” expresses a piece of humanity the doll still has tucked away somewhere.</p>
  <p>I think this poem is incredibly relevant to today’s world, where we can all at times feel like clockwork dolls, moving through the motions and sometimes falling on our faces.</p>
