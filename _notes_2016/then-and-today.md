  “Put out the light”

                 “What are you sitting on?”

  “It must be past ten o’clock”

                 “Then oh! all night the light kept burning.
  Kept on burning.”

  “Now what are you getting enraged about?”

  “Alas, then it used to be said that the darkness might swallow —
  and now the light truly comes to devour.”
