title: Le Balcon
transtitle: Balcony
author: Charles Baudelaire
translator: Shilpa Saravanan
poem: |-
  Mère des souvenirs, maîtresse des maîtresses,
  Ô toi, tous mes plaisirs! ô toi, tous mes devoirs!
  Tu te rappelleras la beauté des caresses,
  La douceur du foyer et le charme des soirs,
  Mère des souvenirs, maîtresse des maîtresses!

  Les soirs illuminés par l’ardeur du charbon,
  Et les soirs au balcon, voilés de vapeurs roses.
  Que ton sein m’était doux! que ton coeur m’était bon!
  Nous avons dit souvent d’impérissables choses
  Les soirs illuminés par l’ardeur du charbon.

  Que les soleils sont beaux dans les chaudes soirées!
  Que l’espace est profond! que le coeur est puissant!
  En me penchant vers toi, reine des adorées,
  Je croyais respirer le parfum de ton sang.
  Que les soleils sont beaux dans les chaudes soirées!

  La nuit s’épaississait ainsi qu’une cloison,
  Et mes yeux dans le noir devinaient tes prunelles,
  Et je buvais ton souffle, ô douceur! ô poison!
  Et tes pieds s’endormaient dans mes mains fraternelles.
  La nuit s’épaississait ainsi qu’une cloison.

  Je sais l’art d’évoquer les minutes heureuses,
  Et revis mon passé blotti dans tes genoux.
  Car à quoi bon chercher tes beautés langoureuses
  Ailleurs qu’en ton cher corps et qu’en ton coeur si doux?
  Je sais l’art d’évoquer les minutes heureuses!

  Ces serments, ces parfums, ces baisers infinis,
  Renaîtront-ils d’un gouffre interdit à nos sondes,
  Comme montent au ciel les soleils rajeunis
  Après s’être lavés au fond des mers profondes?
  — Ô serments! ô parfums! ô baisers infinis!
transpoem: |-
  Mother of memories, mistress of mistresses,
  All my pleasures, all my obligations —
  You will remember these touches,
  That foyer, those charmed nights.
  Mother of memories, mistress of mistresses.

  We’d light the nights with burning coals.
  Nights on the balcony, drenched in roses:
  You were so sweet, your heart so open,
  We often told each other imperishable things.
  And we’d light the nights with burning coals.

  The sun’s beautiful on a summer’s evening.
  The stars are inscrutable, and so is the heart;
  As I bent to kiss you, my love of all loves,
  I think I smelled your blood.
  The sun’s beautiful on a summer’s evening.

  The darkness continued to deepen.
  My eyes always found yours regardless:
  I’d drink in your breaths, tasty poisons,
  And your feet would fall asleep in my hands.
  And the darkness continued to deepen.

  There is an art to remembrance.
  Lying in your lap, I can relive the past;
  Why would I look for your languid beauty
  Anywhere but your body, your warm heart?
  I know the art of remembrance!

  These promises, perfumes, infinite kisses,
  Won’t they rise out of foreign waters —
  Like suns reborn, scaling the horizon
  After having bathed in the depths?
  Promises, perfumes, kisses infinite.
note: |-
  <p>I found “Le balcon” when I found the line “we often told each other imperishable things” quoted in an essay — not as part of the Baudelaire poem, but as having been inscribed in an unrelated poetry collection gifted from one artist to another almost a century ago. In any other context, I might’ve found the line a bit too heady, a bit too into itself, but what struck me was that someone had quoted the line to express (directly) to a loved one the sentiments contained in it. I couldn’t get that interaction out of my head for days, and so my own translation began with (and centers on) this particular line.</p>
  <p>The line “we often told each other imperishable things” is very close to the original French, but I took certain liberties with the rest of the translation. I tried to hew close to (what I feel) is the character of the love the poem describes — it’s by no means a singular, once-in-a-lifetime love, but it’s a love that manages to be as earthy as it is sweet — many translations lose sight of its earthiness — and despite its transience, it’s one worth remembering. This necessitated the use of certain phrases that have a more animalistic connotation in English (for example, “smelled your blood” and “tasty poisons”) than they do in the original, and a switch from the passive to the active voice in two stanzas that emphasizes the fact that the lovers are entirely separate beings who <em>choose</em> to come together on this balcony.</p>
abio: "<p>Charles Baudelaire was born in 1821 in Paris. Often referred to as a <em>poéte
  maudit</em>, a “cursed poet,” Baudelaire was known for his work in translating Edgar
  Allan Poe’s poetry from English to French as well as for his originality in style.
  He is credited with coining the term “modernity” to refer to the fleeting quality
  of life in an urban city, and believed that art must capture those sentiments. His
  most famous work is <em>Les fleurs du mal</em> (<em>The Flowers of Evil</em>), a
  collection of French poetry that led to his prosecution for indecency and religious
  immorality due to references to the devil as well as the principle themes of sex
  and death. However, Baudelaire’s perseverance lead to the collection being recognized
  as revolutionary, and it stands among the most famous collections of French poetry
  today. Baudelaire’s skills as a poet, prose author and translator have garnered
  him much fame and respect, and though he is not as well known as other French contemporaries
  of his time, he has most certainly earned his place in the scope of global literature.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Shilpa Saravanan is a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania studying
  linguistics and computer science. Her interest in translation arose from several
  valiant attempts to figure out what made a so-called bad translation of Thomas Mann’s
  <em>Buddenbrooks</em> bad.</p>"
