poem: " וְרָאִיתִי אֲנִי אֶת דִּמְעַת הָעֲשׁוּקִים \n.הוֹלֶכֶת וּנְמוֹגָה עַל לֶחְיָם\nוְרֵיחַ
  חַרְצִיּוֹת עָלָה מִן הַבְּקָעוֹת \n.עִם רֵיחַ שִׁטָּה רַעֲנָן \nוּמֵי נְחָלִים
  הִתְנַפְּצוּ עַל אֲבָנִים \n.בְּגַל שֶׁל שִׂמְחָה לְחִנָּם \nוְעַל שְׂפַת הַכִּנֶּרֶת
  הָיוּ מִתְרַחֲצִים \n.וְרוּחַ לֹא נָשַׁב עַל הַיָּם \nוְלֹא הָיָה מִי שֶׁיֵּלֵךְ
  עַל הַגַּלִּים \n.רַק הָמוֹן סִירוֹת וּמִשְׂחָקִים \n.וְרָאִיתִי אֶת דִּמְעַת הָעֲשׁוּקִים
  \  \nמִי שֶׁיִּרְצֶה לָקַחַת מִן הָאוֹר הָאוֹר \n.הוּא נַחֲלָתוֹ \nוְכָל אִישׁ יִהְיֶה
  חָפְשִׁי כְּמוֹ עָגוּר \n,לָלֶכֶת וְלָבוֹא \nמִלְּבַד אֶחָד \n.שֶׁהוּא שֶׁלִּי \nוְטוֹב
  לָעֵינַיִם לִרְאוֹת אֶת הָאוֹר \nוּמֵי הַנָּהָר כֹּה חָמִים וּמְתוּקִים וְ\nדִמְעַת
  הָעֲשׁוּקִים \n.מָרָה \n"
transpoem: "and I have seen the tears of the oppressed \ndissolving drop by drop on
  their cheeks —\nand the scent of chrysanthemums rose fresh from the valleys\nwith
  the fragrance of acacia, opening, awake\nand seas of streams shattered themselves
  upon rocks\nin a wave born from unrooted joy —  \nand on the shore of the Galilee
  there were bathers \nand no spirit blew across the sea\nand nobody walked upon the
  waves,\nonly a tumult of boats, scouting and playing.\n\nand I will have seen the
  tears of the oppressor – \nif you wish for a piece of Light, the light\nis your
  own.\nand each shall be free as a crane\nto go and to come,\napart from the one\nwho’s
  my own.\nand it is good for eyes to behold the light\nand the stream of the sea
  is so warm and sweet and\nthe tears of oppression\nso bitter."
note: |-
  <p>“all Your breakers and Your waves” was originally written in Hebrew by Dahlia Ravikovitch, an Israeli poet and peace activist born in 1936. At the time that Ravikovitch wrote, much of Israeli poetry was written in a mix of Biblical and Modern Hebrew, which meant that although I know no Modern Hebrew, the amount of Biblical Hebrew I’ve learned in the past two years gave me strong basis for understanding the poem.</p>
  <p>In my translation, I chose to lift up ambiguities created by considering this text from the viewpoint of Biblical, rather than Modern Hebrew. The first is an ambiguity behind the word <span lang="he">העשוקים</span>, which in Modern Hebrew translates more directly to “the oppressed,” but in Biblical Hebrew can also simply mean “oppression.” At around the time I first read this poem, I began working with an activist organization in which we talked about how oppression works as a cycle in which oppressors dehumanize the oppressed and, in doing so, become dehumanized themselves, while those who have experienced oppression may more easily become oppressors. With this cycle in mind, I chose to translate this word differently each of the three times it appears in this poem — first as oppressed, then as oppressor, and lastly as oppression. As long as oppression exists, no one on any point of the spectrum can be fully human.  The other ambiguity centered around the tense of the verb in the first line of each stanza. In Biblical Hebrew, but not Modern Hebrew, verbs that begin with the prefix “and” oddly switch tense from past to future or vice-versa. This poem is written in the past tense, but because the two lines in question begin with “and,” to a reader of Biblical Hebrew, the tense would seem to be future. I chose to use both tenses, pairing the future, which to me communicates a prophetic yearning, with the translation of <span lang="he">העשוקים</span> as “oppressor” because although we may recognize and mourn oppression thousands of times across history, what will bring us true redemption will be reckoning with the oppressor and rehumanizing both sides.</p>
abio: '<p>Dahlia Ravikovitch (<span lang="he">דליה רביקוביץ</span>)was born in Ramat
  Gan, Israel, in 1936 and died in Tel Aviv, in 2005. She is one of the most well-known
  contemporary Israeli poets, peace activists, and translators, her primary language
  being Hebrew. Losing her father at an early age, she spent time in a <em>kibbutz</em>
  and then at several foster homes. She published her first book of poetry in 1959,
  called <em>The Love of an Orange</em>. Throughout her lifetime, she published ten
  volumes of poetry, which was translated into twenty-three languages. She has also
  translated the works of W.B. Yeats, T.S. Eliot, and Edgar Allan Poe into Hebrew.
  Many of her poems have been set to song and are well-known radio favorites in Israel.</p>

tbio: "<p>Mira Revesz is a senior majoring in Adolescent Identity Development at Swarthmore
  College. She fell in love with poetry when she first read Edna St. Vincent Millay’s
  work at age thirteen. At age nineteen, she alarmed surrounding passengers on a plane
  when she cried for an hour after reading that Millay died at the end of her biography
  (not a surprise ending). Mira entered the wild and contentious world of translation
  through Professor Taije Silverman's Translation of Poetry course, which was the
  best gateway she could have hoped for.</p>"
