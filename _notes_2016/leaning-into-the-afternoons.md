pid: leaning-into-the-afternoons
title: Poema XVII
transtitle: Leaning Into the Afternoons
author: Pablo Neruda
translator: Naomi Bernstein
poem: "Inclinado en las tardes tiro mis tristes redes \na tus ojos oceánicos. \n \nAllí
  se estira y arde en la más alta hoguera\nmi soledad que da vueltas los brazos como
  un náufrago \n \nHago rojas señales sobre tus ojos ausentes\nque olean como el mar
  a la orilla de un faro. \n \nSólo guardas tinieblas, hembra distante y mía, \nde
  tu mirada emerge a veces la costa del espanto. \n \nInclinado a las tardes echo
  mis tristes redes \na ese mar que sacude tus ojos oceánicos. \n \nLos pájaros nocturnos
  picotean las primeras estrellas \nque centellean como mi alma cuando te amo. \n
  \nGalopa la noche en su yegua sombría\ndesparramando espigas azules sobre el campo."
transpoem: "Leaning into the afternoons I toss my weary nets\nto your eyes, they are
  oceans. \n \nThere the nets stretch and flare in a tall fire,\nmy loneliness thrashes
  with arms like a man drowning.\n \nI send red signals toward your absent eyes\nthat
  drift like the sea to the shore of the lighthouse.\n \nBut you guard only darkness,
  distant girl of mine,\nand from your gaze rises a shore of fear sometimes.\n \nLeaning
  into the afternoons I toss my weary nets\nto this sea that shakes your eyes, they
  are oceans.\n \nThe nocturnal birds peck the first stars\nthat shine like my soul
  when I love you.\n \nThe night gallops on its mare of shadow\nscattering blue wheat
  over the field."

  <p>After immersing myself in Pablo Neruda’s <em>Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair</em>, my outlook on the state of modern love became exceedingly cynical. Neruda was twenty years old when he wrote his book of love poems, and in it he demonstrates a respect and passion for women that most contemporary men won’t reach in a lifetime. I translated Neruda to combat “locker room banter” and the harmful rhetoric toward women that has been normalized in our society.</p>
  <p>My goal was to maintain a level of fluidity here that will inevitably fail in comparison to Neruda’s rhythm. Spanish can roll in a way that English doesn’t, but it was essential to me that the language I chose be as smooth as a net tossed over the ocean. This was especially difficult because part of the smoothness of Spanish comes from the order in which sentences are arranged; it’s vastly different from English syntax. I’m proud of the way this translation reads within the confines of the English language.</p>
abio: "<p>Pablo Neruda was an internationally renowned Chilean poet and politician.
  He was born in 1904 in Parral, Chile, and he wrote in his native Spanish. Especially
  prolific, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971. His strong commitment
  to the Communist Party had significant influence on his poetry, though he wrote
  about a variety of subjects, from ordinary human existence and love to world events.
  His style drew on surrealism, political manifestos, and historical epics.  Colombian
  novelist Gabriel García Márquez described Neruda as “the greatest poet of the twentieth
  century in any language.”</p>"
tbio: "<p>Naomi Bernstein is a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying
  English and creative writing. She was recently honored with the Ezra Pound Award
  for her translation of Gabriel Mistral’s “Set Free” and she was awarded third place
  for the Judy Lee Award for Dramatic Writing for her short play, <em>Virtual Snow</em>.</p>"
