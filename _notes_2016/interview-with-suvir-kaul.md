note: "<p>[<em>Editor’s Note: Suvir Kaul is the A.M. Rosenthal Professor of English
  at the University of Pennsylvania as well as the author of four books, including
  most recently </em>Of Garden and Graves<em>[1], a collection of his essays on the
  conflict in Kashmir as well as poems that Kaul has translated into English.</p>\n<p>First
  published in local journals, the book’s poems were all written by authors — Hindu
  and Muslim alike — who at some point lived in Kashmir. They detail the conflict’s
  effects in the most intimate of ways, as their words are those of people who have
  directly suffered the consequences. Kashmir refers to the northernmost territories
  of India, the Himalayan regions that make up the border between India and Pakistan,
  and some parts of the Indo-Chinese border. India and Pakistan have been engaging
  in brutal, though sporadic, warfare since 1947, the year of Indian independence,
  over this land. Pakistan argues for control since Kashmir is an area of Muslim majority,
  while India claims that Pakistan has supported separatist groups fighting against
  government control.</p>\n<p>The issue extends beyond politics, as Hindus and Muslims
  alike live in fear, not of each other but of military forces from both governments
  that crack down on their respective territories. They once lived in harmony and
  they now distrust each other. The only bridge between these two communities, these
  two countries, is their shared pain and the common language. </em>Of Gardens and
  Graves<em> includes classical forms, such as the </em>ghazal<em> and the </em>nazm<em>[2],
  as well as poems following the more spontaneous forms of the poet’s desire. These
  translations explore the chaos and anxieties that Kashmiri citizens face via the
  structure and artistry of poetry.</p>\n<p></em>DoubleSpeak<em> was lucky enough
  to talk with Professor Kaul about his work, as well as the larger global scope of
  translation. Below is a transcript of our conversation followed by two excerpts
  from </em>Of Gardens and Graves<em>.</em>]</p>\n<p><b>Shailly Pandey:</b> Why did
  you specifically choose poems written in Kashmiri? Is it because the poems you were
  looking for just happened to be written in it, or because Kashmiri is starting to
  die out?</p>\n<p><b>Suvir Kaul:</b> Kashmiri is not dying at all, but it does not
  receive the kind of attention reserved for other major languages in India. But there
  is a reason why I only wanted Kashmiri poems in this book. There is lots of Urdu
  poetry in Kashmir. Urdu is the state language; it is the language taught in schools.
  Kashmiri [wasn’t] taught in school until very recently. It used to be the language
  of the home, of domesticity, of colloquialism on the street, not the official language.</p>\n<p>Kashmiri
  is [also] a very idiomatic language. The idiom of spoken Kashmiri, even if you follow
  a casual street conversation, is particularly clever and inventive. Some of that
  is available in the poetry. It’s also a more intimate language. When someone in
  Kashmir wants to make a formal or important point, they will switch to Urdu. But
  if they’re just talking about the way they feel, within the family, between parents
  and children, they’ll be speaking Kashmiri. And it’s that intimacy that I find very
  attractive. Many of my friends said to me, “Here, these are wonderful poems, and
  they’re all in Urdu,” and I said no, this is a collection of Kashmiri poems.</p>\n<p><b>Pandey:</b>
  Originally, was this meant to be a book of translation or a book of essays?</p>\n<p><b>Kaul:</b>
  This didn’t begin as a project in translation of poetry at all. I kept writing longer,
  quasi-journalistic think-pieces about what I was seeing there in visits to my ancestral
  home in Srinagar. This wasn’t the Kashmir of my childhood. This wasn’t the Kashmir
  that most people around me, Hindu or Muslim, understood. They suffered it, but they
  didn’t understand it. So I started to write articles in my own effort to educate
  myself: What allowed us to get to this point? But I was still not tapping into something
  I might be able to do that other journalists or political observers would not be
  able to do. And that really is to try and generate an archive of poetry, and to
  use my skills as a literary critic, which is what I am by training, to say to people
  who pay attention only to political developments that if you really want to understand
  political feelings, it’s not only through formal politics alone that you understand
  them, but it’s also by turning to poetry, to cultural production. That’s what lies
  behind the addition of these poems to this project.</p>\n<p>In my introduction,
  I speak about the poem “Corpse” by Shabir “Azar.” It’s an English translation of
  an Urdu poem, published in <em>Uzma Weekly</em>, a local Kashmiri newspaper. In
  2014, there were these floods in Kashmir. I lost the Urdu original I had photocopied,
  and I have not been able to find it since, because the newspaper is no longer published
  and all other places I thought I would find it don’t have a copy either, either
  because of the flood or because of bad housekeeping. So the original Urdu from which
  I have translated, I no longer have. This is just one of the ironies of translating
  poems from Kashmir.</p>\n<p>The other irony is that, when I began this project,
  I kept telling my friends that I was the wrong person to do it because my Kashmiri
  really isn’t good enough. But then I realized that more important than language
  facility was a desire peculiar to translation, and here I’ll use the phrase that
  is often bandied about in literary criticism: inhabiting the space of the other
  — the space of the other language, the other poet, etc., and doing so empathetically.
  As a matter of fact, you will not get any two Kashmiris to agree on what they think
  a single line of poetry means. It’s not literal meaning, so there will be a lot
  of discussion. But the discussion is the point. That’s when you begin to understand
  the manifold resources of poetic language, the way it allows people to find elements
  of themselves, their own experiences, their own differences in that space. That,
  for me, is what it means to think of translation not just simply as an individual
  encounter with language, but as a cultural engagement with language.</p>\n<p><b>Pandey:</b>
  How did the fact that these originals were so susceptible to being lost forever
  change your process of first finding and then translating them, knowing that you’re
  preserving something that would have otherwise vanished?</p>\n<p><b>Kaul:</b> I
  should note that not all of the journals or newspapers that these poems were published
  in will disappear like issues of low-circulation newspapers do, but it is true that
  publishing these poems is a way of preserving them and giving them new life in a
  second language. That’s the responsibility I learned to believe in. I knew I couldn’t
  include more than twenty-five or thirty poems in a book like this. So I was always
  looking for poems that I would think of as representative in some ways. I read and
  did drafts of a great many more poems than these, perhaps around one hundred and
  twenty, till I got to these poems. And so I suppose the choices are comparatively
  opportunistic; there’s not anything that represents a rock-solid archive. It’s a
  combing through elements.</p>\n<p>One of the poems I discuss here, available only
  in my English translation, was actually brought to me on a scrap of paper. And that
  was because the person who wrote it is in jail. He’s never going to be publishing
  the poem, but he wrote it. For me, that is weightier than the kind of ephemeral
  quality suggested by a person in jail writing on scraps of paper and then passing
  it on to his brother who passed it on to a friend who passed it on to me because
  he knew I was interested in collecting these poems. My friends there kept telling
  me, “Look, what you’re doing is not inconsequential because at the very least, we’ll
  have a book that will preserve some of these poems and make them available.” It
  sounded a little grandiose and hyperbolic, but it’s not. It makes these twenty-five
  poems available. The fact is that English is an Indian language and indeed the global
  lingua franca by now. So any entry point into English is useful for local poets.</p>\n<p><b>Pandey:</b>
  Out of those one hundred and twenty drafts, how did you pick — and order — those
  that you felt most engaged with the contemporary situation?</p>\n<p><b>Kaul:</b>
  I was looking for poems that I thought were representative of what I believed to
  be certain emotions, states of feeling, forms, that are characteristic of the larger
  volume of poems. Yes, there are a great many <em>ghazals</em> here, but then there
  are <em>ghazals</em> that use the form of the <em>ghazal</em>, precisely the repetition
  that you are asking about, to emphasize the disorderly conditions that obtain in
  Kashmir. It’s a very odd phenomenon: you are using a very regular form, a form that
  is structured around repetitions, but the events you’re describing, the feelings
  you’re describing, are those of endless rupture, frustration, fear, anxiety, misery.
  To an extent, these are personal choices, so once I felt I had found a poem that
  worked with a conventional form, but did it interestingly, innovatively, those were
  the kinds of poems I chose.</p>\n<p>And then it came to deciding how to order the
  book. I went back and forth with the order for a long time… and it’s not as if I
  can offer you a precise template that governed my decisions, but there was a sense
  in which I wanted, in the beginning, to open with poems that spent time describing
  what Kashmir felt like to people on the way to its becoming alienating or disturbed.
  And then I wanted poems that were innovative in form, that aren’t necessarily <em>nazms</em>
  or <em>ghazals</em>. I’ll give you an instance of what I mean. A poem like Naji
  Munawar’s “Then and Today,” is staged as a little dialogue. We don’t know who these
  people are, but you can guess the situation. Slightly older people, a man and a
  woman, sitting inside their home, the light is off, there’s fear in the air. “Now
  what are you getting enraged about?” asks one of them (I imagine it is the man),
  and the question is the little turn in the poem. Or rather, the answer is the unexpected
  irony: “Alas then it used to be said the darkness might swallow — / and now the
  light truly comes to devour.” The context of this poem, and why it’s particularly
  evocative, is the so-called crack-downs that became a feature of Kashmiri villages
  and small town life. Everyone turns off the lights. The police and the military
  are outside. You’re really scared. Light, when you see it, is not something that
  brings hope; it brings the chances of unwarranted attention. So this was a poem
  I found really startling precisely because of its form.</p>\n<p><b>Pandey:</b> You
  could very clearly see that some poems followed a conventional form, and some didn’t;
  they were just written in a moment, in the way they were meant to be written.</p>\n<p><b>Kaul:</b>
  Exactly. Those poems are much more urgent in their sense of things. The last couple
  of poems will tell you what my own hopes are. Som Nath Bhat Veer’s poem, “A New
  Day will Dawn,” is a song of hope in the middle of this misery, as is Zahid Mukhtar’s
  poem, “Who will change our destiny?” These are not poets I know, but I made it my
  business, once I had chosen their poems, to try and find them. Kashmir is still
  a small enough world that if I made phone calls to my friends, they would make phone
  calls to their friends, and somebody or other would be in touch with these poets,
  and many of them were on email.</p>\n<p>When I wrote to Zahid Mukhtar and I sent
  him this translation, he wrote back very kindly. He said “You know, I’m very touched
  that you have chosen to do this,” because I am a Hindu, and he is not, and that
  is part of the unfortunate, polarizing of life in Kashmir. And he said, and this
  was his phrase that I mention in my book, “It must be that our common pain which
  I have attempted to describe in my mother tongue,” which I found a very hopeful
  sentiment. It’s an almost lost sentiment, but that’s the only sentiment that allows
  for hope. So that’s why I close the book with these two poems, both of which look
  forward.</p>\n<p><b>Pandey:</b> I’m assuming Som Nath Bhat was Hindu?</p>\n<p><b>Kaul:</b>
  He is Hindu, and Zahid Mukhtar is Muslim. Arjun Dev Majboor, whose poem is at the
  beginning of the book, is Hindu, and the next poet in the book is Muslim.</p>\n<p><b>Pandey:</b>
  You translate a line in Maqbool Sajid’s <em>ghazal</em> as, “Eyes upon eyes weep,
  now what is left,” and in a note below the poem you explain, “It could also be translated
  as ‘Word upon word weeps, now what is left.’” You made notes like this in a few
  other poems too, I think. I remember specifically the translation of <em>jigar</em>[3]:
  I thought about it long and hard, and I couldn’t think of a word for it in English.
  It’s not quite “heart.” How did you translate these lines that didn’t have an exact
  meaning in English, or that could be interpreted one of two ways?</p>\n<p><b>Kaul:</b>
  In the second edition, the version I’ve decided to use is, “Word upon word weeps
  here, now what is left.” Why? A literary friend pointed out that the duality of
  meaning might well be the result of poor copyediting of the original. Here is the
  problem: when Urdu is written in Nastaliq[4], vowel markers are often dropped. So
  you literally have to recognize the word to be able to tell what kind of vowel to
  use. Now, Kashmiri has a great many more vowel markers, but when the poetry is printed
  in these journals, very often the calligrapher or the typesetter doesn’t use these
  vowel markers. In the original that I saw of this poem, the phrase <em>ashar, ashar</em>
  could have been read as <em>akshar, akshar</em>. It’s a question of uncertain or
  missing vowel markers, so I maintained both meanings. But then in conversation after
  the book was published, my friend said, “Look, it’s unlikely to have been that,
  I bet it was a typo.” I was persuaded by her to drop the original translation I
  had used, and now in the new edition that note has disappeared.</p>\n<p><b>Pandey:</b>
  Is all of Kashmiri written in Nastaliq?</p>\n<p><b>Kaul:</b> Not quite, but increasingly
  so. This is part of what happens to language in a polarized situation. The original
  script of Kashmiri was a script called Sharda, which looks like Devnagari[5] but
  with additional consonants and vowel sounds. That script has disappeared. Sadly,
  what happened is that if you are a Muslim who writes in Kashmiri, you will prefer
  to write it in Nastaliq, plus Kashmiri vowel sounds with these new vowel markers.
  The state literary academy, the Sahitya Academy, is actually formulating ways in
  which this language can be orthographically more precise than it is when written
  in Nastaliq as Urdu is written. But a great many Hindus who write in Kashmiri choose
  to write it in Devanagri.</p>\n<p><b>Pandey:</b> So the language itself is becoming
  cut in half.</p>\n<p><b>Kaul:</b> The language itself is being represented in two
  different scripts. The future is likely to remain based in Nastaliq, because the
  largest numbers of users are those who write in Urdu, and know Nastaliq, and are
  likely to write Kashmiri in it. The language politics are interesting. Ever since
  this was a Dogra kingdom[6], that is, before independence and partition, the official
  language of the court was Urdu. Never Kashmiri. English was used, and Urdu was used:
  these were the languages of classical, literary, and philosophical education. Kashmiri
  was the people’s tongue; it was literally the vernacular.</p>\n<p><b>Pandey:</b>
  When you started, did you think you were going to preserve the very apparent musicality
  of the <em>ghazals</em> and <em>nazms</em>, or did you know it wouldn’t be possible?</p>\n<p><b>Kaul:</b>
  As I said, Kashmiri is very idiomatic. The hardest terms to translate from one language
  to another are idioms. There were times when I abandoned the effort. It would make
  no sense in English. It’s always a series of compromises. But when I read them in
  English, if I didn’t know the Kashmiri, I would sometimes think that there’s not
  a very particularly melodic progression in each of the lines. There are moments
  in the original with alliterative sounds and certain kinds of repetition, but it
  is just not possible to replicate all of them in English and retain meaning.</p>\n<p>Thus,
  and these are difficulties you discover, you always hope to find an idiom, a certain
  phrasing or a tone that will replicate the original. Then you recognize that is
  only aspiration, that it is not how it works in practice. Translation is as much
  compromise as anything else. The best I can claim for these translations is that
  [they] are compromises that [hopefully] work as poetry in English. I know some translators
  think of their writing as transcreation. They will take what they understand to
  be the sentiment, the approximate meaning, sometimes the arresting images of the
  original, and rewrite them into the new language, generating essentially a poem
  in response to that [original] poem, a poem that is much more overtly poetical in
  the new language. And that’s not what I was prepared to do. I wasn’t prepared to
  overwrite what I took to be some of the characteristic features of the original.
  And there the real challenge began, because you can’t overwrite, yet you can’t remain
  entirely faithful to the original.</p>\n<p><b>Pandey:</b> How did you get from your
  very literal, word-for-word first drafts to this finished product? That’s kind of
  a big step.</p>\n<p><b>Kaul:</b> Of course it is. But it isn’t a single step; it’s
  many steps. And many steps that you redo and go over and fix again. I wish I could
  say to you that here is a single principle I used, and this is what enabled me to
  keep redrafting. There was no single principle. You see something really arresting
  idiomatically and you think, “Okay, I’m going to find a way to replicate that idiom,”
  but what do you do with the rest of the line? You have to produce syntax that will
  allow it to make sense in English. You feel your way through this. And you recognize
  that you risk someone else [saying], “This particular image ought to have resulted
  in this kind of translation.”</p>\n<p>Once you recognize it in the original, trying
  to find a way of recreating it in the new language doesn’t always work, but it becomes
  one more thing you are alerted to. You have to find these little elements of the
  original and somehow find a way to bring as many of them over with you. That’s what
  compromise means. I think working compromises are precisely getting translation
  right.</p>\n<p><b>Pandey:</b> You talked about these poems engaging with contemporary
  circumstance, and of course what’s happening in Kashmir right now is very near to
  your heart. When you were compiling these essays and poems, did you mean them as
  political statement or did you mean them to just say, “This is what Kashmir is,”
  or something else entirely?</p>\n<p><b>Kaul:</b> You know, when you’ve been doing
  what I’ve been doing for as long as I have, you no longer believe that anything
  can stand on its own. My very choice of this project, my decision to take it from
  individual essays to these translations is political too… but part of the work of
  these translations is a sign of my own desperation. When you go there and you visit…
  my parents would be there, and my mother and my sister…  I would look around and
  say, “What I see here is not India, this is not democracy, this is not anything
  I love and value about India.” And then you think “Okay, so then what?”</p>\n<p>And
  the answer is that I’m not going to become a politician, or a political theorist,
  or an advisor to the governor, but I have certain skills that can, I hope, generate
  the picture of a world under siege, both in terms of its cultural productivity in
  these poems, but also in terms of my own understanding and my own commentary. To
  that extent, it is meant to be an intervention. If people read this, I hope the
  book will change their mind, so that the “Kashmir problem” doesn’t remain a binary
  between India and Pakistan, as if Kashmiris do not matter. It’s a very mottled,
  ugly history that has been put into place there. I think of myself as an Indian.
  I think of myself as a democrat. I think of myself as a Kashmiri. Those three terms
  right now are not in easy alignment. So that’s what this book is meant to be. It’s
  almost a cry, in its own minor key, that says, “Pay attention.”</p>\n<p><b>Pandey:</b>
  I also saw it as a small reconciliation of some of the differences, because you’ve
  published Hindus and Muslims side by side, because you chose to stick to Kashmiri,
  which is written in both Nastaliq and Devnagari. You know, Kashmiri is literally
  a bridge between those two communities, which is special and rare.</p>\n<p><b>Kaul:</b>
  That’s what I argue: that it’s in Kashmiri that you find commonality. In the language,
  the common pain, the common history, and I hope the common future. I wrote this
  book fully cognizant that I am a Hindu writing about what is commonly perceived
  to be a Muslim problem. But it’s not a Muslim problem alone. It’s a Kashmiri problem,
  and it’s a problem for Indians who are democrats. I’m hoping that if this book enacts
  the necessity of empathizing with those who have suffered, it will work as a model
  for those who live and work in Kashmir too. I hope that young Muslims will start
  thinking of the kinds of resources of culture and community that have been lost
  in the last so many years, as the bulk of Hindus have left. I hope Pandits (which
  is what Kashmiri Hindus are called) will work to extend their own feelings of loss
  and alienation into empathy for all that their Muslim neighbors have suffered. And,
  projects like this one and other parallel ones are an attempt to say there is a
  commonality of language, expression, feeling, belief, not religious belief in its
  particularity, but belief in something larger, that needs to be rebuilt.</p>\n\n<p>[1]
