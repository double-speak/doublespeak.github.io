poem: |-
  나 보기가 역겨워
  가실 때에는
  말없이 고이 보내드리오리다.

  영변에 약산
  진달래 꽃
  아름 따다 가실 길에 뿌리오리다.

  가시는 걸음걸음
  놓인 그 꽃을
  사뿐이 즈려 밟고 가시옵소서.

  나 보기가 역겨워
  가실 때에는
  죽어도 아니 눈물 흘리오리다.
transpoem: |-
  when you’re done with me
  when you leave me
  gently, I open the door

  a mountain in Yongbyeon
  armful of azaleas,
  I lay a flower-layered floor

  your footsteps fade
  tread lightly my love
  for the flowers, nothing more

  when you’re done with me
  when you leave me
  I’ll let go of before
note: "<p>Translating on one’s own is difficult enough, but translating as a diverse
  group of seven women is infinitely more difficult. The fact that two of us speak
  Korean was helpful, of course, but even those of us with no knowledge of the language
  felt strongly about each choice. There were often moments when those who spoke Korean
  felt that the others’ translations were not close enough to the original, and so
  it became a tug-of-war between staying true to the original and trying to convey
  the sense of resignation that we all were wrestling with. There were times when
  feelings won, such as the choice to translate with minimal punctuation or capitalization
  — though the original has periods that lend it a sense of finality, we all felt
  that this love story was unfinished, and so we chose to not use any punctuation
  aside from the occasional comma. Other times, we stayed true to the original. Our
  decision to rhyme the last line of every stanza came from the rhyming and melodic
  sounds in the Korean. Though this made our translation process more difficult, we
  were all very pleased with the results. Poetry is perhaps the most universal and
  yet the most intimate form of language. This paradox (or this serendipity) emerged
  at each step of our process.</p>"
abio: <p>Kim Sowol (<span lang="ko">김소월</span>) was a famous early modern poet from
  Northern Korea, when Korea was not yet divided. He is best known for his collection
  <em>The Azaleas</em>, which was published in 1925 when Kim was twenty-five years
  old. He was most adored for incorporating Korean folk rhythms into his poetry, as
  these rhythms touched the hearts of his audience. They also create an additional
  challenge for translators of his work. Despite his short-lived life, Kim Sowol is
  considered one of Korea’s most beloved twentieth-century poets.</p>
tbio: "<p><em>DoubleSpeak</em>’s editorial staff is a combination of eight strong
  women. We love translating and writing and eating pizza and fava beans and being
  with other strong women who translate and write and love. We come from College Station,
  Texas, Seoul, Korea, China, Canada, and California, from Seattle, India, and from
  Philadelphia. Between us, we speak Hindi, German, Korean, Chinese, French, Spanish,
  Hebrew, and many different versions of English.</p>"
