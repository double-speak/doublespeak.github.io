transtitle: A Tree in Blossom
author: Xi Murong
translator: Tina Zhu
poem: "如何让你遇见我 \n在我最美丽的时刻　为这 \n我已在佛前　求了五百年 \n求佛让我们结这一段尘缘 \n\n佛于是把我变成一棵树 \n长在你必经的路边
  \n阳光下慎重地开满花朵 \n朵朵都是我前世的企盼 \n\n当你走近　请你细听 \n那颤抖的叶是我等待的热情 \n而当你终于无视地走过 \n在你身后落了一地的
  \n朋友啊　那不是花瓣 \n是我凋零的心"
transpoem: |-
  how can I let you come across me
  in the moment I am most beautiful?        for this,
  I have stood before the Buddha      pleaded for five hundred years
  pleading for him to tie our earthly bonds together


  and so the Buddha turned me into a tree
  growing beside the path traced by your fate
  now I flower fully in the sunlight
  each blossom a longing from an old life

  when you come close        please, listen carefully
  that trembling of leaves is the passion I wait with
  and when at long last you pass by, unknowing
  what falls and covers the ground behind you


  oh, my friend        those are not petals
  they are my heart, withered away
note: "<p>In translating Xi Murong’s most famous poem, my aim was to maintain the
  naturalness of the diction in the original without diminishing its sense of spirituality
  and emotion. In addition to deciding not to capitalize lines or add in more punctuation,
  I also kept the occasional extra spaces in the original, which I felt created more
  natural pauses without disrupting the flow of the poem. I wanted to capture the
  quiet desperation beneath her religious language and gorgeous imagery without veering
  into melodrama. It was a difficult balancing act, especially in the final two lines,
  where the speaker exclaims (or maybe sighs?) directly to the addressee with such
  vulnerability.</p>"

  poet and painter who comes from inner Mongolia and has ties to Taiwan. She is most
  famous for her poetry collections <em>Seven-li Scent</em> and <em>Unregrettable
  Youth</em>. Her style is subtle yet uninhibited, profound yet unpretentious, and
  deeply moving. Her work is influenced by ancient Eastern philosophy, and it often
  contains religious undercurrents that evoke the impermanence of human existence.</p>
