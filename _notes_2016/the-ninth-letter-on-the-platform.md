transtitle: 'The Ninth Letter: On the Platform'
author: Nizar Qabbani
translator: Michael Karam
poem: |
  أعرفُ . .
  ونحنُ على رَصيفِ المَحَطَّة
  أنَّكِ تنتظرينَ رَجُلًا آخَرَ . .
  وأعرِفُ أنني لَم أكُنْ
  سِوى مِروَحَةٍ صِينِيَّةٍ خَفَّفَتْ عنكِ حَرارةَ الصَّيفْ
  ورَميْتِها بعدَ الصَّيف . .
  أعرِفُ أيضًا
  أنَّ رَسائِلَ الحُبّ التي كتبتُها لكِ
  لم تَكُن سِوى مَرايا رأيتِ فيها غُرُورَكِ . .
  وَمَعَ هذا.
  سَأحمِلُ حَقائِبَكِ . .
  وَحقائِبَ حَبيبِكِ . .
  لأنني أستَحي أن أصفَعَ امرأةًٌ
  تحمِلُ في حَقيبَةِ يدَيْها البَيْضاءْ
  أحلَى أيامِ حَياتي . .

  I know…
  as we stand here on the platform
  you’ve been waiting for someone else…
  And I know I was nothing
  but a cheap fan to ease summer’s heat
  till summer ended…
  I know too
  that in my love letters to you,
  you saw a mirror.
  Still.
  I’ll carry your luggage…
  And I’ll carry your lover’s luggage…
  for I’m too honorable to hurt a lover
  who holds, in the white bag
  swinging gently from her hands,
  the best days of my life…
note: "<p>I chose to translate a Qabbani poem because of how much his name and works
  remind me of my early schooling in Lebanon. While he is not as famous in America,
  I hope this is a step towards a growing fascinated audience. Even if you’ve never
  stood on a train platform, this image of fleeting love is a familiar one. There
  were some key decisions I had to make in this translation process. I wanted to remain
  true to the original’s punctuation and shape on the page even at the risk of its
  flow, in English. I did translate <em>Chinese fan</em> (from the literal Arabic)
  to <em>cheap fan</em>, because the former doesn’t enlist the same enthymematic suggestion
  for the English-language reader as it does for the reader of Arabic.</p>\n"
abio: <p>Nizar Qabbani (<span lang="ar">نزار توفيق قباني</span>, 1923–1998) is a timeless
  Arab poet known for his sensual and romantic verse. Beyond his two dozen volumes
  of poetry and contributions to the Lebanese newspaper <em>Al Hayat</em>, his poetry
  is often sung by Lebanese and Syrian vocalists who have popularized his work. Young
  and old people in Lebanon (where he lived for years) and in Syria (his home country)
  love these familiar tunes. Qabbani writes of romantic and political despair; his
  poetry advocates for Arab nationalism and social freedoms for women.</p>
tbio: "<p>Michael Karam is a senior in the College at the University of Pennsylvania
  studying economics and international relations with a math minor. He is passionate
  about languages and bringing communities together. Michael loved memorizing and
  reciting Qabbani’s poetry when he was in elementary school in Lebanon. Poetry by
  Qabbani is also a reminder that the people suffering from the war in Syria are humans
  who have the right to live and love too.</p>"
