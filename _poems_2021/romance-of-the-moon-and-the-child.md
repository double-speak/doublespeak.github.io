transtitle: Romance of the moon and the child
author: Federico García Lorca
translator: Darío Goldgel Carballo
poem: "La luna vino a la fragua  \ncon su polisón de nardos.  \nEl niño la mira, mira.
  \nEl niño la está mirando.  \n\nEn el aire conmovido  \nmueve la luna sus brazos
  \ \ny enseña, lúbrica y pura,  \nsus senos de duro estaño.  \n\nHuye luna, luna,
  luna.  \nSi vinieran los gitanos,  \nharían con tu corazón \ncollares y anillos
  blancos.\n   \nNiño, déjame que baile.  \nCuando vengan los gitanos, \nte encontrarán
  sobre el yunque  \ncon los ojillos cerrados.   \n\nHuye luna, luna, luna, \nque
  ya siento sus caballos. \nNiño, déjame, no pises  \nmi blancor almidonado.   \n\nEl
  jinete se acercaba  \ntocando el tambor del llano.  \nDentro de la fragua el niño,
  \ntiene los ojos cerrados.  \n\nPor el olivar venían, \nbronce y sueño, los gitanos.
  \nLas cabezas levantadas  \ny los ojos entornados.    \n\nCómo canta la zumaya,
  \n¡ay, cómo canta en el árbol! \nPor el cielo va la luna  \ncon un niño de la mano.
  \ \n\nDentro de la fragua lloran, \ndando gritos, los gitanos.\nEl aire la vela,
  vela.\nEl aire la está velando."
transpoem: "The moon has flown down to the forge, \na dress of blossoms, white, she
  wears,\nthe child at her, he stares, he looks, \nhe looks still, and still he stares.\n\nHer
  arms extend and slide and move, \narouse and stir the shaken air.\nLubricious, she
  is showing now,\nresolved and stout, her hard tin breasts.\n\nTake flight, oh moon,
  oh moon, oh moon!\nIf gypsies were to find you there\nthey would, no doubt, craft
  from your heart \nwhite rings and beads to fit their wares!\n\nBe quiet, child,
  and let me dance, \nas when the gypsies come upstairs \nthe anvil shall then be
  the bed\nwhere you will lie, eyes closed, and bare!\n\nTake flight, oh moon, oh
  moon, oh moon!\nI hear the rumble of their mares!\nAway, dim child! Look out, don’t
  step! \nMy starchy whiteness you may taint!\n\nThe rider strode, and swift he approached,
  \nthe drumbeat sowed across the plains.\nInside the forge, the anvil is\nbed for
  the child, eyes closed, and bare.\n\nAnd through the field of olive trees \nwithin
  a dream, bronze gypsies came.\nTheir heads well raised, they stand staunch, \ntheir
  eyes half-closed and unaware.\n\nOh, hear the way the nightjar sings! \nOh, hear
  its song, its grieved fanfare! \nUp in the sky, the moon ascends \nnext to a child,
  his hand with hers.\n\nInside the forge, the gypsies moan, \ntheir voices cast cries
  of despair.\nA vigil keeps, the air with gloom, \na gloomy vigil keeps the air.\n"
note: "<p>I read several English translations of this famous poem and always encountered
  the same problem: the words of the poet are treated as a sacred material, and the
  translator’s objective is to find the closest intelligible approximation. Yet here
  Lorca combines both literary exquisiteness with a sort of childish nonsense (as
  is the arbitrary repetition of some words), which conveys what I believe to be the
  poem’s universality. Moreover, the octosyllabic verse is the traditional form of
  the popular song in Spanish, and breaking it results in a text intended to be read
  and not to be listened to. Perhaps out of stubbornness, I decided to keep the octosyllable.
  However, as I felt this structure sounded too foreign in English, I rearranged it
  into iambic tetrameter. Now, those familiar with Spanish may know it is quite verbose
  as a language, so filling up some of those verses was a challenge. Sometimes I even
  had the opposite problem as seen in the example of the word <em>olivar</em> (“field
  of olive trees”). After accepting the limitations of the translation process, my
  solution was either to heretically add my own words or to mutilate the text, so
  I could preserve the musicality (<em>perdón, Federico</em>).</p>"

  <p>Federico García Lorca (1898–1936) is perhaps the most renowned Spanish poet and playwright of the twentieth century and one of the main figures of the avant-garde in Spain. This poem, from his 1928 book <em>Romancero Gitano</em> (lit. <em>Gypsy Songbook</em>), combines the influence of classical poets from sixteenth-century Spain with the surrealist movement of its epoch. It also references the popular song from the subaltern classes of southern Spain and features a strong influence from its Arabic roots. As such, many of his poems (this one included) have been adapted as flamenco songs during the years.</p>
  <p>A supporter of socialism, García Lorca was arrested and assassinated by fascists at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.</p>
tbio: "<p>Darío Goldgel Carballo is a PhD candidate in the romance languages department
  at the University of Pennsylvania, where he analyzes movies no one will watch and
  books no one will read in order to reflect on the social realities of Latin America.
  Darío really hates writing his own biography, as he feels it sounds like boasting,
  and will hope that <em>DoubleSpeak</em> is informal enough to forgive him. He has,
  indeed, done some stuff in his life, but nothing that can trick the readers into
  taking his translation more seriously.</p>"
