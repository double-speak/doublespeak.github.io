title: Forse la trasparenza
transtitle: Maybe it's clarity
author: Filippo Vignali
translator: Giulia Rupi; John Sherer
poem: "Forse la trasparenza o la capacità di rendere bella\r\nla luce che lo attraversa
  anche quando è scarsa.\r\nLa prima caratteristica\r\nche ti verrebbe in mente per
  definire il cristallo\r\nnon è la fragilità.\r\nE allora parliamo di coraggio, sensibilità,
  prudenza\r\nnell’offrirsi al mondo con pochi filtri\r\nsapendo che il torrente scava
  un greto\r\ne deposita i suoi detriti\r\nsolo quando passa lontano dalla terra degli
  indifferenti.\r\nL’innocenza può essere costruita\r\nlavorata come la purezza del
  cristallo\r\nnon dipende dall’essere troppo giovani\r\nper aver assaggiato abbastanza
  veleno."
transpoem: "Maybe it’s clarity, or the power to make the light\r\nshining through
  it beautiful, even when it’s scarce.\r\nThe first quality\r\nthat would come to
  mind when defining a crystal\r\nis not fragility.\r\nAnd so we speak of courage,
  sensitivity, prudence\r\nwhen giving in to the world with few filters,\r\nknowing
  that the creek digs its bed\r\nand leaves its debris\r\nonly when it flows far from
  the land of the indifferent.\r\nInnocence can be built,\r\npolished to a crystal’s
  purity;\r\nit can be young or old\r\nas long as enough venom has been tasted."
note: "<p>Filippo Vignali’s poems hark back to the <em>poetica del fanciullino</em>,
  the “poetics of the child,” as described by the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli. In
  this tradition, fragility, innocence, and vulnerability are the keys that open many
  doors, teaching us to be our truest selves and to feel unreservedly all things good
  and bad. These characteristics allow us to be more aware of the world around us,
  to open our eyes and see reality anew; we are called to use our intuition instead
  of our so-called mature, rational faculties.</p>\r\n<p>The poems in Vignali’s book
  <em>Le conseguenze dell’infanzia</em> (<em>Childhood Consequences</em>) engage with
  childhood experiences never for the sake of mere nostalgia, but in order to investigate
  the radical possibilities of innocence. In these poems, innocence is not a beginning
  state from which one emerges, but instead a quality that one achieves through trial
  and difficulty: “Innocence can be built, / polished to a crystal’s purity; it can
  be young or old / as long as enough venom has been tasted.” Youth is a source of
  wisdom, a wisdom rekindled in the thoughts of a retrospective adult. And that’s
  as it should be, for adults — too often inured to apathy — are the ones in need
  of such wisdom.</p>\r\n<p>In translating these poems, we chose clarity of voice
  over a stimulating reading experience. Vignali uses little punctuation — less confusing
  in Italian than in English; Italian grammar contains many structural cues that alert
  readers to which verbs and nouns go together, what adjectives are describing which
  nouns, and so on. These cues are less abundant in English, so translating the poems
  with a similar lack of punctuation risks puzzling the reader, and would offer only
  a superficially similar reading experience.</p>\r\n"
