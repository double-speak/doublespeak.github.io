transtitle: Maybe it's clarity
author: Filippo Vignali
translator: Giulia Rupi; John Sherer
poem: |-
  Forse la trasparenza o la capacità di rendere bella
  la luce che lo attraversa anche quando è scarsa.
  La prima caratteristica
  che ti verrebbe in mente per definire il cristallo
  non è la fragilità.
  E allora parliamo di coraggio, sensibilità, prudenza
  nell’offrirsi al mondo con pochi filtri
  sapendo che il torrente scava un greto
  e deposita i suoi detriti
  solo quando passa lontano dalla terra degli indifferenti.
  L’innocenza può essere costruita
  lavorata come la purezza del cristallo
  non dipende dall’essere troppo giovani
  per aver assaggiato abbastanza veleno.
transpoem: |-
  Maybe it’s clarity, or the power to make the light
  shining through it beautiful, even when it’s scarce.
  The first quality
  that would come to mind when defining a crystal
  is not fragility.
  And so we speak of courage, sensitivity, prudence
  when giving in to the world with few filters,
  knowing that the creek digs its bed
  and leaves its debris
  only when it flows far from the land of the indifferent.
  Innocence can be built,
  polished to a crystal’s purity;
  it can be young or old
  as long as enough venom has been tasted.
note: |
  <p>Filippo Vignali’s poems hark back to the <em>poetica del fanciullino</em>, the “poetics of the child,” as described by the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli. In this tradition, fragility, innocence, and vulnerability are the keys that open many doors, teaching us to be our truest selves and to feel unreservedly all things good and bad. These characteristics allow us to be more aware of the world around us, to open our eyes and see reality anew; we are called to use our intuition instead of our so-called mature, rational faculties.</p>
  <p>The poems in Vignali’s book <em>Le conseguenze dell’infanzia</em> (<em>Childhood Consequences</em>) engage with childhood experiences never for the sake of mere nostalgia, but in order to investigate the radical possibilities of innocence. In these poems, innocence is not a beginning state from which one emerges, but instead a quality that one achieves through trial and difficulty: “Innocence can be built, / polished to a crystal’s purity; it can be young or old / as long as enough venom has been tasted.” Youth is a source of wisdom, a wisdom rekindled in the thoughts of a retrospective adult. And that’s as it should be, for adults — too often inured to apathy — are the ones in need of such wisdom.</p>
  <p>In translating these poems, we chose clarity of voice over a stimulating reading experience. Vignali uses little punctuation — less confusing in Italian than in English; Italian grammar contains many structural cues that alert readers to which verbs and nouns go together, what adjectives are describing which nouns, and so on. These cues are less abundant in English, so translating the poems with a similar lack of punctuation risks puzzling the reader, and would offer only a superficially similar reading experience.</p>
