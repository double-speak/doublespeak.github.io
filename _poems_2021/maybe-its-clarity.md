poem: |
  Forse la trasparenza o la capacità di rendere bella
  la luce che lo attraversa anche quando è scarsa.
  La prima caratteristica
  che ti verrebbe in mente per definire il cristallo
  non è la fragilità.
  E allora parliamo di coraggio, sensibilità, prudenza
  nell’offrirsi al mondo con pochi filtri
  sapendo che il torrente scava un greto
  e deposita i suoi detriti
  solo quando passa lontano dalla terra degli indifferenti.
  L’innocenza può essere costruita
  lavorata come la purezza del cristallo
  non dipende dall’essere troppo giovani
  per aver assaggiato abbastanza veleno.

  Riusciamo a fare silenzio
  e a metterci in ascolto dei corpi?
  Ci parlano di simmetrie, incastri
  navi che ritrovano la costa
  mute corrispondenze
  respiri che si intrecciano
  rossore rappreso sul viso
  per il calore dato e ricevuto.
  La saggezza dei corpi è un mistero
  a cui dovremmo abbandonarci con fiducia
  per come ci puntella un abbraccio
  ci guarisce una carezza
  per come sposta le nostre maree
  la mezzaluna di un sorriso vero.

  Vedo mio padre piangere,
  sciogliersi sotto quella pioggia.
  Bastioni che cadono
  bombe che implodono
  nella mia stanza dei giochi.
  Lo vedo madido
  baluginante di una forza
  cresciuta dentro silenziosa
  in un’attesa guerresca.
  Lo vedo plastico
  monumento alla prudenza
  di non scomporre e rimangiare frasi
  per fare uscire qualcosa
  di più educato
  ma di meno vero.

  Maybe it’s clarity, or the power to make the light
  shining through it beautiful, even when it’s scarce.
  The first quality
  that would come to mind when defining a crystal
  is not fragility.
  And so we speak of courage, sensitivity, prudence
  when giving in to the world with few filters,
  knowing that the creek digs its bed
  and leaves its debris
  only when it flows far from the land of the indifferent.
  Innocence can be built,
  polished to a crystal’s purity;
  it can be young or old
  as long as enough venom has been tasted.

  Can we keep quiet
  and listen in to our bodies?
  They speak of symmetries, dovetails
  ships finding the coast again
  silent correspondences
  intertwining breaths
  redness clotted on the face
  for warmth given and received.
  The wisdom of bodies is a mystery
  we should give in to with confidence:
  how a hug props us up
  a caress heals us
  how our tides are moved
  by the half-moon of a true smile.

  I see my father crying,
  melting under that rain.
  Bastions falling
  bombs imploding
  in my playroom.
  I see him drenched
  gleaming with a force
  grown silent inside
  in a warlike wait.
  I see him as a plastic
  monument to the prudence
  of not splitting apart and taking back sentences
  so as to let out something
  more polite
  but less true.
note: |
  <p>Filippo Vignali’s poems hark back to the <em>poetica del fanciullino</em>, the “poetics of the child,” as described by the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli. In this tradition, fragility, innocence, and vulnerability are the keys that open many doors, teaching us to be our truest selves and to feel unreservedly all things good and bad. These characteristics allow us to be more aware of the world around us, to open our eyes and see reality anew; we are called to use our intuition instead of our so-called mature, rational faculties.</p>
  <p>The poems in Vignali’s book <em>Le conseguenze dell’infanzia</em> (<em>Childhood Consequences</em>) engage with childhood experiences never for the sake of mere nostalgia, but in order to investigate the radical possibilities of innocence. In these poems, innocence is not a beginning state from which one emerges, but instead a quality that one achieves through trial and difficulty: “Innocence can be built, / polished to a crystal’s purity; it can be young or old / as long as enough venom has been tasted.” Youth is a source of wisdom, a wisdom rekindled in the thoughts of a retrospective adult. And that’s as it should be, for adults — too often inured to apathy — are the ones in need of such wisdom.</p>
  <p>In translating these poems, we chose clarity of voice over a stimulating reading experience. Vignali uses little punctuation — less confusing in Italian than in English; Italian grammar contains many structural cues that alert readers to which verbs and nouns go together, what adjectives are describing which nouns, and so on. These cues are less abundant in English, so translating the poems with a similar lack of punctuation risks puzzling the reader, and would offer only a superficially similar reading experience.</p>
