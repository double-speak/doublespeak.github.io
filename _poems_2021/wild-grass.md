poem: "当我沉默着的时候，我觉得充实；我将开口，同时感到空虚 。 \n\r\n过去的生命已经死亡。我对于这死亡有大欢喜，因为我借此知道它曾经存活。死亡的生命已经朽腐。我对于这朽腐有大欢喜，因为我借此知道它还非空虚。
  \r\n生命的泥委弃在地面上，不生乔木，只生野草，这是我的罪过。 \n\r\n野草，根本不深，花叶不美，然而吸取露，吸取水，吸取陈死人的血和肉，各各夺取它的生存。当生存时，还是将遭践踏，将遭删刈，直至于死亡而朽腐。
  \r\n但我坦然，欣然。我将大笑，我将歌唱。 \n\r\n我自爱我的野草，但我憎恶这以野草作装饰的地面。 \n\r\n地火在地下运行，奔突；熔岩一旦喷出，将烧尽一切野草，以及乔木，于是并且无可朽腐。但我坦然，欣然。我将大笑，我将歌唱。
  \n\r\n天地有如此静穆，我不能大笑而且歌唱。天地即不如此静穆，我或者也将不能。我以这一丛野草，在明与暗，生与死，过去与未来之际，献于友与仇，人与兽，爱者与不爱者之前作证。
  \n\r\n为我自己，为友与仇，人与兽，爱者与不爱者，我希望这野草的死亡与朽腐，火速到来。要 不然，我先就未曾生存，这实在比死亡与朽腐更其不幸。 \r\n去罢，野草，连着我的题辞！"
transpoem: "When I’m quiet, I feel complete; I then open my mouth, simultaneously
  feeling empty. \n\nThe past life has already died. With respect to its death, I
  am overjoyed, for from its death I know that it once was alive. \n\nThis dead life
  has already rotted. With respect to its decomposition, I am overjoyed, as from its
  rotting I know that it has not been empty. \nThe sludge of life drips on the earth,
  but it doesn’t nourish forests, only bears wild grass, this is my fault. \n\nWild
  grass — doesn’t run deep, doesn’t have pretty flowers or leaves, but rather sucks
  up dew, sucks up water, sucks up old remains of the blood and flesh of the dead,
  each form trying to take life from it. \n\nWhen it was living, it’d be tread upon
  and cut down until it’d die and rot. \n\nBut I’m at ease, happy. I’ll laugh, I’ll
  sing. \n\nI love my wild grass, but I scorn this ground that’s adorned in wild grass.\n
  \nThe fires under the earth are moving, running wild; once the fire erupts, it will
  consume all the wild grass and the tall trees, such that nothing will be left to
  rot. \n\nBut I’m at ease, happy. I’ll laugh, I’ll sing.\n \nHeaven and earth are
  so silent, and so I can’t laugh or sing. \n\nIf heaven and earth weren’t so silent,
  I probably still couldn’t do these things. \n\nI — caught between light and darkness,
  life and death, past and present — dedicate as a testimony this bunch of wild grass
  to friends and enemies, man and beast, those I love and those I don’t love. \n\nFor
  myself, for friends and enemies, man and beast, those I love and those I do not:
  I hope this wild grass’ destruction and decay come quickly. If not, I will not have
  lived at all; this, in actuality, is even more pitiful than dying and decaying.
  \n\nGo now, wild grass, along with my epigraph!"
note: |-
  <p>I debated a lot about whether or not to change the punctuation to something more widely accepted (no run ons, fragments, etc.), but to honor Lu Xun and his legacy of spearheading the vernacular movement in the early twentieth century, I figured I should make it as conversational as possible. This meant preserving — for the most part — fragments and unorthodox comma rules, as well as keeping vocabulary and sentence structures at a very colloquial level. His poem is very conversational, and thus I opted for the use of contractions, such as “I’ll” instead of “I shall” or even “I will” for <span lang= "zh">我将</span>, among others.</p>
  <p>Secondly, a note on why I veered away from a literal word choice: <span lang= "zh">吸取</span> literally translates to “absorb,” but I wanted to make the verb more active to personify the grass. Also, I felt that “absorb” wasn’t active enough to be used thrice in a row with the same biting tone the poem had — it dulled the energy. “Sucking” seemed good because the character <span lang= "zh">吸</span> is also used in the word for “straw,” <span lang= "zh">吸管</span>, and the image Lu presents in his poem is incredibly visceral while simultaneously whimsical. “Consume” felt too formal given Lu’s insistence on vernacular writing throughout his career.</p>
  <p>As for the title of the poem, it is typically translated as “The Foreword,” for it is both a poem as well as the foreword of Lu’s eponymous poetry book, <em>Wild Grass</em>. Since this is a standalone piece, I figured I should give it a standalone name. As for the tone, I tried to keep it ambivalent, as Lu Xun premises his book with this very morbid yet also playful introduction.</p>
abio: |-
  <p>Lu Xun (<span lang= "zh">鲁迅</span>) (1881–1936, birth name: Zhou Shuren <span lang= "zh">周树人</span>) is one of the most important — if not the most influential — early twentieth-century Chinese literati figures and essayists. Originally on a pre-med track, the Shaoxing, Zhejiang, native dropped out of Japanese medical school to pursue literature and heal his country with culture. One of the founding names of the modern Chinese vernacular movement, Lu sought to popularize poetry and novels that were written in the language the people spoke (<em>baihua wen</em>), instead of the antiquated Classical Chinese that employed gatekeeping grammatical structures and vocabulary. This made him one of the most popular of the twentieth century.</p>
  <p>He is adored by revolutionaries of all factions and flavors — from Chairman Mao to dissidents — and was politically ambiguous even though he was a definite Leftist. To illustrate this, he was the head of Shanghai’s League of Left-Wing Writers, but when the Chinese Communist Party asked him to write a novel of the communist revolution in rural China, he declined. He, along with other early twentieth-century Chinese writers, popularized writing about problems that plagued the common man, akin to the Realist movement of Gustave Flaubert and Émile Zola.</p>
  <p>Some of his other famous and amazing Chinese vernacular pieces are the short stories <span lang= "zh">《狂人日记》</span> (“A Madman’s Diary”) and <span lang= "zh">《阿Q正传》</span> (“A True Story of Ah Q”).</p>
tbio: "<p>Chardonnay Needler is just a scatterbrained person who likes languages.
  A sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania, she’s studying international relations
  and either Chinese or linguistics. She speaks and reads English, French, and Mandarin,
  and can barely get by in Japanese, Spanish, and Zulu. She loves examining the sociopolitical
  aspects of words and why they are chosen, which she was able to do in greater detail
  this past summer on a PURM project analyzing South African musicians’ and activists’
  use of translanguaging in song. The next language on her list is German, to get
  back in touch with her German-Jewish roots and read Hannah Arendt’s pieces in their
  original language.</p>"
