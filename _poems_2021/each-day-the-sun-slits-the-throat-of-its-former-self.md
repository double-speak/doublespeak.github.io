transtitle: each day the sun slits the throat of its former self
author: Amina Saïd
translator: Ashley Sniffen
poem: "chaque jour le soleil \r\négorge son spectre\r\net se lève dans son sang\r\n\r\ntout
  commencement \r\ndessine un cercle\r\nla mémoire mène \r\nà la mer des commencements\r\nla
  jetée est de pierre l’arbre d’exil\r\nj’aspire à l’horizon\r\n\r\nsur un fil de
  lumière\r\nje vais vers ce lieu qui est toi\r\net ce qui fut advient\r\n\r\nune
  étoile danse sur \r\nle ciel de mon front\r\nl’oiseau en nous renaît \r\nde la rive
  de l’âme\r\nta parole est tienne \r\nmienne est ma parole\r\n\r\ntu rejoins le lieu
  que je suis\r\net le poème continue de s’écrire\r\n\r\nje vois ton visage et \r\nl’ombre
  sur ton visage\r\ncomme le poème \r\nla souffrance se partage\r\nnous compatissons
  \r\nà l’arbre aux saisons\r\ntrop brèves et \r\nà l’exil des saisons\r\naux sourires
  et aux \r\ndéchirements de la terre\r\naux malheurs des hommes \r\naux prières des
  femmes\r\n\r\nà nos voeux l’instant prend \r\nsa forme éblouie\r\nle temps s’efface
  \r\ntel un paysage\r\nnous vivons les \r\ndeux moitiés de nos vies\r\ncomme un voyage
  qui \r\nse souviendrait peut-être\r\ndu nom des îles \r\ndes oiseaux des ports\r\ndu
  sillage blanc \r\ndes navires des villes des êtres\r\ndu cycle des arrivées et des
  départs\r\n\r\net nous tombons \r\namoureux de la nuit\r\nparce que chaque nuit
  \r\ncélèbre les noces du rêve\r\net nous tombons \r\namoureux du jour\r\nparce que
  la vie \r\ncommence avec chaque jour\r\n"
transpoem: "each day the sun slits \r\nthe throat of its former self\r\nand rises
  in its blood\r\n\r\neach beginning \r\nrepresents a circle\r\na memory leads \r\nto
  a sea of possibilities\r\na pier is made of rock \r\na tree of exile\r\ni yearn
  for the horizon\r\n\r\non a thread of light\r\ni proceed towards \r\nthis place
  that is you\r\nand what was begins again\r\n\r\na star dances on the sky \r\nthat
  is my forehead\r\nthe bird within us is reborn \r\nfrom the nest of our soul\r\nyour
  word is yours mine is my own\r\n\r\nyou return to the place that I am\r\nand the
  poem begins to write itself\r\n\r\ni see your face and \r\nthe shadow on your face\r\nlike
  a poem your suffering is shared\r\nwe share the grief of a withering tree\r\ntoo
  brief and at the mercy of the seasons\r\nof the smiles and of the rifts of the earth\r\nof
  men’s misfortunes of women’s prayers\r\n\r\nwith our wishes a moment takes \r\nits
  dazzled form\r\ntime fades like a landscape\r\nwe live the two halves of our lives\r\nas
  if on a journey we perhaps remember\r\nthe name of islands of birds of ports\r\nof
  the white wake of boats of cities of beings\r\nof the cycle of arrivals and of departures\r\n\r\nand
  we fall in love with the night\r\nbecause each night celebrates \r\na dream’s wedding\r\nand
  we fall in love with the day\r\nbecause life begins with each day\r\n"
note: "<p>I have loved the poems of Amina Saïd since I discovered her during my first
  year of college three years ago. Her rawness and directness comfort me; she employs
  common language and a lack of punctuation, which enable the reader to grapple directly
  with each word on the page. This poem is one of my absolute favorites, for it is
  easy to fall in love with the first line; the evocative imagery jumps out at the
  reader, forcing her to come to terms with a violent, self-destructive sun and its
  rebirth after tragedy each day. This concept forces us to consider the essence of
  life, of our own regeneration with the coming and going of each day. I chose to
  translate <i>égorge son spectre</i> as “slits the throat of its former self” instead
  of “slits the throat of its ghost” in order to convey a sense of rebirth and  regeneration
  of the sun as its own entity or “former self.” I wanted to delineate the poem’s
  first line, which also serves as its title, as evocative of the essence of a phoenix
  being reborn from ashes, and therefore believe the indication of “former self” is
  necessary in order to distinguish between a sense of the past and of the present.</p>\r\n<p>
  With the line “each beginning represents a circle,” I chose to translate the French
  <em>dessine</em> (“to draw”) in a more symbolic manner in order to underscore the
  symbolism of a circle as representative of a beginning or of this feeling of rebirth
  that the first line of the poem conveys. In this manner, I chose the word “possibilities”
  in lieu of “beginnings” for the French <em>commencements</em> in the following line
  to emphasize the sense of possibility that is enabled through rebirth, which inherently
  constitutes a new beginning.</p>\r\n<p> Saïd shirks off any usage of punctuation
  or capitalization; it seems that in some portions of the poem, particularly “and
  what was begins again,” might be better clarified by punctuation. However, I find
  the beauty in Saïd’s poetry to underscore an ephemerality rooted within words and
  a constancy lodged within uncertainty. Saïd seems to be telling us that poetry and
  therefore life cannot be fully understood through generic formulas of punctuation,
  but rather through endeavoring to unravel the deeper meaning within a collection
  of words themselves.</p>\r\n<p>I felt calm when reading the second to last stanza,
  for I find solace in the repetition of the French word <em>de</em> (“of”) for this
  repetition suggests the struggle of remembrance, of attempting to uncover past memories
  which are so inextricably tied to the present and the future that the lines of distinction
  are blurred. This repetition also mimics Saïd’s signature rambling style, forcing
  the reader to consider the poem as a stream of consciousness that can apply to any
  person’s experience of life and of the trials and tribulations involved with love,
  darkness, and light.</p>\r\n<p>Saïd juxtaposes notions of “you” with “me” in order
  to more fully arrive at the idea of an intertwining of souls, yet I believe that
  the beauty of this poem is more so discovered by ascertaining the connection of
  the individual self (or selves) with nature. By noting that “we fall in love with
  the night” and “we fall in love with the day,” she avails us to the beauty of life
  and the evocations of lightness and darkness imbued within it.</p>"
abio: "<p>Born in Tunis in 1953, Amina Saïd was raised bilingual, learning both Arabic
  and French in school and speaking Arabic, the language of her parents, at home.
  After being encouraged by her teacher, she began to write poetry in middle school
  and soon became enamored with the power of the written word to relate essential
  truths of being. She studied English in college and started to publish poetry soon
  after graduation. Saïd made a living as a journalist in France but continued to
  write throughout her life, ultimately publishing her work in numerous poetry collections
  and being considered as a unique voice based on her Tunisian heritage and experimentation
  with form.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Ashley Sniffen is a junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying art
  history and French and Francophone studies. Passionate about art, language, and
  education, she enjoys staring at the paintings hanging on white walls of museums
  and creating events that support artists and cultural institutions. In her spare
  time, she enjoys reading, basking in nature, and watching college basketball games.</p>"
