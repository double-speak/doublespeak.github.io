poem: "Послушайте!\r\nВедь, если звезды зажигают —\r\nзначит — это кому-нибудь нужно?\r\nЗначит
  — кто-то хочет, чтобы они были?\r\nЗначит — кто-то называет эти плевочки\r\nжемчужиной?\r\nИ,
  надрываясь\r\nв метелях полуденной пыли,\r\nврывается к богу,\r\nбоится, что опоздал,\r\nплачет,\r\nцелует
  ему жилистую руку,\r\nпросит —\r\nчтоб обязательно была звезда! —\r\nклянется —\r\nне
  перенесет эту беззвездную муку!\r\nА после\r\nходит тревожный,\r\nно спокойный наружно.\r\nГоворит
  кому-то:\r\n“Ведь теперь тебе ничего?\r\nНе страшно?\r\nДа?!”\r\nПослушайте!\r\nВедь,
  если звезды\r\nзажигают —\r\nзначит — это кому-нибудь нужно?\r\nЗначит — это необходимо,\r\nчтобы
  каждый вечер\r\nнад крышами\r\nзагоралась хоть одна звезда?!\r\n(1914)\r\n"
transpoem: "Listen!\r\nAfter all, if the stars are set alight,\r\ndoes it mean anyone
  needs it?\r\nDoes it mean someone wants them to be?\r\nDoes it mean someone is calling
  these spitlets pearls?\r\nAnd, toiling away\r\nin the torrents of midday dust,\r\nhe
  bursts in on God,\r\nfears that he was late,\r\ncries,\r\nkisses his veiny hand,\r\nasks
  \r\nthat there must be stars! -\r\nswears \r\nhe will not bear this starless torment!\r\nAnd
  after,\r\nhe walks about, restless,\r\nbut outwardly calm.\r\nSaying to someone:\r\n‘You
  don’t have anything now, do you?\r\nYou aren’t scared?\r\nRight?!’\r\nListen!\r\nAfter
  all, if the stars\r\nare set alight,\r\ndoes it mean anyone needs it?\r\nDoes it
  mean it’s necessary\r\nthat every night,\r\nabove the roofs,\r\nat least one star
  is set ablaze?!\r\n(1914)\r\n"
note: "<p>I began with a literal translation of the poem, ignoring word order and
  providing several translations of the same words to choose from later. Next, I formatted
  lines to match the original poem. Before moving onto polishing, I also identified
  turns of phrase that would need more time and thought to accurately incorporate
  into a final product. In polishing my rough translation of Mogutin’s poem, I began
  by adjusting word order to best match the point of syllabic emphasis in each clause,
  while with Mayakovsky’s I focused more on the emotions behind the poem. I then moved
  to honing in on word choices, leaving notes that indicated desired sentiment where
  I was still unsure of what I wanted to highlight. Next, I read through, thoughtfully
  evaluating and altering verb choices based on verbal aspect and active-passive voice
  within the clause. Lastly, I reviewed capitalization, punctuation, and line breaks
  to best match the original. A series of more detailed notes regarding stylistic
  choices in my translation are listed below:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"note\"><strong>“Conversation
  of a drunk poetess and her new lover”:</strong></ul>\r\n<li class=\"note\"><span
  lang= \"ru\"><em>захожу в дома</em></span> — To maintain the poetess’ conversational
  tone, I translated the prefix <span lang= \"ru\"><em>за-</em></span> as indicative
  of fleeting entrances, in which “I swing by” felt more appropriate.</li>\r\n<li
  class=\"note\"><span lang= \"ru\"><em>благодать такая</em></span> —  <span lang=
  \"ru\"><em>Такая</em></span> indicates a conversational ellipsis and buffer around
  the verb. I added “sort of” to add a brief pause to the line and slightly dampen
  the verb’s delivery.</li>\r\n<li class=\"note\"><span lang= \"ru\"><em>от меня лучи
  во все стороны</em></span> — “Beams” highlighted the emanating light of a saintly
  glow. I added “of light” to ensure readers wouldn’t picture large beams of wood
  protruding from the poetess. I inserted “going” into my translation of <span lang=
  \"ru\"><em>во все стороны</em></span> to highlight the outward movement indicated
  by the accusative case while maintaining a similar meter.</li>\r\n<li class=\"note\"><span
  lang= \"ru\"><em>между прочим, тебе телефон из-за меня отключили</em></span> — I
  originally translated this section as “it was cause of me that your phone line /
  was cut off.” I moved “cause of me” to the second line to improve the flow of the
  first. I also shortened “because\" to “cause,” to soften the point of emphasis on
  “me” in the sentence.</li>\r\n<li class=\"note\"><span lang= \"ru\"><em>телефон
  твой пиздец совсем, е.т.м.!</em></span> — I was struck by the sudden heatedness
  of this line and hoped to highlight it. I considered “your phone is totally fucked
  up,” but didn’t want the line sounding redundant when paired with the <span lang=
  \"ru\"><em>е.т.м.!</em></span> (“fuck your mother”). Given the wide range of meanings
  for <span lang= \"ru\"><em>пиздец</em></span>, “your phone is a total piece of shit,
  you motherfucker” fit the build and tone of the line best.</li>\r\n<ul class=\"note\"><strong>Listen!:</strong></ul>\r\n<li
  class=\"note\"><span lang= \"ru\"><em>плевочки</em></span> — A plural, diminutive
  form of <span lang= \"ru\"><em>плевок</em></span>, meaning “spit.” Originally, I
  translated the word as “spittles,” but felt that it was out of place. While somewhat
  contrived, “spitlets” offered a more robust alternative that could more easily be
  imagined in individual units.</li>\r\n<li class=\"note\"><span lang= \"ru\"><em>жемчужиной</em></span>
  — In my rough translation, I translated this word as “pearl-like,” but found that
  it slowed the meter’s momentum. The shift to “pearls” as a subject complement to
  the direct object, improved fluidity while adding a luster to the otherwise gross
  imagery of bits of spit. I felt that this was closer to Mayakovsky’s poetic intentions
  for the phrase.</li>"
abio: "<p>Vladimir Mayakovsky — poet, playwright, satirist, revolutionary, and futurist—was
  born in present-day Georgia to a Cossack father of noble descent and a Ukrainian
  mother. Moving to Moscow as a teenager, Mayakovsky was radicalized and joined local
  socialist groups. Following a brief prison sentence, Vladimir distanced himself
  from the Party, focusing instead on his independent socialist education. Mayakovsky
  discovered his literary voice as he became more involved in the Moscow artists’
  circles of the 1910s. He made his name in Futurist literary magazines with early
  poems like “Night” and “Take That!” Mayakovsky played a key role in early Bolshevik
  literature following the October Revolution, supporting socialist ideology not only
  in his writing but also through plays, film, and agitational propaganda. Mayakovsky’s
  <em>Vladimir Ilyich Lenin</em>, a poetic epic in tribute to the vanguard of the
  revolution, was applauded by both the Party and Soviet citizens. After the release
  of two satire pieces in the late 1920s, Vladimir’s relationship with the Party began
  to deteriorate and Soviet media targeted him in media campaigns. Following an argument
  with a romantic partner in 1930, Mayakovsky died of suicide. Mayakovsky’s pioneered
  Futurist and Socialist Realist genres, gaining revered status in the Soviet canon.</p>\r\n"
