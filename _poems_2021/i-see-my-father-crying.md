author: Filippo Vignali
translator: Giulia Rupi; John Sherer
poem: "Vedo mio padre piangere,\r\nsciogliersi sotto quella pioggia.\r\nBastioni che
  cadono\r\nbombe che implodono\r\nnella mia stanza dei giochi.\r\nLo vedo madido\r\nbaluginante
  di una forza\r\ncresciuta dentro silenziosa\r\nin un’attesa guerresca.\r\nLo vedo
  plastico\r\nmonumento alla prudenza\r\ndi non scomporre e rimangiare frasi\r\nper
  fare uscire qualcosa\r\ndi più educato\r\nma di meno vero."
transpoem: "I see my father crying,\r\nmelting under that rain.\r\nBastions falling\r\nbombs
  imploding\r\nin my playroom.\r\nI see him drenched\r\ngleaming with a force\r\ngrown
  silent inside\r\nin a warlike wait.\r\nI see him as a plastic\r\nmonument to the
  prudence\r\nof not splitting apart and taking back sentences\r\nso as to let out
  something\r\nmore polite\r\nbut less true."
note: "<p>Filippo Vignali’s poems hark back to the <em>poetica del fanciullino</em>,
  the “poetics of the child,” as described by the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli. In
  this tradition, fragility, innocence, and vulnerability are the keys that open many
  doors, teaching us to be our truest selves and to feel unreservedly all things good
  and bad. These characteristics allow us to be more aware of the world around us,
  to open our eyes and see reality anew; we are called to use our intuition instead
  of our so-called mature, rational faculties.</p>\r\n<p>The poems in Vignali’s book
  <em>Le conseguenze dell’infanzia</em> (<em>Childhood Consequences</em>) engage with
  childhood experiences never for the sake of mere nostalgia, but in order to investigate
  the radical possibilities of innocence. In these poems, innocence is not a beginning
  state from which one emerges, but instead a quality that one achieves through trial
  and difficulty: “Innocence can be built, / polished to a crystal’s purity; it can
  be young or old / as long as enough venom has been tasted.” Youth is a source of
  wisdom, a wisdom rekindled in the thoughts of a retrospective adult. And that’s
  as it should be, for adults — too often inured to apathy — are the ones in need
  of such wisdom.</p>\r\n<p>In translating these poems, we chose clarity of voice
  over a stimulating reading experience. Vignali uses little punctuation — less confusing
  in Italian than in English; Italian grammar contains many structural cues that alert
  readers to which verbs and nouns go together, what adjectives are describing which
  nouns, and so on. These cues are less abundant in English, so translating the poems
  with a similar lack of punctuation risks puzzling the reader, and would offer only
  a superficially similar reading experience.</p>\r\n"
