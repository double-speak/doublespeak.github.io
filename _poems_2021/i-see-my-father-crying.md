poem: |
  Vedo mio padre piangere,
  sciogliersi sotto quella pioggia.
  Bastioni che cadono
  bombe che implodono
  nella mia stanza dei giochi.
  Lo vedo madido
  baluginante di una forza
  cresciuta dentro silenziosa
  in un’attesa guerresca.
  Lo vedo plastico
  monumento alla prudenza
  di non scomporre e rimangiare frasi
  per fare uscire qualcosa
  di più educato
  ma di meno vero.
transpoem: |-
  I see my father crying,
  melting under that rain.
  Bastions falling
  bombs imploding
  in my playroom.
  I see him drenched
  gleaming with a force
  grown silent inside
  in a warlike wait.
  I see him as a plastic
  monument to the prudence
  of not splitting apart and taking back sentences
  so as to let out something
  more polite
  but less true.

  Filippo Vignali’s poems hark back to the <em>poetica del fanciullino</em>, the “poetics of the child,” as described by the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli. In this tradition, fragility, innocence, and vulnerability are the keys that open many doors, teaching us to be our truest selves and to feel unreservedly all things good and bad. These characteristics allow us to be more aware of the world around us, to open our eyes and see reality anew; we are called to use our intuition instead of our so-called mature, rational faculties.</p>
  <p>
  The poems in Vignali’s book <em>Le conseguenze dell’infanzia</em> (<em>Childhood Consequences</em>) engage with childhood experiences never for the sake of mere nostalgia, but in order to investigate the radical possibilities of innocence. In these poems, innocence is not a beginning state from which one emerges, but instead a quality that one achieves through trial and difficulty: “Innocence can be built, / polished to a crystal’s purity; it can be young or old / as long as enough venom has been tasted.” Youth is a source of wisdom, a wisdom rekindled in the thoughts of a retrospective adult. And that’s as it should be, for adults — too often inured to apathy — are the ones in need of such wisdom.</p>

  In translating these poems, we chose clarity of voice over a stimulating reading experience. Vignali uses little punctuation — less confusing in Italian than in English; Italian grammar contains many structural cues that alert readers to which verbs and nouns go together, what adjectives are describing which nouns, and so on. These cues are less abundant in English, so translating the poems with a similar lack of punctuation risks puzzling the reader, and would offer only a superficially similar reading experience.</p>
