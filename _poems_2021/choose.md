author: Nizar Qabbani
translator: Leah Baxter
poem: "إني خيرتك فاختاري\r\nما بين الموت على صدري.. \r\nأو فوق دفاتر أشعاري..\r\nإختاري
  الحب.. أو اللاحب\r\nفجبنٌ ألا تختاري..\r\nلا توجد منطقةٌ وسطى\r\nما بين الجنة والنار..\r\nإرمي
  أوراقك كاملةً..\r\nوسأرضى عن أي قرار..\r\nقولي. إنفعلي. إنفجري\r\nلا تقفي مثل المسمار..\r\nلا
  يمكن أن أبقى أبداً\r\nكالقشة تحت الأمطار\r\nإختاري قدراً بين اثنين\r\nوما أعنفها
  أقداري..\r\nمرهقةٌ أنت.. وخائفةٌ\r\nوطويلٌ جداً.. مشواري\r\nغوصي في البحر.. أو ابتعدي\r\nلا
  بحرٌ من غير دوار..\r\nالحب مواجهةٌ كبرى\r\nإبحارٌ ضد التيار\r\nصلبٌ.. وعذابٌ.. ودموعٌ\r\nورحيلٌ
  بين الأقمار..\r\nيقتلني جبنك يا امرأةً\r\nتتسلى من خلف ستار..\r\nإني لا أؤمن في
  حبٍ..\r\nلا يحمل نزق الثوار..\r\nلا يكسر كل الأسوار\r\nلا يضرب مثل الإعصار..\r\nآهٍ..
  لو حبك يبلعني\r\nيقلعني.. مثل الإعصار..\r\nإني خيرتك.. فاختاري\r\nما بين الموت على
  صدري\r\nأو فوق دفاتر أشعاري\r\nلا توجد منطقةٌ وسطى\r\nما بين الجنة والنار.."
transpoem: "I’ve asked that you choose\r\nbetween dying on my chest\r\nor atop a notebook
  of my poetry.\r\nChoose love, or no love.\r\nNot choosing is cowardice.\r\nThere
  can be no compromise\r\nbetween Paradise and Hellfire.\r\n\r\nThrow in all your
  cards,\r\nAnd I’ll be content with any decision.\r\nTalk to me. Become inflamed
  — Explode!\r\nJust don’t stand unwavering like a nail.\r\nIt’s impossible for me
  to wait here forever\r\nlike hay under the rain.\r\nChoose one destiny between the
  two —\r\nand oh, how extreme my options are.\r\n\r\nYou’re exhausted, and scared,\r\nand
  my journey is very long.\r\nPlunge into the sea with me, or leave.\r\nThere’s no
  sea without a little seasickness.\r\nLove is a major confrontation\r\nLike navigating
  against the current;\r\nTrial, torment, and tears\r\nLike‬ traveling between moons.‬\r\n\r\nYour
  cowardice is killing me, woman.\r\nYou’re sneaking around behind a curtain.\r\nI
  don’t trust a love\r\nthat isn’t as reckless as a revolutionary,\r\nthat won’t tear
  down every wall,\r\nthat doesn’t surge like a cyclone —\r\nYes, if only your love
  were to swallow me,\r\nto tear me out by the roots, like a tornado.\r\n\r\nI’ve
  asked that you choose\r\nbetween dying on my chest\r\nOr atop a notebook of my poetry.\r\nThere
  can be no compromise\r\nbetween Paradise and Hellfire.\r\n"
note: "<p>This poem was recommended to me by an Arabic-speaking friend (who also proofread
  my translation, bless her). I loved the beautiful and — is it silly to say? — poetic
  metaphors that Qabbani employs throughout the poem. These images translated very
  well into English. Descriptions such as “like hay under the rain” need no explanation
  or elaboration to connote the sense of slowly soaking into uselessness and rotting
  away; the metaphor itself does all of that already. Though no contextualization
  was needed, the tricky part was simply choosing the right words to illustrate those
  metaphors and to maintain the same implications.</p>\r\n<p>I found myself struggling
  with the tone of the speaker. Because the poem is mostly in the imperative, he comes
  across as a bit harsh and exasperated with his beloved and her waffling. However,
  he at times also softens his words, as in the end of the second verse and beginning
  of the third, in which he recognizes how difficult his request is for her and how
  much he is asking of her. Striking a balance between his exasperation and his understanding
  of her was difficult.</p>\r\n<p>I did take a bit of license with the specific grammatical
  structures of a few lines for clarity, as well as with alliteration, which was not
  quite as present in the original text but was in keeping with its original lyrical
  fluidity. Lines like “trial, torment, and tears” could have perhaps been more directly
  translated as “harshness, torment, and tears,” but I found “trial” to suit the sense
  of the line, as well as its sound, better. The original text I used also did not
  have stanza breaks. I inserted these based on common divisions I found in other
  versions and translations of the poem, as well as on where they seemed most fitting
  content-wise.</p>"
abio: "<p>Nizar Qabbani was a Syrian poet, writer, diplomat, and intellectual, though
  he is most widely known for his poetry. Qabbani was born in Damascus in 1923. He
  is considered one of the most prominent Arab poets, and often wrote on social and
  political themes, such as feminism and Arab nationalism; he also wrote many erotic
  and love poems, such as this one. Qabbani’s work was often controversial both for
  its social and sexual progressivism, but he remained a beloved public figure internationally.
  He also worked in the Syrian diplomatic service for many years, writing all the
  while. Qabbani married twice, first to Zahra Aqbiq and later to Balqis al-Rawi,
  an Iraqi diplomat, whose death in a 1981 bombing in Beirut deeply affected him.
  He wrote extensively about his love for al-Rawi both before and after her death.
  Qabbani himself died in London in 1998 and was buried in Damascus. He is considered
  to be Syria’s national poet.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Leah Baxter is a senior in the College studying English, linguistics, and
  modern Middle Eastern studies. She has been studying Arabic for about four years,
  including briefly in Jordan through the Middlebury College language immersion program.
  She does not have any firm post-grad plans, but loves literary translation and hopes
  to continue her language study in the future. She loves reading, especially science
  fiction, and using postcards as wall decorations.</p>"
