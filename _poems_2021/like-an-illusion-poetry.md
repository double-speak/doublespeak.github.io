transtitle: Like An Illusion, Poetry
author: Kim Soon Mi
translator: Nadia Park
poem: "오월이 왔을 때\r\n환영처럼 \r\n시가 걸어 오는 모습이 보였다\r\n시낭송이 이어진 후\r\n시인들이 환대를 받았다\r\n창의문
  너머에 휘영창 달이 왔고\r\n늙은 감나무가 달빛을 받았다\r\n그때 수수밭 사이로\r\n시인의 실루엣이 보였다\r\n시가 올 것 같아\r\n가슴
  두근거렸다"
transpoem: "When May came,\r\nlike an illusion\r\nI saw poetry walking to me.\r\nAfter
  the reading,\r\npoets were warmly welcomed.\r\nThe glistening moon hanging \r\nover
  Changuimun Gate, \r\nits moonlight illuminating\r\nthe old persimmon tree.\r\nThen
  amid the sorghum field,\r\nI saw the poet’s silhouette.\r\nMy heart pounded,\r\nas
  though poetry had arrived."
note: "<p>Kim Soon Mi chooses words that often seem to float on their own, carrying
  a great deal of movement and feeling in each word that makes her poetry difficult
  to translate. This first poem I translated carries a sense of depression and desperation
  starting from the very first word, <span lang= \"ko\">과오로</span>. Is it a mistake?
  An error? A problem? A fault? A regret? I choose the word “mistake” because there
  can be a certain amount of sadness in this word, but there is nothing that can be
  done with what has happened in the past. There is only the option of moving forward
  with whatever is to come. Thus, when describing the actions of the shorebirds, there
  needed to be a desperation in the simple actions they were performing. As Kim states,
  her images of shorebirds are those of constant movement and a need to get from one
  point to the next, and felt this reflected her own life, especially when she most
  recently had depression. Furthermore, I took liberties in translation by adding
  more lines than the original, as I wanted to emphasize the desperation the narrator
  emits throughout the poem.</p>\r\n<p>“Like an illusion, poetry” was written as a
  moment in the year 2000 when Kim decided to become a poet. But the word, “illusion”
  was the most difficult word to translate. The word in English, coincidentally means
  “welcome” as well as “phantasm/illusion/fantasy.” Kim states that she did not intentionally
  choose this word, but it ultimately seemed to give readers that potential connection.
  Yet, when translating the poem, since we do not have a homophone word that holds
  both definitions, I wanted to focus on making sure the narrator was in a fantasy
  world, displaced from whatever current location they are in, and instead in a sort
  of mystical environment, where the moon would glow in vibrant color in an unbelievable
  size, and poetry would seem to be both present and somehow unattainable at the same
  time.</p>"
abio: "<p>Kim Soon Mi (1959–present) is a South Korean poet born in Uiseong in the
  Gyeongbuk region of South Korea. Kim’s way to becoming a poet was not always at
  the forefront of her professional aspirations. In elementary school, she wrote a
  poem that was ultimately framed in the hall of her school after she graduated. That
  moment gave her a sense of pride and expanded her love for poetry. While she attended
  university to become a kindergarten teacher, she always maintained her love for
  the arts, not just poetry. Obtaining inspiration to pursue poetry upon reading Joongang
  Daily’s “The Morning in Which There is Poetry” and having studied creative writing
  in a poetry class outside of standardized education along with a cultural class
  called “Scent of English Poetry,” she developed and continued to polish her art.
  She debuted in 2006 with the recommendation of poet Jung Il-geun and published her
  first poetry book, <em>The Woman of Chagall</em> in 2015, and will be publishing
  her second poetry book, <em>The Woman of Terrace</em>, in 2021.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Nadia Park graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2019 as a communications
  major and French and consumer psychology minor. She is currently living in South
  Korea for the first time and has been balancing life working between global marketing
  in an IT company and being a barista. As a former member of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>,
  she continues to fall back into the world of poetry and translation both consciously
  and unconsciously, discovering and encountering non-English poems and this year
  — a poet.</p>"
