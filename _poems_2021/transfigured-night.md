poem: "Zwei Menschen gehn durch kahlen, kalten Hain;\r\nder Mond läuft mit, sie schaun
  hinein.\r\nDer Mond läuft über hohe Eichen;\r\nkein Wölkchen trübt das Himmelslicht,\r\nin
  das die schwarzen Zacken reichen.\r\nDie Stimme eines Weibes spricht:\r\n\r\n“Ich
  trag ein Kind, und nit von Dir,\r\nich geh in Sünde neben Dir.\r\nIch hab mich schwer
  an mir vergangen.\r\nIch glaubte nicht mehr an ein Glück\r\nund hatte doch ein schwer
  Verlangen\r\nnach Lebensinhalt, nach Mutterglück\r\n\r\nund Pflicht; da hab ich
  mich erfrecht,\r\nda ließ ich schaudernd mein Geschlecht\r\nvon einem fremden Mann
  umfangen,\r\nund hab mich noch dafür gesegnet.\r\nNun hat das Leben sich gerächt:\r\nnun
  bin ich Dir, o Dir, begegnet.”\r\n\r\nSie geht mit ungelenkem Schritt.\r\nSie schaut
  empor; der Mond läuft mit.\r\nIhr dunkler Blick ertrinkt in Licht.\r\nDie Stimme
  eines Mannes spricht:\r\n\r\n“Das Kind, das Du empfangen hast,\r\nsei Deiner Seele
  keine Last,\r\no sieh, wie klar das Weltall schimmert!\r\nEs ist ein Glanz um alles
  her;\r\nDu treibst mit mir auf kaltem Meer,\r\ndoch eine eigne Wärme flimmert\r\nvon
  Dir in mich, von mir in Dich.\r\n\r\nDie wird das fremde Kind verklären,\r\nDu wirst
  es mir, von mir gebären;\r\nDu hast den Glanz in mich gebracht,\r\nDu hast mich
  selbst zum Kind gemacht.”\r\nEr faßt sie um die starken Hüften.\r\nIhr Atem küßt
  sich in den Lüften.\r\nZwei Menschen gehn durch hohe, helle Nacht."
transpoem: "Two people walk the cold, bare woods; \r\nThe moon keeps up with light
  that floods. \r\nThe moon moves over oak trees high; \r\nBelow, the black and jagged
  tips \r\nReach up into a cloudless sky. \r\nA woman’s voice escapes her lips: \r\n\r\n“I
  carry a child, and not by you.\r\nI walk here, sinful, next to you. \r\nAgainst
  myself I have conspired. \r\nI’d given up on all that’s good, \r\nYet heavily I
  still desired\r\nA life fulfilled, of motherhood  \r\n\r\nAnd duty. So in my disgrace,
  \r\nI gave myself to the embrace, \r\nShuddering, of a strange man — \r\nAnd thought
  it was a blessing, too. \r\nNow life has taken its revenge: \r\nNow here you are,
  now I’ve met you.”\r\n\r\nUncertainly, she stumbles on.\r\nShe looks above; she
  sees the moon. \r\nHer dark gaze drowns in light oblique.\r\nA man’s voice begins
  to speak:\r\n\r\n“Don’t let this child conceived in thee\r\nUpon your soul a burden
  be. \r\nLook, how the world is shining bright, \r\nGlory cast on everything! \r\nA
  cold sea we are traveling, \r\nBut warmly glows an inner light \r\nFrom you in me,
  from me in you.\r\n\r\nThat warmth will make this child shine,\r\nAnd you will bear
  him as if mine. \r\nThat glow upon me you invite; \r\nYou’ve filled me with a child’s
  delight.”\r\nHis arm around her sturdy hips, \r\nTheir breaths upon each other’s
  lips, \r\nTwo people walk the high, bright night."
note: "<p>“Verklärte Nacht,” written in 1896, is considered to be one of Richard Dehmel’s
  most memorable works — and in turn inspired Arnold Schoenberg to write one of his
  most well-known compositions in 1889. The poem depicts a man and woman as they walk
  through the forest; the woman confesses to carrying another man’s child, the man
  forgives her and welcomes the coming child as his own, and, in keeping with the
  poem’s title, the night is “transfigured.”</p>\r\n<p>Although other English translations
  of this poem already exist, I wanted to translate the poem in such a way as to preserve
  its original formal qualities — specifically, its meter and rhyme scheme. The ninth
  line of the original, in which the female speaker describes her desire to experience
  motherhood, translates to “I had a heavy longing.” The original word, <em>schwer</em>,
  which means both “heavy” and “burdensome,” seems to serve as a play on words evoking
  the notion of pregnancy. The poet appears to use pregnancy as a metaphor for the
  woman’s burdensome longing to become a mother, describing her longing as a heavy
  weight she carries. I chose to translate the word to “heavy” to convey both the
  weight of the speaker’s longing and the physical encumbrance of pregnancy — as in
  the English phrase “heavy with child.”</p>"
abio: "<p>Richard Dehmel is considered one of the greatest German poets of the period
  before the First World War. Despite his support for Germany’s war effort — as well
  as his decision to enlist in the German army in 1914 — Dehmel expressed strong progressive
  values throughout his career. He clashed with conservative poets, advocated for
  workers’ rights, and frequently portrayed love, sex, and eroticism in his poetry,
  for which he was prosecuted for blasphemy and obscenity on multiple occasions. His
  work embodied the cultural contradictions and historical juxtapositions of their
  author, contrasting frank depictions of sexuality and social issues with flawless
  execution of the conservative formal conventions of the time.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Jonathan Iwry graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> from the University of
  Pennsylvania with a BA in philosophy and history. He does occasional translations
  in memory of his grandmother, Nina Rochman Iwry, who did translations before the
  Second World War. In addition to speaking Hebrew, he has been teaching himself German
  over the course of the pandemic; this is his first translation from German into
  English.</p>"
