author: Arthur Rimbaud

poem: |
  Elle est retrouvée.
  Quoi? — L’Éternité.
  C’est la mer allée
  Avec le soleil.

   me sentinelle,
  Murmurons l’aveu
  De la nuit si nulle
  Et du jour en feu.

  Des humains suffrages
  Des communs élans
  Là tu dégages
  Et voles selon.

  Puisque de vous seules,
  Braises de satin,
  Le Devoir s’exhale
  Sans qu’on dise: enfin.

  Là pas d’espérance
  Nul orietur
  Science avec patience,
  La supplice est sûr.

  Elle est retrouvée.
  Quoi? — L’Éternité.
  C’est la mer allée
  Avec le soleil.
transpoem: "It is found anew.\nWhat? — Eternity.\n’Tis the sea that pursues\nThe sun’s
  infinity.\n\nOh, vigilant soul,\nSoftly we confess\nOf night’s empty hole\nAnd kindling
  day’s caress.\n\nFrom human praise\nFrom common desires\nYou part ways\nAnd still
  fly higher.\n\nSince from only you,\nEmbers of satin,\nDuty exhales through\nWith
  no end imagined.\n\nThere is no hope there, \nNor any rising\nReason and patience
  pare, \nTorment is on the horizon.\n\nIt is found again.\nWhat? — Eternity.\n’Tis
  the sea that pursues\nThe sun’s infinity. \n"

  <p>Arthur Rimbaud’s “Eternity,” published in May 1872, reflects a marked shift in the poet’s form and style, opting for a more subtle tone and delicate imagery to express his desire for spiritual rejuvenation. This follows a period of violent passion, jealousy, and guilt on account of his illicit relationship with fellow poet Paul Verlaine. More importantly, the poem represents a liminal stage in Rimbaud’s poetic career: the departure from poetic convention in the form of verse composition into the individual territory, where he pushed the boundaries of poetic structure and style through his later works. “Eternity” is a timeless depiction of an evanescent moment, the sunset at sea.</p>
  <p>The interplay of light and dark and the layered visual and aural imagery that Rimbaud uses to emphasize the abstract nature of the setting portrays eternity as an elusive yet tantalizing experience for the narrator. In keeping with this interpretation while consolidating the original form to the greatest extent possible, I chose to translate <em>allée</em>, which is literally translated as “gone” to “pursues.” By doing so, I aimed to characterize this scene between the sea and the sun as an eternal journey as opposed to an eternal destination for the narrator, thereby setting the stage for the flurry of observations and emotions that ensues. The sun also represents an object of rapture for the narrator, so I translated it in a manner that complements the transience of the moment: “the sun’s infinity” within an “Eternity.”</p>
  <p>In the second stanza, I translated <em>âme sentinelle</em> as “oh, vigilant soul,” as opposed to other translations describing a “guardian soul” or “sentinel soul,” as it seems to convey the soul as a better version of the narrator, one that sees more and understands more. This is better suited to Rimbaud’s character, which the narrator presumably reflects, in that the narrator emulates the soul, as Rimbaud intends to become a more idealized version of himself. This further supports my translation of the next line where <em>Murmurons l’aveu</em> becomes “Softly we confess,” a reluctant declaration between the narrator and the soul. The translation imbues the concept of eternity with an air of secrecy and provides further rationale for its elusive nature. The simple change between the next two lines, “night’s empty hole” and “kindling day’s caress,” further demarcates his past from that which he aims to be. By leaving his old self behind, Rimbaud shall “part ways” and “still fly higher,” thereby liberating himself from “human praise” (translated from <em>humains suffrages</em> — a poet’s success is derived from recognition of the quality of their work by others) and “common desires” (translated from <em>communs élans</em> — a pointed allusion to his relationship with Paul Verlaine).</p>
  <p>It is now in the fifth and sixth stanzas that Rimbaud speaks of the ill-fated future. I chose to interpret the final two lines, “Le Devoir s’exhale / Sans qu’on dise: enfin,” as Rimbaud foreseeing a futile struggle to live his current life and complete his duties as a poet with satisfaction, thus “Duty’s exhale blown / And no end imagined.” This is only made clearer in the sixth stanza, in which I translated <em>Là pas d’espérance</em> as “There is no hope there,” “there” being his future life as a poet, and <em>Nul orietur</em> as “Nor any rising.” The translation of the third line in the fifth stanza proved to be quite difficult as <em>orietur</em>, an old French noun derived from the Latin verb <em>orior</em>, loosely translated as “to emerge” or “to rise,” had little pertinence to the poem. Of its several meanings, I chose to define <em>orietur</em> as “rising” to express a double entendre with the physical rising of the sun and the spiritual rising of Rimbaud above his former, banal life. With the repetition of the first stanza in the last, Rimbaud emphasizes the derivative nature of eternity and, more importantly, the repetitive and seemingly unresolved struggle he had faced to achieve spiritual reform.</p>
abio: "<p>Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud (1854–1891) was a French poet renowned for his
  avant-garde works and later influence on modern literature and arts, which served
  as a precursor to the Surrealist movement that manifested in full force almost three
  decades after his death. Rimbaud is most notably remembered as a pioneer of the
  Symbolist movement in late nineteenth-century France that sought to push beyond
  the boundaries of realism and naturalism and infuse poetry with more imagination
  in the form of visions and dreams. Though this is perhaps best exemplified in his
  most famous poetry book <em>Une Saison en Enfer</em> (<em>A Season in Hell</em>,
  1873), the emergence of this style is first witnessed in Rimbaud’s smaller poetry
  collection <em>Derniers Vers</em> (1872). Rimbaud’s artful use of synaesthetic imagery
  and the subtle manipulation of color and tone with a few well-chosen words adds
  a layered conception to reality, an essence underlying the material world that is
  best seen and understood through powerful emotional responses. Rimbaud’s later shift
  to prose poetry coincided with his preference for a modernist art form; he kept
  this stance until he abandoned poetry altogether in 1875.</p>"

  Canada, studying in the faculty of health sciences. He enjoys the works of Romantic
  novelist Victor Hugo, postmodern novelist Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, and seventeenth-century
  playwright Molière. His interest in translating poetry stems from his belief that
  all languages have universal similarities and it is simply up to us to uncover them.</p>"
