transtitle: Epitaph For When I Die
author: Mariama Ndiaye
translator: Donnisa Edmonds
poem: "Quand je mourrai,\nNe pleurez pas\nIl faudra blanchir vos dents\nIl faudra
  prier pour que je vous quitte!\n \nQuand je mourrai,\nJe vous confierai mes enfants,\nApprenez
  leur à lire et à écrire,\nTraduisez leur les chants d’initiés,\nQu’ils se nourrissent
  de rêves et d’idéal,\nQu’ils prennent ma plume que j’ai prise\nLe soin de ne pas
  cacher.\n \nQuand je mourrai,\nPermettez à cette terre de Foundiougne\nDe couver
  mon sommeil éternel\nPriez pour que je demeure la nourrice\nDe ses entrailles.\n
  \nQuand je mourrai\nLisez mes écrits\nNe m’oubliez jamais.\n \nQuand je mourrai,\nVenez
  visiter ma tombe les vendredi, samedi et dimanche\nJe vous demanderai de fêter cet
  anniversaire,\nCe jour où la poétesse a embrassé\nLa fraîcheur de ces ombres éternelles.\n
  \nQuand je mourrai\nNe m’oubliez jamais,\nJe vous dédierai d’autres poèmes dans
  ma tombe\nCar au royaume des cieux je continuerai\nA écrire pour vous.\n\n<h1>Femmes</h1>\n\n<i>A
  toute mes soeurs qui souffrent loin de moi</i>\n\nFemmes africaines !\nFemmes de
  savanes et de la steppe ! \nFemmes des régions libérées ! \nFemmes de la Guinée
  Bissau, femmes d’Afrique ! \n\nVous avez aimé devant la rougeur de feux, \nSous
  le silence de l’ennemi, \nVous avez donné vie sous les crépitements des mitrailleuses\nVous
  les sœurs opprimées, vous qui gardez dans vos entailles \nLe visage de l’Afrique
  immortelle ! \nVous ne pourrez être oubliées, ni décolorées. \n\nVous avez nourri
  l’Afrique de votre sève\nVotre peau d’ébène a refusé la caresse du colonisateur.
  \n\nFemmes africaines ! \nBelles femmes à la peau sombre\nAcceptez la demande de
  votre sœur du Sénégal. \n\nBelles femmes noires \nAux destinées éternelles, \nEnrôle
  dans vos brigades\nJe mettrai l’uniforme du refus, \nJe participerai à vos simulacres\nDe
  combat, et je crierai : \n\nVIVE L’AFRIQUE LIBRE ! "
transpoem: "When I die,\nYou must whiten your teeth,\nYou must pray so that I leave!\n
  \nWhen I die,\nI will entrust to you my children,\nTeach them to read and write,\nShow
  them the songs of the enlightened, \nSo that they nourish themselves with dream
  and goals,\nSo that they take my quill that I prize\nThe care not to hide.\n \nWhen
  I die,\nAllow this earth of Foundiougne\nTo swathe my eternal slumber\nPray so that
  I remain the caretaker\nOf its depths.\n \nWhen I die\nRead my writings\nNever forget
  me.\n \nWhen I die,\nCome to visit my tomb on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays\nI
  will ask you to celebrate this anniversary,\nThis day where the poetess embraced\nThe
  coolness of these eternal shadows.\n \nWhen I die\nNever forget me,\nI will dedicate
  to you the other poems in my tomb\nBecause in the kingdom of heaven I will continue\nTo
  write for you.\n\n<h1>women</h1>\n<i>To all my sisters who suffer far from me</i>\n\nWomen
  of Africa! \nWomen of the Savanah and the Plain! \nWomen of the liberated regions!
  \nWomen of the Guinea-Bissau, women of Africa! \n\nYou have loved before the blush
  of fire, \nUnder the silence of the enemy, \nYou have given life under the sputter
  of machine guns, \nYou the sisters oppressed, you who guard in your womb, \nThe
  face of the immortal Africa! \nYou will not be neither forgotten, nor left to fade.
  \n\nYou have fed Africa from your lifeblood\nYour skin of ebony refuses the caress
  of the colonizer. \n\nWomen of Africa! \nBeautiful women with dark skin \nAccept
  the request of your sister from Senegal. \n\nBeautiful black women \nTo your enteral
  destinies, \nEnlist in your brigades\nI will put on the uniform of refusal, \nI
  will participate in your mockery\nOf combat, and I will cry: \n\nLONG LIVE THE LIBERATED
  AFRICA! "
note: |-
  <p>Of the few poems I’ve translated in my life, this was definitely the most challenging. Ndiaye utilizes a lot of great imagery throughout the poem related to being the nurse or caretaker of someone that was difficult to translate directly. For example, <em>de couver</em> in the line “de couver mon sommeil éternel” translates most directly to “to wrap a child in cotton wool.” I tried to preserve this notion through the use of the word “swathe,” which similarly refers to the idea of wrapping a baby in fabric. I also struggled with the line “to care not to hide.” This translation originally did not make much sense to me within the context of the poem, so I tried many different versions and arrangements. However, I continued to come back to this most direct translation of Ndiaye’s words. I feel like it allows the most room for interpretation of her meaning without my own personal inputs. I maintain her punctuation, line breaks, and structure throughout the entire poem, along with the repetition of “When I Die.”</p>
  <p>Three years ago, I translated the poem “Femme Noir” by Léopold Senghor for the 2018 edition of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>. When I found this poem by Ndiaye, I felt that it was a near perfect follow-up to my first translation, as it offers both a call to arms and love for Black women (specifically those from Africa) from the perspective of a Black woman. I tried my best to maintain the high-energy and fast-paced nature of the poem in my translation by keeping the lines to a similar length and retaining the same punctuation and structure. I also chose to translate all of the lines starting with <em>femme</em> as “Women of” to add repetition to the poem to keep it moving forward. I also tried to as closely as possible preserve the meanings of the more descriptive words like <em>crépitements</em>, which directly translates to “the crackling of machine guns.” However, I chose to use the word “sputter” in my translation because I felt it more accurately captured in English the sound she was trying to evoke. Similarly, while <em>ni decolorées</em> literally translates to “neither faded,” the line was difficult to translate as there is no meaningful English equivalent to this use of the past tense. I opted to use the phrase “left to fade,” as I believe it more accurately captures the feeling of the original line. Finally, I sifted through several different English translation of the line: “VIVE L’AFRIQUE LIBRE” (“long live free Africa,” “God bless free Africa,” etc.), but ultimate settled on translating <em>libre</em> as “liberated” as it felt like it carried the most nuanced understanding of what it means for Africa and Black women to be free.</p>
