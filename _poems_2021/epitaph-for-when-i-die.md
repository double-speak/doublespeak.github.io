author: Mariama Ndiaye
translator: Donnisa Edmonds
poem: "Quand je mourrai,\r\nNe pleurez pas\r\nIl faudra blanchir vos dents\r\nIl faudra
  prier pour que je vous quitte!\r\n \r\nQuand je mourrai,\r\nJe vous confierai mes
  enfants,\r\nApprenez leur à lire et à écrire,\r\nTraduisez leur les chants d’initiés,\r\nQu’ils
  se nourrissent de rêves et d’idéal,\r\nQu’ils prennent ma plume que j’ai prise\r\nLe
  soin de ne pas cacher.\r\n \r\nQuand je mourrai,\r\nPermettez à cette terre de Foundiougne\r\nDe
  couver mon sommeil éternel\r\nPriez pour que je demeure la nourrice\r\nDe ses entrailles.\r\n
  \r\nQuand je mourrai\r\nLisez mes écrits\r\nNe m’oubliez jamais.\r\n \r\nQuand je
  mourrai,\r\nVenez visiter ma tombe les vendredi, \r\nsamedi et dimanche\r\nJe vous
  demanderai de fêter cet anniversaire,\r\nCe jour où la poétesse a embrassé\r\nLa
  fraîcheur de ces ombres éternelles.\r\n \r\nQuand je mourrai\r\nNe m’oubliez jamais,\r\nJe
  vous dédierai d’autres poèmes \r\ndans ma tombe\r\nCar au royaume des cieux je continuerai\r\nA
  écrire pour vous."
transpoem: "When I die,\r\nYou must whiten your teeth,\r\nYou must pray so that I
  leave!\r\n \r\nWhen I die,\r\nI will entrust to you my children,\r\nTeach them to
  read and write,\r\nShow them the songs of the enlightened, \r\nSo that they nourish
  themselves with \r\ndream and goals,\r\nSo that they take my quill that I prize\r\nThe
  care not to hide.\r\n \r\nWhen I die,\r\nAllow this earth of Foundiougne\r\nTo swathe
  my eternal slumber\r\nPray so that I remain the caretaker\r\nOf its depths.\r\n
  \r\nWhen I die\r\nRead my writings\r\nNever forget me.\r\n \r\nWhen I die,\r\nCome
  to visit my tomb on Fridays, \r\nSaturdays and Sundays\r\nI will ask you to celebrate
  this anniversary,\r\nThis day where the poetess embraced\r\nThe coolness of these
  eternal shadows.\r\n \r\nWhen I die\r\nNever forget me,\r\nI will dedicate to you
  the other poems in my tomb\r\nBecause in the kingdom of heaven I will continue\r\nTo
  write for you."
note: "<p>Of the few poems I’ve translated in my life, this was definitely the most
  challenging. Ndiaye utilizes a lot of great imagery throughout the poem related
  to being the nurse or caretaker of someone that was difficult to translate directly.
  For example, <em>de couver</em> in the line “de couver mon sommeil éternel” translates
  most directly to “to wrap a child in cotton wool.” I tried to preserve this notion
  through the use of the word “swathe,” which similarly refers to the idea of wrapping
  a baby in fabric. I also struggled with the line “to care not to hide.” This translation
  originally did not make much sense to me within the context of the poem, so I tried
  many different versions and arrangements. However, I continued to come back to this
  most direct translation of Ndiaye’s words. I feel like it allows the most room for
  interpretation of her meaning without my own personal inputs. I maintain her punctuation,
  line breaks, and structure throughout the entire poem, along with the repetition
  of “When I Die.”</p>\r\n<p>Three years ago, I translated the poem “Femme Noir” by
  Léopold Senghor for the 2018 edition of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>. When I found this
  poem by Ndiaye, I felt that it was a near perfect follow-up to my first translation,
  as it offers both a call to arms and love for Black women (specifically those from
  Africa) from the perspective of a Black woman. I tried my best to maintain the high-energy
  and fast-paced nature of the poem in my translation by keeping the lines to a similar
  length and retaining the same punctuation and structure. I also chose to translate
  all of the lines starting with <em>femme</em> as “Women of” to add repetition to
  the poem to keep it moving forward. I also tried to as closely as possible preserve
  the meanings of the more descriptive words like <em>crépitements</em>, which directly
  translates to “the crackling of machine guns.” However, I chose to use the word
  “sputter” in my translation because I felt it more accurately captured in English
  the sound she was trying to evoke. Similarly, while <em>ni decolorées</em> literally
  translates to “neither faded,” the line was difficult to translate as there is no
  meaningful English equivalent to this use of the past tense. I opted to use the
  phrase “left to fade,” as I believe it more accurately captures the feeling of the
  original line. Finally, I sifted through several different English translation of
  the line: “VIVE L’AFRIQUE LIBRE” (“long live free Africa,” “God bless free Africa,”
  etc.), but ultimate settled on translating <em>libre</em> as “liberated” as it felt
  like it carried the most nuanced understanding of what it means for Africa and Black
  women to be free.</p>"
