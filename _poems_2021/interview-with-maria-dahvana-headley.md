  The first question for today is: What got you interested in translation, and how
  do you see this influencing your work as a writer?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Maria Dahvana
  Headley:</strong> Well, I came about this through a sort of backward path. I wrote
  a novel based on <em>Beowulf</em>, which is called <em>The Mere Wife</em>, set in
  contemporary America from the POV of the female characters. When <em>The Mere Wife</em>
  was about to come out, I gave a reading from it at a conference. In the Q&A, I was
  talking about all the translations I read, specifically Tolkien’s translation, and
  said, “Oh, you know, some of them were really sexist. They make Grendel’s mother
  into an emphatic, unmistakable monster.” And, someone in the audience raised their
  hand and said, “When is your translation coming out? You’re obviously doing one.”
  And, I said, “I’m not doing that.” And, then I thought about it for a few days and
  thought, “Well, maybe.”</p>\n\n<p>Tolkien’s translation uses a lot of language that
  is archaic, but I thought while reading it, this is a “bro” story, a story in which
  there’s tons of masculine bragging. I saw a path to use a lot of contemporary language
  alongside the archaic. When I sold this translation, I said to my editor, “I want
  to translate <em>Beowulf</em>. I know that’s crazy, but I want to do it. I’ll translate
  the first word, the legendary <em>hwæt</em>, which is often translated as ‘hark’
  or ‘lo’ or Seamus Heaney’s legendary ‘so,’ as ‘bro’ and use that to lead us to a
  POV for opening the story.” In terms of getting the floor and establishing a character
  perspective within the material through translation, I thought that “bro” was a
  way to do that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DS:</strong> That’s very cool. I think I’m really
  fascinated by the opening with the word “bro” and also the idea that you mentioned
  in your introduction, which is the mixing of archaic words and new words as if dropping
  fossils next to newborns. I really loved this metaphor and the idea of putting words
  together that seem to come from different historical periods but make sense to us
  with a sense of universality and timelessness. Can you tell us more about that?</p>\n\n<p><strong>MDH:</strong>
  Yeah, I did that consciously. I wanted to give us a tour through 1300 years of the
  English language. Old English evolved into contemporary English, but not always
  in the ways that we would think. It’s a really interesting trove, and it has words
  that have transformed almost perfectly into their contemporary equivalents and words
  that are really different. So, I wanted to use this translation to think about storytelling
  through history and the ways in which we communicate idioms and communicate references
  to historical events in order to create understanding across cultures.</p>\n\n<p>There’s
  a way to do this translation entirely in contemporary slang, like a translation
  of the twenty-first century, but the twenty-first century is  a compendium of everything
  that came before it. That’s something that’s always been really meaningful to me
  when thinking about history, especially the history of power structures and unfair
  status grabs. I think we tend to be like, “No, we’re just free-standing here in
  <em>our</em> time.” We don’t want to think about what our history has created for
  us.</p>\n\n<p>So, I wanted to think about the history of poetic language and storytelling,
  which is also why I use some obscenity in the poem. Of course, obscenity isn’t a
  modern invention. It’s been around the whole time that humans have been around.
  In my opinion, most of the time, obscenity is really direct poetic language because
  it’s not used literally. If we’re saying “fuck,” we usually don’t mean what that
  <em>literally</em> means. It’s a perfect example of a word that holds within it
  some interesting baggage and that holds within it a deeper well of accrued meaning.
  That’s why I used it here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DS:</strong> I was struck by what you
  mentioned about how <em>Beowulf</em>, even though it is like an imagined story,
  is sometimes viewed as a historical text to a certain extent. What do you think
  about <em>Beowulf</em>’s relationship to history, and how does the historicization
  of <em>Beowulf</em> impact our view of its function and cultural role?</p>\n\n<p><strong>MDH:</strong>
  Well, it’s interesting because, just a few weeks ago, the legendary-in-a-bad-way
  Rudy Giuliani referred to <em>Game of Thrones</em> as a documentary. The whole thing
  reflects a fairly typical confusion between poetic material and actuality, and the
  idea that poetic material, which is heightened and in this case fully inflated with
  dragons, can be used to justify real-world questionable acts. “I’m allowed to call
  for trial by combat because in this documentary I saw, <em>Game of Thrones</em>,
  it happened that way.” <em>Beowulf</em> is also really relevant to those events
  of January 6th at the Capitol, in terms of people appropriating what they saw to
  be a historically-documented version of white nationalist success. That’s a misread
  — it’s not the case with this material at all.</p>\n\n<p>So, misreading poetic material
  as history while simultaneously neglecting the actual history is problematic. I
  also think that poetic material is really relevant. It is our emotional history.
  It tells us about desire and about yearning for a way to engage with status. In
  the case of monster-fighting mythology, if you fight a monster, you can acquire
  power that you wouldn’t otherwise have built. We have that in our culture already,
  of course. We have the idea of the bootstrap narrative, where you come from nothing
  and no one and become the king of the country. People even employ that sort of mythological
  language to speak about themselves. Trump does it all the time. He speaks about
  himself as a hero who came from no one, nobody, and nothing — all of which is a
  big lie. He came from money, privilege, and power via his father. But he uses the
  American Dream mythology to describe his own imaginary folkloric narrative, erasing
  the patriarchal structure that he’s massively benefiting from. I think about using
  these kinds of materials — i.e. thousand-year-old poetry — to point out that “legendary”
  language has frequently been created to support existing power structures. We can
  see the same power language in <em>Beowulf</em> that we see today.</p>\n\n<p>I think
  about how, in our time, everyone stands on a little virtual soapbox, giving their
  own, often highly poetry-infused versions of events, going “I’m the hero.” We have
  an entire society of “heroes,” all at odds, because the reality is that you can’t
  be a hero professionally for your whole life. A hero can only exist in a moment,
  in an action. I think that the notion of heroism is just a question of whether you’re
  trying to do it because of the status and the legacy and wanting a statue made of
  you. Part of what I think people raging over the knocking down of statues has been
  is people imagining their own legacy status signifiers being knocked down. So, it’s
  that performing “heroic” acts for your own status, or it’s something else, changing
  the world in discrete moments and then going about your business, not expecting
  there to be a poem or a <em>Game of Thrones</em>–style ”documentary” that you starred
  in. I can think of a lot of people who’ve been heroic but weren’t seen as heroes
  in their lifetime, like Shirley Chisholm. There should be an epic poem about Shirley
  Chisholm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DS:</strong> Something that you said really stood out
  to me. I’ve been taking a course about memorialization and how we as humans respond
  to tragedy or important events. We can either sanctify it by building memorials
  or statues or we can ignore it. I think you mentioned the tearing down of statues
  since we’re recognizing that these people were flawed and had their own personal
  histories. How do you see literature or the translation of these huge texts as part
  of that memorialization process…of how we remember the past and, in a sense, how
  we remember the present?</p>\n\n<p><strong>MDH:</strong> <em>Beowulf</em> is one
  of those “it’s lasted this long” kind of stories. I think that the history of the
  way we’ve depicted power is really relevant to the way that we continue to depict
  power relationships. We look to the past for guidance, sure, but it’s our responsibility
  to look more deeply than we often have. The only way to change the nature of these
  depictions is to understand and analyze where we started. Change isn’t always  predictable,
  but by and large, it comes from the critical mass of years of re-analysis and hard
  work done by people with passion. I think these texts are important, <em>and</em>
  I think it’s important to transgress against the unspoken rules of “dignified” and
  inaccessible translation for important texts. I think it’s also crucial to expand
  the definition of <em>important</em>. I did it this way because I thought this text
  was right for a contemporary translation that pointed out tropes of toxic masculinity,
  as well as pointing out the translation history of minimizing and monsterizing marginalized
  characters. I could do a translation like this partially because I came from outside
  of academia. I wasn’t under the thumb of anyone who could tell me I wasn’t allowed
  to do it like this, that I’d be breaking unbreakable rules of tradition. When it
  was about to come out, there were a few days where I was like, “Oh, no, it’s going
  to be so bad.” But, instead, many people in the world of medieval literature were
  ready for this kind of translation. It’s just all part of a big collective project
  of looking at what’s important and also acknowledging that there are always more
  perspectives than the ones that have been analyzed. And, thinking about gaps, particularly
  in the old texts, is a useful thing, in terms of bringing them into the present.
  \ Some of the work I want to be doing with a translation like this one is filling
  in the assumed gaps, the subtext, things that would’ve been conveyed in tone, and
  in knowing gestures by a <em>scop</em> performing it, and also filling in the places
  where the knowledge of the past has been erased. I’m always looking to help create
  deeper understanding across generations, cultures, and histories.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DS:</strong>
  I think you mentioned in the introduction that it’s like retelling stories with
  the full spectrum of humanity; I really loved the way you phrased that because this
  isn’t the last translation of <em>Beowulf</em> to exist. It’s a part of this huge
  narrative. Just speaking on the translation process in general, what is that like
  for you? How do you interact with the original text? You’ve created lots of interesting
  images, especially with the cowboy poets. How did this all come about and how does
  it work for you?</p>\n\n<p><strong>MDH:</strong> Well, the way that I did this translation
  is that I did a lot of research over the course of <em>The Mere Wife</em>. I did
  my own literal translation line by line with the assistance of a pile of scholarship
  as well as nearly two hundred years worth of translations, seeing what a variety
  of people have thought about this material, and then I converted the literal chunks
  into the poetic voice that I used in this translation. I was translating myself,
  essentially, into meter, rhyme, and alliterative rhythm. I wasn’t sure throughout
  the early part of doing this if I wanted to replicate the old English meter. It
  doesn’t work with contemporary English in the way that you want it to work. So,
  I went through it, really grooming it for intelligibility, story, and POV. I created
  the personality of the narrator, which comes from suggestions in the text. I was
  interested in the kind of person that would do that in a kind of a bro tall-tale
  register. Some people think that this was an oral performance that was transcribed
  with consistent recaps that happen throughout the story. I decided to put the translation
  in the oral storytelling register, rather than in the register of the highbrow written
  word, which is often how it is translated. Miz Cracker, a drag queen who studied
  Old English, read the first chunk of this <em>Beowulf</em> in a group reading and
  said that it reminded her of drag storytelling, standing on a table, trying to get
  a room full of drunk people to pay attention.</p>\n\n<p>I was also going for a story
  that entwined the last line with the next line, so I did rhymes and alliterations
  that jumped from line to line, and sometimes callbacks, so that you can remember
  what happened ten lines ago. I did a lot of things in service of keeping the story
  moving, so that reading it aloud would be as fun or more fun than reading it on
  the page. I wanted it to be something that you could imagine being performed, a
  story about something complicated that happened a long time ago, but relevant to
  our time. I tried my best to make these ancient kings feel like people we know.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DS:</strong>
  Yeah, I think the storytelling process and translating yourself into it is something
  that I think will help me a lot. I was thinking of translating some Ancient Chinese
  poems but kind of like the old English poems, the rhythm is really strict and I
  find it hard to express them in coherent English sentences. Just as a wrap-up question,
  do you have any advice for us at <em>DoubleSpeak</em> or to other students or new
  translators?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Taije Silverman:</strong> Just to add to your question,
  when you were talking about why you decided to translate this in the first place,
  you mentioned these two women who said, “You should translate this.” And <em>DoubleSpeak</em>
  is run by women and non-binary people and mostly people of color from all over the
  world. It is not a male power. So just like piggybacking on that, how did you find
  your company? How did you know that those women were your women and that you should
  listen to them, and how did you get them to speak to you like that?</p>\n\n<p><strong>MDH:</strong>
  So, advice-wise, it’s all entwined with the concept that people will constantly
  try to tell you what you’re not allowed to do. My policy has pretty much always
  been to do it anyway. Years ago, I was trying to create a project where thirty-seven
  female and non-binary playwrights wrote new versions of all of Shakespeare’s plays.
  This was in 2009, and I was a little early. Theaters said, “Well, what if they aren’t
  good?” There was an attitude in some places that felt like, “This is Shakespeare.
  It’s too precious to be touched by your potentially dirty fingers.” And I’m like,
  Shakespeare isn’t God. No one is erasing Shakespeare by interpreting his work and
  adapting it into new art for new times. All that is happening is that more art is
  being made. I think, for people who are not cis, straight, white men, the world
  doesn’t tell you that you’re allowed to do your work. But yeah, no one typically
  gives you permission. No one tells you that you <em>can</em> do it, not usually
  — so at the beginning, anyway, you have to start giving yourself permission to transgress,
  to believe in the validity of your perspective, to do your own best and most difficult
  work. So, I think that just doing the challenging transgressive work yourself and
  by doing that, getting a sense of what you’re capable of, is the best advice that
  I can give.</p>\n\n<p>And then, in contrast to that story, relatedly and luckily,
  there were several women who helped me realize I could and should do this translation.
  Two of the women who were judging the World Fantasy Awards, Betsy Mitchell and Elizabeth
  Engstom, gave me the idea to do this. I was a finalist for the award, and they came
  to my reading because they’d liked my story. From it, I guess, they had a sense
  that I could do this work. It hadn’t occurred to me to do this translation, even
  though I was just about to publish a novel all about <em>Beowulf</em>. I still thought
  I couldn’t do a translation because I didn’t have a PhD, and I wasn’t Seamus Heaney.
  But, soon after that, I took the idea of the translation to a writing retreat with
  a bunch of women writers, and all of them were like, “You have to do it <em>now</em>.”
  Once I started thinking about the ways that restrictions had been imposed on women,
  but also, and with increasing severity, on BIPOC and LGBTQ translators, I started
  thinking, “I’m going to stick my foot in that door and keep it there and see how
  many other people I can let in.” It’s part of my goal to help people realize that
  they can go through the same door that I went through.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TS:</strong>
  Has your rage changed?</p>\n\n<p><strong>MDH:</strong> Initially, the rage that
  helped me become a writer was a sputtering rage. Now, my rage goes into my work,
  which is pretty satisfying. I feel like I can be part of the tradition of storytelling
  and changing the world in this way.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve also been changed by having a
  baby who’s a year-and-a-half old. I started talking loudly about doing the work
  of changing the world with a story while I was pregnant with him and while he was
  a newborn. Having a small child changes things, but it also brings different perspectives.
  Having my child as I was deep in working on the <em>Beowulf</em> poem brought a
  totally different perspective to the translation. I was deep in the idea of Grendel’s
  mother, grieving the potential loss of a child, and that’s a big part of what this
  poem is about. I got a new window into it. So, the things that I lost in terms of
  my ability to just write all day, I gained in my ability to see through the eyes
  of the mothers in the <em>Beowulf</em> story.</p>"
