author: Eunice Odio
translator: Couloir Hanson
poem: "I\r\nEstoy sola,\r\nmuy sola,\r\nentre mi cintura y mi vestido,\r\nsola entre
  mi voz entera,\r\ncon una carga de ángeles menudos\r\ncomo esas caricias\r\nque
  se desploman solas en los dedos.\r\nEntre mi pelo, a la deriva,\r\nun remero azul,\r\nconfundido,\r\nbusca
  un niño de arena.\r\nSosteniendo sus tribus de olores\r\ncon un hilo pálido,\r\ncontra
  un perfil de rosa,\r\nen el rincón más quieto de mis párpados\r\ntrece peregrinos
  se agolpan.\r\n\r\nII\r\nArqueándome ligeramente\r\nsobre mi corazón de piedra en
  flor\r\npara verlo,\r\npara calzarme sus arterias y mi voz\r\nen un momento dado\r\nen
  que alguien venga,\r\ny me llame…\r\npero ahora que no me llame nadie,\r\nque no
  quepo en la voz de nadie,\r\nque no me llamen,\r\nporque estoy bajando al fondo
  de mi pequeñez,\r\na la raíz complacida de mi sombra,\r\nporque ahora estoy bajando
  al agónico\r\ntacto de un minero, con su media flor al hombro,\r\ny una gran letra
  de te quiero al cinto.\r\nY bajo más,\r\na las inmediaciones del aire\r\nque aligerado
  espera las letras de su nombre\r\npara nacer perfecto y habitable.\r\nBajo,\r\ndesciendo
  mucho más,\r\n¿quién me encontrará?\r\nMe calzo mis arterias\r\n(qué gran prisa
  tengo),\r\nme calzo mis arterias y mi voz,\r\nme pongo mi corazón de piedra en flor,\r\npara
  que en un momento dado\r\nalguien venga,\r\ny me llame,\r\ny no esté yo\r\nligeramente
  arqueada sobre mi corazón, para verlo.\r\ny no tenga yo que irme y dejar mi gran
  voz,\r\ny mi alto corazón\r\nde piedra en flor.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
transpoem: "I\r\nI am alone,\r\nvery alone,\r\nbetween my waist and my dress,\r\nalone
  among my entire voice,\r\nwith a charge of fragile angels\r\nlike those caresses\r\nthat
  collapse by themselves in the fingers.\r\nIn my hair, adrift,\r\na blue rower,\r\nconfused,\r\nseeks
  a boy of sand.\r\nHolding his tribes of smells\r\nwith a pale thread,\r\nagainst
  a silhouette of roses,\r\nin the quietest corner of my eyelids\r\nthirteen pilgrims
  jostle against each other.\r\n\r\nII\r\nArching myself lightly\r\nover my heart
  of stone in bloom\r\nto see it,\r\nto tailor his arteries and my voice\r\nin a given
  moment\r\nin that someone comes,\r\nand calls me…\r\nbut now please no one call
  me,\r\nI no longer fit in anyone’s voice,\r\nplease no one call me,\r\nbecause I
  am sinking to the depths of my smallness,\r\nto the satisfied root of my shadow,\r\nbecause
  now I am descending to the agonizing\r\ntouch of a miner, with his half flower at
  the shoulder,\r\nand a great letter of I want you at the waist.\r\nAnd I fall farther,\r\ninto
  the immediacies of the air\r\nthat lightened awaits the letters of his name\r\nto
  be born perfect and inhabitable.\r\nLower,\r\nI descend much more,\r\nwho will find
  me?\r\nI wear my arteries\r\n(what great haste I have),\r\nI wear my arteries and
  my voice,\r\nI don my heart of stone in bloom,\r\nso that in a given moment\r\nsomeone
  would come,\r\nand call for me,\r\nand I won’t be\r\nlightly arched over my heart,
  to see it.\r\nand I won’t have to go and leave my great voice,\r\nand my high heart\r\nof
  stone in bloom."
note: "<p>Throughout her entire <em>oeuvre</em>, Odio plays with similar themes. In
  her earlier work, Odio analyzes the relationship between the lover and the beloved.
  In later poems, Odio will go on to explore the relationship between the creator
  and the created. In Odio’s mind, creation is linked to sacred poetic language, which
  engenders a new reality. Hence, throughout her poetry, Odio includes biblical allusions,
  such as the “thirteen pilgrims.” She also plays with common epic tropes, such as
  embarking on a descending journey to bring healing and order in many poems, including
  <em>Declinaciones del monólogo</em> and <em>El tránsito de fuego: Parte II</em>.
  The erotic, as seen in <em>Declinaciones del monólogo</em>, plays a central role
  in Odio’s poetry. Through the erotic, Odio discusses the relationship between sexuality,
  the poetic body, and existential awareness. By touching upon the physical, she also
  transgresses the limits of conventional love poetry, becoming at once incredibly
  avant-garde yet also completely rooted in her humanity.</p>\r\n<p>In two parts of
  Declinaciones del monólogo, Odio writes of <em>calzarme,</em> be it “calzarme sus
  arterias y mi voz” or “me calzo mis arterias (y mi voz).” <em>Calzar</em> brings
  two images to my mind: fitting feet into shoes or fitting puzzle pieces together.
  In the first rendition of “calzarme sus arterias y mi voz,” the lyric “I” speaks
  of fitting disparate pieces together, of his and of mine, a combination that cannot
  last. She is also speaking of it passively, in the infinitive form. In this spirit,
  the image of tailoring these two pieces together came to me: they will synthetically
  fit on the lyric “I,” but not organically. In the second use of “me calzo mis arterias
  y mi voz,” the lyric “I” takes agency over her own veins and voice, reflected in
  the conjugated verb form. I highlight this evolution in agency by translating <em>me
  calzo</em> this time as “I wear.” Immediately below, I translate <em>me pongo</em>
  as “I don,” which is both a literal translation (albeit a rather old-fashioned one)
  and a translingual pun — in Spanish, <em>don</em> is an honorific derived from Latin
  <em>dominus</em>, master of a household. In this context, <em>don</em> places additional
  emphasis on the mastery of the lyric “I” over herself.</p>\r\n<p>In Spanish, you
  can express a desire in a commanding tone by using constructions like “que no me
  llamen.” In translating this forceful wish into English, I thought of it as “please
  no one call me,” highlighting the vulnerability and intensity of the lyric “I.”</p>\r\nThe
  most common translation of “I like you” into Spanish is <em>te quiero</em> — to
  me, it is also one of the most careless. <em>Te quiero</em> connotes “I want you”
  and “I’m fond of you.” In attempting to transmit Odio’s erotic spirit as well as
  this poem’s struggle between love and independence, I opted for the “I want you”
  variation.</p>\r\n<p>In all her poems, Odio plays with the different genders words
  have in Spanish. In this poem, the salient example is <i>el aire</i>, “the (masculine)
  air.” He links the human with the eternal: immediate, waiting, and about to become
  reborn. A counterpart to the lyric “I,” a masculine to her feminine. Thus, I emphasized
  the air’s masculinity in my translation (“the letters of <strong>his</strong> name”),
  subtly alluded to in the original through Odio’s purposeful use of <i>de <strong>l</strong>
  aire</i> as opposed to a possible <i>de aire</i> (deliberately including the implied
  masculine “l”), and the gendered adjectives <em>aligerad<strong>o</strong></em>
  and <em>perfect<strong>o</strong></em>.</p> "
abio: "<p>Eunice Odio (1919–1974) detested biographies. “The affairs of my private
  life are the most private and, in general, no one knows them, except me.” Even so,
  I will attempt to provide a brief sketch of Odio’s lives — both the inner poetic
  life she constructed and the outer tragedy she lived — to better color her work.</p>\r\n<p>Octavio
  Paz once told Odio that she was “of that line of poets who invent their own mythology,
  like Blake, like St. John Perse, like Ezra Pound; and they are rubbed out, because
  no one understands them until years or even centuries after their death.” And as
  mythological Odio’s writing certainly is: she plays with language and gender and
  reality, often relaying her own mystical experiences in her poetry, inspired by
  old epics.</p>\r\n<p>Odio’s biography is impossible to extricate from her own personal
  mythology. For the longest time, scholars believed her birth year to have been 1922,
  perhaps due to Odio’s coquetry, until it was discovered that Odio had in fact been
  born in 1919. Her own death is even further shrouded in mystery: she was found ten
  days after her death, alone, in her bathtub in Mexico sometime in 1974; the exact
  date is uncertain. Suspicions as to how she died abound: suicide by venom, an accidental
  slip in the tub, assassination. The one certainty from Odio’s life is that she migrated
  from Costa Rica northward, seeking a home for her fierce individuality and expression.
  She never found it.</p>\r\n"
tbio: "<p>Couloir X. Hanson is a daughter of three worlds: Costa Rica, Germany, and
  the United States. Her favorite authors are magical realists, like Juan Rulfo and
  Julio Cortázar and Gabriel García Márquez — authors who challenge objective reality.
  Couloir first read Eunice Odio when writing her high school thesis partially on
  Odio’s <em>Tercer poema (Consumación)</em> and has been haunted by Odio’s mythological
  poetry ever since. In her free time, Couloir enjoys picking wildflowers, playing
  chess, and singing opera. After graduating from Penn, Couloir will work in real
  estate, where she hopes to use her whimsy to see what is and imagine what could
  be.</p>"
