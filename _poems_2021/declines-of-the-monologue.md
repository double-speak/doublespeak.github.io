  I
  Estoy sola,
  muy sola,
  entre mi cintura y mi vestido,
  sola entre mi voz entera,
  con una carga de ángeles menudos
  como esas caricias
  que se desploman solas en los dedos.
  Entre mi pelo, a la deriva,
  un remero azul,
  confundido,
  busca un niño de arena.
  Sosteniendo sus tribus de olores
  con un hilo pálido,
  contra un perfil de rosa,
  en el rincón más quieto de mis párpados
  trece peregrinos se agolpan.

  II
  Arqueándome ligeramente
  sobre mi corazón de piedra en flor
  para verlo,
  para calzarme sus arterias y mi voz
  en un momento dado
  en que alguien venga,
  y me llame…
  pero ahora que no me llame nadie,
  que no quepo en la voz de nadie,
  que no me llamen,
  porque estoy bajando al fondo de mi pequeñez,
  a la raíz complacida de mi sombra,
  porque ahora estoy bajando al agónico
  tacto de un minero, con su media flor al hombro,
  y una gran letra de te quiero al cinto.
  Y bajo más,
  a las inmediaciones del aire
  que aligerado espera las letras de su nombre
  para nacer perfecto y habitable.
  Bajo,
  desciendo mucho más,
  ¿quién me encontrará?
  Me calzo mis arterias
  (qué gran prisa tengo),
  me calzo mis arterias y mi voz,
  me pongo mi corazón de piedra en flor,
  para que en un momento dado
  alguien venga,
  y me llame,
  y no esté yo
  ligeramente arqueada sobre mi corazón, para verlo.
  y no tenga yo que irme y dejar mi gran voz,
  y mi alto corazón
  de piedra en flor.

  I
  I am alone,
  very alone,
  between my waist and my dress,
  alone among my entire voice,
  with a charge of fragile angels
  like those caresses
  that collapse by themselves in the fingers.
  In my hair, adrift,
  a blue rower,
  confused,
  seeks a boy of sand.
  Holding his tribes of smells
  with a pale thread,
  against a silhouette of roses,
  in the quietest corner of my eyelids
  thirteen pilgrims jostle against each other.

  II
  Arching myself lightly
  over my heart of stone in bloom
  to see it,
  to tailor his arteries and my voice
  in a given moment
  in that someone comes,
  and calls me…
  but now please no one call me,
  I no longer fit in anyone’s voice,
  please no one call me,
  because I am sinking to the depths of my smallness,
  to the satisfied root of my shadow,
  because now I am descending to the agonizing
  touch of a miner, with his half flower at the shoulder,
  and a great letter of I want you at the waist.
  And I fall farther,
  into the immediacies of the air
  that lightened awaits the letters of his name
  to be born perfect and inhabitable.
  Lower,
  I descend much more,
  who will find me?
  I wear my arteries
  (what great haste I have),
  I wear my arteries and my voice,
  I don my heart of stone in bloom,
  so that in a given moment
  someone would come,
  and call for me,
  and I won’t be
  lightly arched over my heart, to see it.
  and I won’t have to go and leave my great voice,
  and my high heart
  of stone in bloom.
note: "<p>Throughout her entire <em>oeuvre</em>, Odio plays with similar themes. In
  her earlier work, Odio analyzes the relationship between the lover and the beloved.
  In later poems, Odio will go on to explore the relationship between the creator
  and the created. In Odio’s mind, creation is linked to sacred poetic language, which
  engenders a new reality. Hence, throughout her poetry, Odio includes biblical allusions,
  such as the “thirteen pilgrims.” She also plays with common epic tropes, such as
  embarking on a descending journey to bring healing and order in many poems, including
  <em>Declinaciones del monólogo</em> and <em>El tránsito de fuego: Parte II</em>.
  The erotic, as seen in <em>Declinaciones del monólogo</em>, plays a central role
  in Odio’s poetry. Through the erotic, Odio discusses the relationship between sexuality,
  the poetic body, and existential awareness. By touching upon the physical, she also
  transgresses the limits of conventional love poetry, becoming at once incredibly
  avant-garde yet also completely rooted in her humanity.</p>\n<p>In two parts of
  Declinaciones del monólogo, Odio writes of <em>calzarme,</em> be it “calzarme sus
  arterias y mi voz” or “me calzo mis arterias (y mi voz).” <em>Calzar</em> brings
  two images to my mind: fitting feet into shoes or fitting puzzle pieces together.
  In the first rendition of “calzarme sus arterias y mi voz,” the lyric “I” speaks
  of fitting disparate pieces together, of his and of mine, a combination that cannot
  last. She is also speaking of it passively, in the infinitive form. In this spirit,
  the image of tailoring these two pieces together came to me: they will synthetically
  fit on the lyric “I,” but not organically. In the second use of “me calzo mis arterias
  y mi voz,” the lyric “I” takes agency over her own veins and voice, reflected in
  the conjugated verb form. I highlight this evolution in agency by translating <em>me
  calzo</em> this time as “I wear.” Immediately below, I translate <em>me pongo</em>
  as “I don,” which is both a literal translation (albeit a rather old-fashioned one)
  and a translingual pun — in Spanish, <em>don</em> is an honorific derived from Latin
  <em>dominus</em>, master of a household. In this context, <em>don</em> places additional
  emphasis on the mastery of the lyric “I” over herself.</p>\n<p>In Spanish, you can
  express a desire in a commanding tone by using constructions like “que no me llamen.”
  In translating this forceful wish into English, I thought of it as “please no one
  call me,” highlighting the vulnerability and intensity of the lyric “I.”</p>\nThe
  most common translation of “I like you” into Spanish is <em>te quiero</em> — to
  me, it is also one of the most careless. <em>Te quiero</em> connotes “I want you”
  and “I’m fond of you.” In attempting to transmit Odio’s erotic spirit as well as
  this poem’s struggle between love and independence, I opted for the “I want you”
  variation.</p>\n<p>In all her poems, Odio plays with the different genders words
  have in Spanish. In this poem, the salient example is <i>el aire</i>, “the (masculine)
  air.” He links the human with the eternal: immediate, waiting, and about to become
  reborn. A counterpart to the lyric “I,” a masculine to her feminine. Thus, I emphasized
  the air’s masculinity in my translation (“the letters of <strong>his</strong> name”),
  subtly alluded to in the original through Odio’s purposeful use of <i>de <strong>l</strong>
  aire</i> as opposed to a possible <i>de aire</i> (deliberately including the implied
  masculine “l”), and the gendered adjectives <em>aligerad<strong>o</strong></em>
  and <em>perfect<strong>o</strong></em>.</p> "

  <p>Eunice Odio (1919–1974) detested biographies. “The affairs of my private life are the most private and, in general, no one knows them, except me.” Even so, I will attempt to provide a brief sketch of Odio’s lives — both the inner poetic life she constructed and the outer tragedy she lived — to better color her work.</p>
  <p>Octavio Paz once told Odio that she was “of that line of poets who invent their own mythology, like Blake, like St. John Perse, like Ezra Pound; and they are rubbed out, because no one understands them until years or even centuries after their death.” And as mythological Odio’s writing certainly is: she plays with language and gender and reality, often relaying her own mystical experiences in her poetry, inspired by old epics.</p>
  <p>Odio’s biography is impossible to extricate from her own personal mythology. For the longest time, scholars believed her birth year to have been 1922, perhaps due to Odio’s coquetry, until it was discovered that Odio had in fact been born in 1919. Her own death is even further shrouded in mystery: she was found ten days after her death, alone, in her bathtub in Mexico sometime in 1974; the exact date is uncertain. Suspicions as to how she died abound: suicide by venom, an accidental slip in the tub, assassination. The one certainty from Odio’s life is that she migrated from Costa Rica northward, seeking a home for her fierce individuality and expression. She never found it.</p>
tbio: "<p>Couloir X. Hanson is a daughter of three worlds: Costa Rica, Germany, and
  the United States. Her favorite authors are magical realists, like Juan Rulfo and
  Julio Cortázar and Gabriel García Márquez — authors who challenge objective reality.
  Couloir first read Eunice Odio when writing her high school thesis partially on
  Odio’s <em>Tercer poema (Consumación)</em> and has been haunted by Odio’s mythological
  poetry ever since. In her free time, Couloir enjoys picking wildflowers, playing
  chess, and singing opera. After graduating from Penn, Couloir will work in real
  estate, where she hopes to use her whimsy to see what is and imagine what could
  be.</p>"
