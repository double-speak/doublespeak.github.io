transtitle: 'Shapes in Sleep: Eight Poems'
author: Paul Celan
translator: David Ting
poem: "AUGENBLICKE, wessen Winke, \nkeine Helle schläft. \nUnentworden, allerorten,
  \nsammle dich, \nsteh. \n\n\n\nDeine Hände, die unermüdlichen Jäger. Gott \nist
  vergessen, sie greifen die Beute, du lebst. \nEine Stunde, diese, \nbläst dir den
  Namen leer. \n\n\n\nIN DIE NACHT GEGANGEN, helferisch \nein stern-\ndurchlässiges
  Blatt \nstatt des Mundes: \n\nes bleibt \nnoch etwas wild zu vertun, \nbäumlings.\n\n\n\nEin
  Dritter steht neben uns, \ner spricht unsre Sprache, \ner spricht sie besser als
  wir, \ntödlicher, rauschender, heller. \n\n\n\nKOMM, wir löffeln \nNervenzellen
  \n- die Entengrütze, multipolar, \nder leergeleuchteten Teiche — \naus den \nRauten-\ngruben.
  \n\nZehn Fasern ziehn \naus den noch erreichbaren Zentren \nHalberkennbares nach.
  \n\n\n\n\nSCHNEEPART, gebäumt, bis zuletzt, \nim Aufwind, vor \nden für immer entfensterten
  \nHütten: \n\nFlachträume schirken \nübers \ngeriffelte Eis; \n\ndie Wortschatten
  \nheraushaun, sie klaftern \nrings um den Krampen \nim Kolk.\n\n\n\n\nKleine Silbe,
  kurze Heimat, \nin der du dich eingeheimnißt verlierst, \n\nder Eine, Viele, \nder
  Nachbar \nim beseelten Kristall \nfügt dir zehn Tage Nachwahn \nzu. \n\n\n\n\nAlle
  die Schlafgestalten, kristallin, \ndie du annahmst \nim Sprachschatten, \n\nihnen
  \nführ ich mein Blut zu, \n\ndie Bildzeilen, sie \nsoll ich bergen \nin den Schlitzvenen
  \nmeiner Erkenntnis -, \n\nmeine Trauer, ich seh’s, \nläuft zu dir über.\n"
transpoem: |
  MOMENTS, filled with omens,
  never shut your eyes.
  Undecaying, from all places,
  gather yourself,
  rise.



  Your hands, these inexhaustible hunters. God
  is forgotten, they reach into the hive. You survive.
  An hour, this one,
  blesses you with the name.



  INTO THE NIGHT, a volunteer
  leaf
  shivering with starlight, gone,
  instead of the mouth:

  it remains
  something savagely wasted,
  by the saplings.



  A third being stands near us,
  he speaks our language,
  he speaks it better than we can:
  deadlier, quieter, brighter.



  COME, we are spooning out
  neurons
  — like duck porridge, multipolar,
  from the unlit pond —
  out of the
  brain-
  stem.

  Ten tendons weed out
  what is still within reach.
  Half-recognizable.




  SNOW. INSOMNIA. Branching to no end,
  in the updraft, before
  the forever window-gouged
  huts:

  spindrift of dreams
  over
  riffled ice;

  to carve words
  out of shadows, tether them
  around the pickaxe
  in the echo.




  Small syllable, brief homeland,
  secret instant where you spirit yourself —

  the One, the Many,
  the neighbor
  in animate crystal:
  they possess you, ten days, all
  nightmare.




  All the shapes in sleep, crystalline,
  transmitted to you
  by voices in the dark,

  I
  lure them with my blood,

  rows of images
  burgeon, transfuse
  through slit veins,
  into what I know —

  I mourn.
  It infects you.
note: |-
  <p>A narrative binds these eight poems. Paul Celan’s lifelong subject: the presence of evil. The transitions between these poems are as important as what each poem contains. In order: a dead thing resurrects itself; a set of hands remembers its owner; a loved one vanishes; a sinister stranger appears; a skull is opened; a worksite remains haunted; someone is possessed; the reader is acquainted with grief. Allow the other voices to emerge.</p>
  <p>I have carefully selected these poems from four of his later volumes (<em>Fadensonnen</em>, <em>Lichtzwang</em>, <em>Schneepart</em>, <em> Zeitgehöft</em>), and his uncollected work, which is rarely translated into English. His work is shot through with allusions, metaphors, distorted grammar, specialized vocabulary. His poems operate like Trojan horses. In English, I cautiously open the trapdoor.</p>
  <p><b>“Augenblicke”/“Moments”</b> — Invocation of the dead, but also of the self. The poem revolves around the word for “moments”: <em>Augen</em> +  <em>Blicke</em> (“eye” + “glances”). Celan puns on the image of an eye with <em>Winke</em> (plural), which is not a “wink” but “a sign, a hint.” <em>Augenblicke</em> to <em>Winke</em>: for English, I reimagine this as the decay from “moments” to the word “omen” hidden within. I retain the assonance of <em>schläft</em>/<em>steh</em> in “eyes”/“rise.” <em>Fadensonnen</em> (1968).</p>
  <p><b>“Deine Hände, die”/“Your hands, these”</b> — The brief moment, during the creative act, when one forgets that they are writing anything. Uncollected (1958).</p>
  <p><b>“In die Nacht gegangen”/“Into the night”</b> — Records a deportation, and the ingratitude of the new generation. Punning on “leaf” as a page, as a missing part of a family tree. The mouth left behind: Celan’s. But what is wasted? Celan’s voice, or the person missing? <em>Lichtzwang</em> (1970).</p>
  <p><b>“Ein Dritter steht neben uns”/“A third being stands near us”</b> — An uncanny presence. Is it welcome? Uncollected (circa 1957).</p>
  <p><b>“Komm”/“Come”</b> — An autopsy. A telepathic excavation of the last experiences of the dead. Ten fingers dredging fibrous neurons out of a skull. <em>Rauten-</em>/<em>grüben</em> is the rhomboid fossa, a specific structure deep in the brainstem. <em>Raute</em> also refers to a bitter herb called rue, or ruewort. During the Renaissance it was believed to improve eyesight when consumed. See <em>Paradise Lost</em> (11.413–428) where the Archangel Michael “purged with euphrasy and rue / The visual nerve” of Adam; this divine concoction opens Adam’s eyes to the depths of his Original Sin, thoroughly clarifying his vision, “even to the inmost seat of mental sight.” <em>Fadensonnen</em> (1968).</p>
  <p><b>“Schneepart”/“Snow. Insomnia.”</b> — Another excavation: recapturing a forgotten dream. Strain of locating the words for it, after awakening. <em>Schneepart</em> (1971).</p>
  <ul>
  <li><em>Schnee</em> + <em>Part</em>: Not a portion or piece, this “Snowpart,” but how one plays a part, a role — plays dead. <em>Schnee</em>, snow, white, resembles the whitest, purest crematorium ash.</li>
  <li><em>gebäumt</em>: in a shape like a tree, the snowfall, falling ash: a family tree. In front of huts with broken windows. Houses with damaged eyes. Again, the scene of a deportation.</li>
  <li>“Snow. Insomnia.” to capture the mood. But I also pay homage to Osip Mandelstam’s “Schlaflosigkeit. Homer.” after Celan’s own German translation of his favorite poet. Nadezhda Mandelstam, Osip’s widow, upon reading Celan’s translations, indicated in a postcard to Celan dated July 12, 1962, that Celan had not performed this literally but had movingly transposed her husband’s Russian. In that faith, I transform Celan back into Mandelstam.</li>
  <li><em>Flachtraume schirken</em>=“flat-dreams” skipping like stones over frozen water. My translation is a different moment. “Spindrift”: the trace of debris in the wind such skipping leaves behind.</li>
  <li><em>heraushauen</em>: a verb for gathering firewood. The implication: words can be set alight.</li>
  <li><em>Kolk</em>: a bog pond, but also a vortex. A synonym for <em>Kolk </em>(“bog pond”) is <em>Moorauge</em>: “moor” + “eye.” A complement to the shattered “eyes” of the huts. Abstracting all of these resonances, this version keeps a pronunciation: the long “o” sound found in both <em>Kolk</em> and <em>echo</em>. An “o”: a shape whose circle suggests an open mouth, as well as an open eye.</li></ul>
  <p><b>“Kleine Silbe”/“Small syllable”</b> — What it can be like to read Celan: intense reflection on a single word, as if it were a crystal. The neologism <em>Nachwahn</em> (“ensuing madness”) shares the prefix <em>Nach-</em> (“to,” “after”) with <em>Nachbar</em> (“neighbor”). I keep the alliteration. Close to <em>Nachwahn</em> is <em>Nachwahl</em>: a postponed election. Uncollected (1969).</p>
  <p><b>“Alle die Schlafgestalten, kristallin”/“All the shapes in sleep, crystalline”</b> — Psychic intervention, or revenge. A translingual rhyme between lure and <em>führ</em>, root verb for Hitler’s title, <em>der Führer</em> (“the Leader”). I readjust <em>bergen</em> (“to rescue”) to “burgeon” (“to flourish”), as a play on their deceptive similarities in spelling, pronunciation, and meaning. In light of Celan’s lifelong guilt, and his eventual suicide in the knowledge that he had survived while his parents were murdered in the Holocaust: a person rescued does not necessarily flourish. <em>Zeitgehöft</em> (1975).</p>
abio: |-
  <p>The multilingual prodigy Paul Celan (1920–1970) was a poet, translator, and teacher. His poems, intimately personal yet also intimidatingly specific,  memorialize the Shoah. Until the end of his life, he lived in Paris, working at the École Normale Supérieure as a lecturer in German — a position he nearly refused because he felt it beneath him. However, assigning students translation exercises was a source of pleasure for him. His own vast translation résumé included Giuseppe Ungaretti, Henri Michaux, Marianne Moore, Fernando Pessoa, and others. He considered his translations of Osip Mandelstam as important as his own poetry. Paul Celan often strayed from literalism, enhancing lines with insertions, omissions, and autobiographical touches. Reworking Emily Dickinson, Celan approaches the last line of her stanza,</p>
  <pre>
           Let down the bars, O Death!
           The tired flocks come in
           Whose bleating ceases to repeat,
           Whose wandering is done.
  </pre>
  <p>and alters it to, “Wer nicht mehr wandert, kommt.” (“Who wanders no more, comes.”)</p>
  <p>The sly addition of <em>kommt</em> (“comes”) is quite the creative betrayal. Here we behold the deadly playfulness of Celan’s imagination, and also, how he expects to be translated. I will not speak of his death. But let the reader imagine what this one word, <em>kommt</em>, could have meant in his life.</p>
tbio: "<p>David F. Ting works for a renowned lung cancer specialist as a medical scribe.
  He is eager to get into medical school when the time is right. He is a proud alum
  of both Penn and Princeton. He occasionally wonders how a translation can survive
  on its own, if annotations must travel with it like overweight luggage. At the time
  of this writing, he is about to fly across the country. He is flying alone, he has
  a good mask, and he is probably thinking about egg tarts.</p>"
