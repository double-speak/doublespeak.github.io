poem: "AUGENBLICKE, wessen Winke, \r\nkeine Helle schläft. \r\nUnentworden, allerorten,
  \r\nsammle dich, \r\nsteh. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeine Hände, die unermüdlichen Jäger.
  Gott \r\nist vergessen, sie greifen die Beute, du lebst. \r\nEine Stunde, diese,
  \r\nbläst dir den Namen leer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN DIE NACHT GEGANGEN, helferisch
  \r\nein stern-\r\ndurchlässiges Blatt \r\nstatt des Mundes: \r\n\r\nes bleibt \r\nnoch
  etwas wild zu vertun, \r\nbäumlings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEin Dritter steht neben uns,
  \r\ner spricht unsre Sprache, \r\ner spricht sie besser als wir, \r\ntödlicher,
  rauschender, heller. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKOMM, wir löffeln \r\nNervenzellen \r\n- die
  Entengrütze, multipolar, \r\nder leergeleuchteten Teiche — \r\naus den \r\nRauten-\r\ngruben.
  \r\n\r\nZehn Fasern ziehn \r\naus den noch erreichbaren Zentren \r\nHalberkennbares
  nach. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHNEEPART, gebäumt, bis zuletzt, \r\nim Aufwind, vor
  \r\nden für immer entfensterten \r\nHütten: \r\n\r\nFlachträume schirken \r\nübers
  \r\ngeriffelte Eis; \r\n\r\ndie Wortschatten \r\nheraushaun, sie klaftern \r\nrings
  um den Krampen \r\nim Kolk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKleine Silbe, kurze Heimat, \r\nin
  der du dich eingeheimnißt verlierst, \r\n\r\nder Eine, Viele, \r\nder Nachbar \r\nim
  beseelten Kristall \r\nfügt dir zehn Tage Nachwahn \r\nzu. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlle
  die Schlafgestalten, kristallin, \r\ndie du annahmst \r\nim Sprachschatten, \r\n\r\nihnen
  \r\nführ ich mein Blut zu, \r\n\r\ndie Bildzeilen, sie \r\nsoll ich bergen \r\nin
  den Schlitzvenen \r\nmeiner Erkenntnis -, \r\n\r\nmeine Trauer, ich seh’s, \r\nläuft
  zu dir über.\r\n"
transpoem: "MOMENTS, filled with omens,\r\nnever shut your eyes.\r\nUndecaying, from
  all places,\r\ngather yourself,\r\nrise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour hands, these inexhaustible
  hunters. God\r\nis forgotten, they reach into the hive. You survive.\r\nAn hour,
  this one,\r\nblesses you with the name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTO THE NIGHT, a volunteer\r\nleaf\r\nshivering
  with starlight, gone,\r\ninstead of the mouth:\r\n\r\nit remains\r\nsomething savagely
  wasted,\r\nby the saplings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA third being stands near us,\r\nhe speaks
  our language,\r\nhe speaks it better than we can:\r\ndeadlier, quieter, brighter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOME,
  we are spooning out\r\nneurons\r\n— like duck porridge, multipolar,\r\nfrom the
  unlit pond —\r\nout of the\r\nbrain-\r\nstem.\r\n\r\nTen tendons weed out\r\nwhat
  is still within reach.\r\nHalf-recognizable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOW. INSOMNIA.
  Branching to no end,\r\nin the updraft, before\r\nthe forever window-gouged\r\nhuts:\r\n\r\nspindrift
  of dreams\r\nover\r\nriffled ice;\r\n\r\nto carve words\r\nout of shadows, tether
  them\r\naround the pickaxe\r\nin the echo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall syllable, brief
  homeland,\r\nsecret instant where you spirit yourself —\r\n\r\nthe One, the Many,\r\nthe
  neighbor\r\nin animate crystal:\r\nthey possess you, ten days, all\r\nnightmare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll
  the shapes in sleep, crystalline,\r\ntransmitted to you\r\nby voices in the dark,\r\n\r\nI\r\nlure
  them with my blood,\r\n\r\nrows of images\r\nburgeon, transfuse\r\nthrough slit
  veins,\r\ninto what I know —\r\n\r\nI mourn.\r\nIt infects you.\r\n"
note: "<p>A narrative binds these eight poems. Paul Celan’s lifelong subject: the
  presence of evil. The transitions between these poems are as important as what each
  poem contains. In order: a dead thing resurrects itself; a set of hands remembers
  its owner; a loved one vanishes; a sinister stranger appears; a skull is opened;
  a worksite remains haunted; someone is possessed; the reader is acquainted with
  grief. Allow the other voices to emerge.</p>\r\n<p>I have carefully selected these
  poems from four of his later volumes (<em>Fadensonnen</em>, <em>Lichtzwang</em>,
  <em>Schneepart</em>, <em> Zeitgehöft</em>), and his uncollected work, which is rarely
  translated into English. His work is shot through with allusions, metaphors, distorted
  grammar, specialized vocabulary. His poems operate like Trojan horses. In English,
  I cautiously open the trapdoor.</p>\r\n<p><b>“Augenblicke”/“Moments”</b> — Invocation
  of the dead, but also of the self. The poem revolves around the word for “moments”:
  <em>Augen</em> +  <em>Blicke</em> (“eye” + “glances”). Celan puns on the image of
  an eye with <em>Winke</em> (plural), which is not a “wink” but “a sign, a hint.”
  <em>Augenblicke</em> to <em>Winke</em>: for English, I reimagine this as the decay
  from “moments” to the word “omen” hidden within. I retain the assonance of <em>schläft</em>/<em>steh</em>
  in “eyes”/“rise.” <em>Fadensonnen</em> (1968).</p>\r\n<p><b>“Deine Hände, die”/“Your
  hands, these”</b> — The brief moment, during the creative act, when one forgets
  that they are writing anything. Uncollected (1958).</p>\r\n<p><b>“In die Nacht gegangen”/“Into
  the night”</b> — Records a deportation, and the ingratitude of the new generation.
  Punning on “leaf” as a page, as a missing part of a family tree. The mouth left
  behind: Celan’s. But what is wasted? Celan’s voice, or the person missing? <em>Lichtzwang</em>
  (1970).</p>\r\n<p><b>“Ein Dritter steht neben uns”/“A third being stands near us”</b>
  — An uncanny presence. Is it welcome? Uncollected (circa 1957).</p>\r\n<p><b>“Komm”/“Come”</b>
  — An autopsy. A telepathic excavation of the last experiences of the dead. Ten fingers
  dredging fibrous neurons out of a skull. <em>Rauten-</em>/<em>grüben</em> is the
  rhomboid fossa, a specific structure deep in the brainstem. <em>Raute</em> also
  refers to a bitter herb called rue, or ruewort. During the Renaissance it was believed
  to improve eyesight when consumed. See <em>Paradise Lost</em> (11.413–428) where
  the Archangel Michael “purged with euphrasy and rue / The visual nerve” of Adam;
  this divine concoction opens Adam’s eyes to the depths of his Original Sin, thoroughly
  clarifying his vision, “even to the inmost seat of mental sight.” <em>Fadensonnen</em>
  (1968).</p>\r\n<p><b>“Schneepart”/“Snow. Insomnia.”</b> — Another excavation: recapturing
  a forgotten dream. Strain of locating the words for it, after awakening. <em>Schneepart</em>
  (1971).</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Schnee</em> + <em>Part</em>: Not a portion or piece,
  this “Snowpart,” but how one plays a part, a role — plays dead. <em>Schnee</em>,
  snow, white, resembles the whitest, purest crematorium ash.</li>\r\n<li><em>gebäumt</em>:
  in a shape like a tree, the snowfall, falling ash: a family tree. In front of huts
  with broken windows. Houses with damaged eyes. Again, the scene of a deportation.</li>\r\n<li>“Snow.
  Insomnia.” to capture the mood. But I also pay homage to Osip Mandelstam’s “Schlaflosigkeit.
  Homer.” after Celan’s own German translation of his favorite poet. Nadezhda Mandelstam,
  Osip’s widow, upon reading Celan’s translations, indicated in a postcard to Celan
  dated July 12, 1962, that Celan had not performed this literally but had movingly
  transposed her husband’s Russian. In that faith, I transform Celan back into Mandelstam.</li>\r\n<li><em>Flachtraume
  schirken</em>=“flat-dreams” skipping like stones over frozen water. My translation
  is a different moment. “Spindrift”: the trace of debris in the wind such skipping
  leaves behind.</li>\r\n<li><em>heraushauen</em>: a verb for gathering firewood.
  The implication: words can be set alight.</li>\r\n<li><em>Kolk</em>: a bog pond,
  but also a vortex. A synonym for <em>Kolk </em>(“bog pond”) is <em>Moorauge</em>:
  “moor” + “eye.” A complement to the shattered “eyes” of the huts. Abstracting all
  of these resonances, this version keeps a pronunciation: the long “o” sound found
  in both <em>Kolk</em> and <em>echo</em>. An “o”: a shape whose circle suggests an
  open mouth, as well as an open eye.</li></ul>\r\n<p><b>“Kleine Silbe”/“Small syllable”</b>
  — What it can be like to read Celan: intense reflection on a single word, as if
  it were a crystal. The neologism <em>Nachwahn</em> (“ensuing madness”) shares the
  prefix <em>Nach-</em> (“to,” “after”) with <em>Nachbar</em> (“neighbor”). I keep
  the alliteration. Close to <em>Nachwahn</em> is <em>Nachwahl</em>: a postponed election.
  Uncollected (1969).</p>\r\n<p><b>“Alle die Schlafgestalten, kristallin”/“All the
  shapes in sleep, crystalline”</b> — Psychic intervention, or revenge. A translingual
  rhyme between lure and <em>führ</em>, root verb for Hitler’s title, <em>der Führer</em>
  (“the Leader”). I readjust <em>bergen</em> (“to rescue”) to “burgeon” (“to flourish”),
  as a play on their deceptive similarities in spelling, pronunciation, and meaning.
  In light of Celan’s lifelong guilt, and his eventual suicide in the knowledge that
  he had survived while his parents were murdered in the Holocaust: a person rescued
  does not necessarily flourish. <em>Zeitgehöft</em> (1975).</p>"
abio: "<p>The multilingual prodigy Paul Celan (1920–1970) was a poet, translator,
  and teacher. His poems, intimately personal yet also intimidatingly specific,  memorialize
  the Shoah. Until the end of his life, he lived in Paris, working at the École Normale
  Supérieure as a lecturer in German — a position he nearly refused because he felt
  it beneath him. However, assigning students translation exercises was a source of
  pleasure for him. His own vast translation résumé included Giuseppe Ungaretti, Henri
  Michaux, Marianne Moore, Fernando Pessoa, and others. He considered his translations
  of Osip Mandelstam as important as his own poetry. Paul Celan often strayed from
  literalism, enhancing lines with insertions, omissions, and autobiographical touches.
  Reworking Emily Dickinson, Celan approaches the last line of her stanza,</p>\r\n<pre>\r\n
  \        Let down the bars, O Death!\r\n         The tired flocks come in\r\n         Whose
  bleating ceases to repeat,\r\n         Whose wandering is done.\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>and
  alters it to, “Wer nicht mehr wandert, kommt.” (“Who wanders no more, comes.”)</p>\r\n<p>The
  sly addition of <em>kommt</em> (“comes”) is quite the creative betrayal. Here we
  behold the deadly playfulness of Celan’s imagination, and also, how he expects to
  be translated. I will not speak of his death. But let the reader imagine what this
  one word, <em>kommt</em>, could have meant in his life.</p>"
tbio: "<p>David F. Ting works for a renowned lung cancer specialist as a medical scribe.
  He is eager to get into medical school when the time is right. He is a proud alum
  of both Penn and Princeton. He occasionally wonders how a translation can survive
  on its own, if annotations must travel with it like overweight luggage. At the time
  of this writing, he is about to fly across the country. He is flying alone, he has
  a good mask, and he is probably thinking about egg tarts.</p>"
