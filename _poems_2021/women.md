poem: "<i>A toute mes soeurs \nqui souffrent loin de moi</i>\n\nFemmes africaines
  !\nFemmes de savanes et de la steppe ! \nFemmes des régions libérées ! \nFemmes
  de la Guinée Bissau, femmes d’Afrique ! \n\nVous avez aimé devant la rougeur de
  feux, \nSous le silence de l’ennemi, \nVous avez donné vie sous les crépitements
  \ndes mitrailleuses\nVous les sœurs opprimées, vous qui gardez \ndans vos entailles
  \nLe visage de l’Afrique immortelle ! \nVous ne pourrez être oubliées, ni décolorées.
  \n\nVous avez nourri l’Afrique de votre sève\nVotre peau d’ébène a refusé la caresse
  du colonisateur. \n\nFemmes africaines ! \nBelles femmes à la peau sombre\nAcceptez
  la demande de votre sœur du Sénégal. \n\nBelles femmes noires \nAux destinées éternelles,
  \nEnrôle dans vos brigades\nJe mettrai l’uniforme du refus, \nJe participerai à
  vos simulacres\nDe combat, et je crierai : \n\nVIVE L’AFRIQUE LIBRE ! "
transpoem: "<i>To all my sisters who suffer far from me</i>\n\nWomen of Africa! \nWomen
  of the Savanah and the Plain! \nWomen of the liberated regions! \nWomen of the Guinea-Bissau,
  women of Africa! \n\nYou have loved before the blush of fire, \nUnder the silence
  of the enemy, \nYou have given life under \nthe sputter of machine guns, \nYou the
  sisters oppressed, \nyou who guard in your womb, \nThe face of the immortal Africa!
  \nYou will not be neither forgotten, nor left to fade. \n\nYou have fed Africa from
  your lifeblood\nYour skin of ebony refuses the caress of the colonizer. \n\nWomen
  of Africa! \nBeautiful women with dark skin \nAccept the request of your sister
  from Senegal. \n\nBeautiful black women \nTo your enteral destinies, \nEnlist in
  your brigades\nI will put on the uniform of refusal, \nI will participate in your
  mockery\nOf combat, and I will cry: \n\nLONG LIVE THE LIBERATED AFRICA! "

  <p>Of the few poems I’ve translated in my life, this was definitely the most challenging. Ndiaye utilizes a lot of great imagery throughout the poem related to being the nurse or caretaker of someone that was difficult to translate directly. For example, <em>de couver</em> in the line “de couver mon sommeil éternel” translates most directly to “to wrap a child in cotton wool.” I tried to preserve this notion through the use of the word “swathe,” which similarly refers to the idea of wrapping a baby in fabric. I also struggled with the line “to care not to hide.” This translation originally did not make much sense to me within the context of the poem, so I tried many different versions and arrangements. However, I continued to come back to this most direct translation of Ndiaye’s words. I feel like it allows the most room for interpretation of her meaning without my own personal inputs. I maintain her punctuation, line breaks, and structure throughout the entire poem, along with the repetition of “When I Die.”</p>
  <p>Three years ago, I translated the poem “Femme Noir” by Léopold Senghor for the 2018 edition of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>. When I found this poem by Ndiaye, I felt that it was a near perfect follow-up to my first translation, as it offers both a call to arms and love for Black women (specifically those from Africa) from the perspective of a Black woman. I tried my best to maintain the high-energy and fast-paced nature of the poem in my translation by keeping the lines to a similar length and retaining the same punctuation and structure. I also chose to translate all of the lines starting with <em>femme</em> as “Women of” to add repetition to the poem to keep it moving forward. I also tried to as closely as possible preserve the meanings of the more descriptive words like <em>crépitements</em>, which directly translates to “the crackling of machine guns.” However, I chose to use the word “sputter” in my translation because I felt it more accurately captured in English the sound she was trying to evoke. Similarly, while <em>ni decolorées</em> literally translates to “neither faded,” the line was difficult to translate as there is no meaningful English equivalent to this use of the past tense. I opted to use the phrase “left to fade,” as I believe it more accurately captures the feeling of the original line. Finally, I sifted through several different English translation of the line: “VIVE L’AFRIQUE LIBRE” (“long live free Africa,” “God bless free Africa,” etc.), but ultimate settled on translating <em>libre</em> as “liberated” as it felt like it carried the most nuanced understanding of what it means for Africa and Black women to be free.</p>
