transtitle: Some Later Day
author: Kim Sowol
translator: Younghoon Jeong and Saagar Asnani
poem: |-
  먼 훗날 당신이 찾으시면
  그때에 내 말이 잊었노라.

  당신이 속으로 나무라면
  무척 그리다가 잊었노라.

  그래도 당신이 나무라면
  믿기지 않아서 잊었노라.

  오늘도 어제도 아니 잊고
  먼 훗날 그때에 잊었노라.
transpoem: |-
  If in the distant future you seek me,
  Then at that time, I will say, “I forgot.”

  If you do blame me silently within,
  “Having truly longed for you, I forgot.”

  If you would still insist on blaming me,
  “Since I could not accept it, I forgot.”

  I, neither today nor the day before,
  But on that distant future day, forgot.

  Approaching Kim Sowol’s poetry was a uniquely challenging task because of its ties to Korean folk songs, its economical use of language, and its tight metrical structure. Though it is composed of but eight short lines, Kim takes the reader on a journey of heartbreak, inner conflict, and eventual catharsis through the poem. While translating, we wanted to preserve three key elements of the original: the decasyllabic metrical structure, the alternating end repetition of the conditional tense with the word “forgot” (<span lang= "ko">잊었노라</span>), and the facile movement between narration and direct speech. We hoped to bring out his nuanced emotions in English without obfuscating the beautiful Korean words from which they arose.</p>
  <p>While translating, one difficulty that came up was the translation of the title. <span lang= "ko">먼 후일</span> (derived from the Chinese character <span lang= "zh">後日</span>) is an idiomatic expression that differs from the commonly used Korean word for future, <span lang= "ko">미래</span>, in that it indicates a far-off day, a day that comes later, or one that will never come to pass. Though our initial instinct was to translate it as “future day,” that would have effaced its semantic clarity through the idiom, so we chose to use “Some later day”: one which may or may not ever occur. Kim also uses the word <span lang= "ko">흣날</span> in the body of the poem, which is very close to <span lang= "ko">후일</span>, but with a greater emphasis on time elapsed. Since a literal translation could easily become very wordy here (e.g. “on a far off day that is yet to come”), we instead chose the phrase “distant future” to stand in for the multiplicity of <span lang= "ko">흣날</span>.</p>
  <p>We would also like to thank our good friend, Jennifer Ye Ji Cho, for her insightful feedback and nuanced comments on how to capture the poetic Korean in English.</p>
abio: '<p>Born in 1902 in Kwaksan, North Pyong’an Province (located in present-day
  North Korea), Kim Sowol (<span lang= "ko" style="font-style: normal">김소월</span>)
  is one of Korea’s most treasured poets. Through his writings during the Japanese
  colonial period, he revived the spirit of Korean folk traditions. He lived a short,
  but prolific, life in which he published poetry that encapsulates the spirit of
  Korean folk songs; its rhythm, pitch, and meter lead to a blurring between language
  and song. This makes translating Kim Sowol’s poetry particularly difficult, due
  to the culture-specific references and its ties to Korean folk music. His magnum
  opus, <em>Azalea</em> (<span lang= "ko"><em>진달래 꽃</em></span>), poignantly captures
  the speech of a woman to her soon-to-be separated lover. His poetry was also famous
  for employing the concept of “<span lang= "ko">반어법</span>,” or “opposite practice,”
  in which he wrote the opposite of what he meant to convey. Some translators work
  around this by providing multiple versions of the translation, each capturing a
  specific mood or aspect of the original. Kim passed away in 1934 from a suspected
  opium overdose, although the exact cause of and motive for his death have never
  been determined; some speculate it was suicide, others a simple miscalculation of
  his daily painkillers. What we do know is that he left behind a body of poetry that
  we can appreciate for its frankness and clever manipulation of linguistic and musical
  elements. He left behind poetry that conveys heartfelt sentiments.</p>'

He loves to code, and often finds himself doing so at midnight while enjoying lo-fi music. Younghoon received his BA as a double major in Chinese culture and computer science. While studying abroad at Tsinghua University (Beijing, China), he realized that he loves interacting with people of varying cultural backgrounds; this has been a huge inspiration for him to take on learning foreign languages like English and Mandarin Chinese, as well as travel across the world (before COVID-19). In his free time, Younghoon likes to rap, play badminton, and drink <em>pu’er</em> tea.</p>
  <p>Saagar Asnani (C’19) is a PhD student in musicology at the University of California, Berkeley. A medievalist, linguist, and poetry enthusiast, Saagar is fascinated by how music and language overlap, interact, and work together in myriad ways within our world. A scholar of medieval French musical genres, he believes that by studying the soundscapes of the past we can learn more about the structures and dynamics of human communication and perception today. He has been learning Korean for the past five years, and this is his first foray into translating Korean poetry to English. His research on medieval music has also immersed him in Latin and Middle French. As a graduating senior at Penn in 2019, he was awarded the Clifton C. Cherpack Prize in French Studies. In his free time, Saagar enjoys playing viola and is an active member of UC Berkeley’s Symphony Orchestra.</p>
