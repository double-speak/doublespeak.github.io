  Chain Verse \r\n\r\nOutside, enjoying the flowers, then coming back\r\non a horse,
  running, running, almost flying.\r\nThe sprightly horse seems like it’s flying;\r\nthe
  impact of the wine \r\nis fading. My drunken\r\nfog is clearing; \r\nthe hour \r\nis
  already \r\nlate.\r\nWhen\r\n I woke, \r\nit was already dusk,\r\nand I’ve come
  back from enjoying the flowers. \r\n"
note: <p>The original poem, an example of chain verses (<span lang= "zh">连环诗</span>)
  in ancient Chinese, is only fourteen characters long. This form of verse (<span
  lang= "zh">七言绝句</span>) is often twenty-eight characters long, with each line having
  seven characters. In this chain verse, the last three or four characters of each
  line are repeated in the next line, so the resulting poem requires only fourteen
  distinct characters. One fascinating feature of this poem is that in each line,
  the repeated characters often change parts of speech, slightly altering the meaning.
  For example, in the line “the impact of the wine is fading,” the original word for
  “fading” means “becoming slight” (<span lang= "zh">微</span>), and in the next line,
  this word becomes an adverb (here translated as "slightly”) that modifies the verb
  “waking” (<span lang= "zh">醒</span>), which we’ve translated in this context as
  “clearing.” For the shape, we couldn’t get it to form a diamond as in the original
  due to the wordiness of English, so we formed it into an ancient Chinese wine goblet
  (<span lang= "zh">觚</span>, <em>gu</em>), hoping to convey some of the meaning of
  the poem through the form.</p>
abio: <p>The author is alleged to be <span lang= "zh">苏轼</span>, Su Shi, but this
  remains unconfirmed. Su Shi was a Chinese calligrapher, essayist, gastronomer, pharmacologist,
  poet, politician, and travel writer during the Song dynasty.</p>
tbio: "<p>Gil Lehmann and Jacey Chang are both Masters of City Planning students in
  the Weitzman School of Design. Yehudith Dashevsky is a former <em>DoubleSpeak</em>
  editor who currently works in Washington, DC.</p>"
