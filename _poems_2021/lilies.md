translator: Emma Arsekin
poem: |
  U polju i u gori bijeli krinovi procvali

  Po polju i gori krin kao da nešto zbori
  Po gori i dolu svaki krin
  Kao da gori

  I kada tiho između procvalih cvjetova
  Zamišljen tako
  Prolaziš

  Možda kao i ja pomisliš na one koji su
  Prije tebe ovuda tiho
  Prolazili

  Između procvalih bijelih cvjetova

  Pitajući se isto tako kao i ti
  Šta li su ovi bijeli
  Krinovi

  Da li su to nečiji klikovi
  Ili
  Krikovi

  Znaci onih koji su nekada prolazili
  I u bespućima ovim
  Beznadno
  Gazili

  U potrazi za bijelim cvijećem

  (1966)
transpoem: |
  In the field and in the forest, white lilies bloom

  Across the field and forest, it is as if the lily is saying something
  Across the mountain and valley each lily
  Is as if it is burning

  And when quietly between blossoming flowers
  So deep in thought
  You pass

  Maybe like me you think of those who
  Here before you quietly
  Passed

  Between blossoming white flowers

  Wondering just like you
  What are these white
  Lilies

  Are they someone’s clicks
  Or
  Shrieks

  Signs of those who once passed
  And in these wastelands
  Hopelessly
  Treaded

  In search of white flowers

  (1966)

  <p>The biggest hurdle in translating “Krinovi” was maintaining Dizdar’s pensive tone and relationship to time, which play starring roles in such a short, unadorned piece. “Krinovi” is from the larger work <em>Kameni Spavač</em> (<em>Stone Sleeper</em>) (1966), inspired by Bosnia’s <em>stećci</em> — monumental medieval tombstones. <em>Kameni Spavač</em> explores Bosnia’s rich, unique history from the perspective of Eastern Europe’s post-World War II identity-forming period, and “Krinovi” in particular makes this history come alive. Dizdar does not veil his symbolism: <em>stećci</em> are traditionally carved from white stone and dot the landscape like flowers, and the Bosnian lily (<em>Lilium bosniacum</em>, featured on the medieval Bosnian coat of arms) is one of Bosnia’s most recognizable national symbols.</p>
  <p>With this context in mind, “Krinovi” — or “Lilies” — becomes the story of a nation caught between past and present. Capturing this sense of haunting timelessness in an English translation proved to be challenging, and I made some stylistic choices to try to preserve this atmosphere at the expense of fidelity to literal meanings. In particular, many of the verbs used in the original text are in present- or past-continuous tense, but were translated in simple tenses to preserve Dizdar’s minimalist style and uninterrupted flow. For example, it would be more accurate to translate <em>prolazili</em> as “(they) were passing” than as “(they) passed,” but I worried that using this translation would sound clunky and obscure the central role of the past in the poem. Other verbs are more nuanced. For example, in the first line, I translated <em>procvali</em> as “bloom”; in context, however, this word feels like a strange blend of past and present tense, and might best translate to something like “are bloomed.” In a poem that deals so heavily with living history, this verb choice works wonders in Bosnian, but it is difficult to recreate the effect in translation.</p>

  <p>Mehmedalija “Mak” Dizdar (1917–1971) was born in southern Bosnia to a Muslim Bosniak family. At nineteen, he relocated to Sarajevo, where he graduated from gymnasium and spent his years during World War II. His mother and sister were killed in the Jasenovac concentration camp. Dizdar became a devout supporter of the Communist Yugoslav Partisans and served as the editor-in-chief of <em>Oslobođenje</em>, a renowned Bosnian daily newspaper founded as an anti-Nazi publication. He later became the President of the Writers’ Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he served until his death.</p>
  <p>Despite his political alignment, Dizdar’s poetry drew primarily from pre-Ottoman Bosnian Christianity, Islamic mysticism, and the cultural remains of medieval Bosnia. He was heavily inspired by inscriptions on medieval Bosnian tombstones (<em>stećci</em>), which are prominent religious and cultural symbols in his poetry. Dizdar used a medieval vantage point in his most influential work, allowing him to contemplate themes such as death, the experience of the world, homeland, the afterlife, and placement within history. His works, <em>Kameni Spavač</em> (<em>Stone Sleeper</em>) and <em>Modra Rijeka</em> (<em>Blue River</em>), are considered among the most important Bosnian poetic achievements of the twentieth century.</p>
tbio: "<p>Emma Arsekin is an undergraduate studying history and political science
  at the University of Pennsylvania, with minors in East Central European studies
  and international relations. She is the daughter of Bosnian refugees who fled the
  Yugoslav Wars in the mid-1990s. Deeply influenced by her experience growing up in
  a Bosnian diaspora community, she is eager to uncover elements of Bosnian culture
  that were obscured by a childhood spent assimilating. She is an avid rock climber,
  traveler, and language-learner.</p>"
