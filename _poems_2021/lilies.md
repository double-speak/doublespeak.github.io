translator: Emma Arsekin
poem: "U polju i u gori bijeli krinovi procvali\r\n\r\nPo polju i gori krin kao da
  nešto zbori\r\nPo gori i dolu svaki krin\r\nKao da gori\r\n\r\nI kada tiho između
  procvalih cvjetova\r\nZamišljen tako\r\nProlaziš\r\n\r\nMožda kao i ja pomisliš
  na one koji su\r\nPrije tebe ovuda tiho\r\nProlazili\r\n\r\nIzmeđu procvalih bijelih
  cvjetova\r\n\r\nPitajući se isto tako kao i ti\r\nŠta li su ovi bijeli\r\nKrinovi\r\n\r\nDa
  li su to nečiji klikovi\r\nIli\r\nKrikovi\r\n\r\nZnaci onih koji su nekada prolazili\r\nI
  u bespućima ovim\r\nBeznadno\r\nGazili\r\n\r\nU potrazi za bijelim cvijećem\r\n\r\n(1966)\r\n"
transpoem: "In the field and in the forest, white lilies bloom\r\n\r\nAcross the field
  and forest, it is as if the lily is saying something\r\nAcross the mountain and
  valley each lily\r\nIs as if it is burning\r\n\r\nAnd when quietly between blossoming
  flowers\r\nSo deep in thought\r\nYou pass\r\n\r\nMaybe like me you think of those
  who\r\nHere before you quietly\r\nPassed\r\n\r\nBetween blossoming white flowers\r\n\r\nWondering
  just like you\r\nWhat are these white\r\nLilies\r\n\r\nAre they someone’s clicks\r\nOr\r\nShrieks\r\n\r\nSigns
  of those who once passed\r\nAnd in these wastelands\r\nHopelessly\r\nTreaded\r\n\r\nIn
  search of white flowers\r\n\r\n(1966)\r\n"
note: "<p>The biggest hurdle in translating “Krinovi” was maintaining Dizdar’s pensive
  tone and relationship to time, which play starring roles in such a short, unadorned
  piece. “Krinovi” is from the larger work <em>Kameni Spavač</em> (<em>Stone Sleeper</em>)
  (1966), inspired by Bosnia’s <em>stećci</em> — monumental medieval tombstones. <em>Kameni
  Spavač</em> explores Bosnia’s rich, unique history from the perspective of Eastern
  Europe’s post-World War II identity-forming period, and “Krinovi” in particular
  makes this history come alive. Dizdar does not veil his symbolism: <em>stećci</em>
  are traditionally carved from white stone and dot the landscape like flowers, and
  the Bosnian lily (<em>Lilium bosniacum</em>, featured on the medieval Bosnian coat
  of arms) is one of Bosnia’s most recognizable national symbols.</p>\r\n<p>With this
  context in mind, “Krinovi” — or “Lilies” — becomes the story of a nation caught
  between past and present. Capturing this sense of haunting timelessness in an English
  translation proved to be challenging, and I made some stylistic choices to try to
  preserve this atmosphere at the expense of fidelity to literal meanings. In particular,
  many of the verbs used in the original text are in present- or past-continuous tense,
  but were translated in simple tenses to preserve Dizdar’s minimalist style and uninterrupted
  flow. For example, it would be more accurate to translate <em>prolazili</em> as
  “(they) were passing” than as “(they) passed,” but I worried that using this translation
  would sound clunky and obscure the central role of the past in the poem. Other verbs
  are more nuanced. For example, in the first line, I translated <em>procvali</em>
  as “bloom”; in context, however, this word feels like a strange blend of past and
  present tense, and might best translate to something like “are bloomed.” In a poem
  that deals so heavily with living history, this verb choice works wonders in Bosnian,
  but it is difficult to recreate the effect in translation.</p>"
abio: "<p>Mehmedalija “Mak” Dizdar (1917–1971) was born in southern Bosnia to a Muslim
  Bosniak family. At nineteen, he relocated to Sarajevo, where he graduated from gymnasium
  and spent his years during World War II. His mother and sister were killed in the
  Jasenovac concentration camp. Dizdar became a devout supporter of the Communist
  Yugoslav Partisans and served as the editor-in-chief of <em>Oslobođenje</em>, a
  renowned Bosnian daily newspaper founded as an anti-Nazi publication. He later became
  the President of the Writers’ Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he served until
  his death.</p>\r\n<p>Despite his political alignment, Dizdar’s poetry drew primarily
  from pre-Ottoman Bosnian Christianity, Islamic mysticism, and the cultural remains
  of medieval Bosnia. He was heavily inspired by inscriptions on medieval Bosnian
  tombstones (<em>stećci</em>), which are prominent religious and cultural symbols
  in his poetry. Dizdar used a medieval vantage point in his most influential work,
  allowing him to contemplate themes such as death, the experience of the world, homeland,
  the afterlife, and placement within history. His works, <em>Kameni Spavač</em> (<em>Stone
  Sleeper</em>) and <em>Modra Rijeka</em> (<em>Blue River</em>), are considered among
  the most important Bosnian poetic achievements of the twentieth century.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Emma Arsekin is an undergraduate studying history and political science
  at the University of Pennsylvania, with minors in East Central European studies
  and international relations. She is the daughter of Bosnian refugees who fled the
  Yugoslav Wars in the mid-1990s. Deeply influenced by her experience growing up in
  a Bosnian diaspora community, she is eager to uncover elements of Bosnian culture
  that were obscured by a childhood spent assimilating. She is an avid rock climber,
  traveler, and language-learner.</p>"
