title: 和镜子睡在一起
author: Yan An
translator: Chen Du and Xisheng Chen
poem: |
  一只白天鹅
  （也许仅仅是一个类似的白乎乎的事物）
  和它的不太真实的白
  在秋天的天池里
  在比新疆还远的地方
  和镜子睡在一起

  一块有弯度的巨石和它的黑青苔
  和一大堆白花花的鸟粪
  在大河上空的危崖上
  在古代的风中    在一只试图确定
  飞翔姿态的鸟的翅翼下
  和时间睡在一起

  一条蛇在丛林中蜕掉白皮
  （这一切只是在想象之中）
  追逐一只饥饿的老虎未果
  在迷失了返回洞穴的道路之后
  由于恐惧而仓皇逃窜
  天黑之前它要赶到旷野上
  和乌云    月亮睡在一起

  我父亲和他的白发
  以及他的黑皮中的白骨
  今夜在故乡的梦中和我的梦中
  闪着无处安放的白花花的寒光
  和某种难以名状的忧伤
  和北方的群山睡在一起
transpoem: |
  A white swan
  (Or maybe just a similar whitish thing)
  And its somewhat unreal whiteness
  In an autumn heavenly lake
  A place farther than Xinjiang
  Are sleeping with a mirror

  A massive, curved boulder with black moss
  And a large heap of shining-white bird droppings
  On a precipitous cliff above a great river
  In the ancient wind, under the wings
  Of a bird determining its flight gesture
  Are sleeping with time

  A snake having sloughed off its white skin in a jungle
  (All these exist only in imagination)
  Fruitlessly chased a hungry tiger
  Lost its way back to its pit
  And hence fled hurriedly out of fright
  Needs to hasten to the moors before night falls
  To sleep with gloomy clouds and the moon

  My father and his grey hair
  As well as his white bones under his dark skin
  All glittering with chilling white shimmers
  With nowhere to rest
  And with certain indescribable melancholy
  In the homeland's dreams and mine tonight
  Are sleeping with the northern mountains

  <p>Yan An’s poems are highly experimental, unconventional, and unique according to the standards and traditions of Chinese culture, considering their aesthetic value, contents, philosophical denotations and meanings. As a pioneer in modern westernized Chinese poetry, Yan An has completely transformed Chinese readers’ concepts and understanding of poetry through his unique views about the universe, life, society, and people. His way of thinking is unusual and unconventional. His poems do not contain any of the Chinese elements traditionally and commonly depicted by other Chinese poets and even if they do, they are addressed from unique perspectives. Therefore, they can transcend the boundaries between nations and cultures, reaching for a wider audience across the world. In each of his poems, behind his boundless imagination, there lies a story and Yan An’s sentiments and understandings of life, people, society, and the universe.</p>

  <p>His language is intense and abstract. Just like his other poems, these poems are rich in imagery and literary devices, such as metaphor, personification, and parallelism. These literary devices have well served their purpose in the Chinese versions. Nevertheless, in their English versions, some transcreation techniques have to be exploited to retain the same or similar effect.</p>

  <p>For example, the omission and restructuring techniques are combined together in translating the first two lines of the first stanza of the poem “Onlooker.” In particular, “his” is omitted, “wearing a broad-brimmed straw hat” is restructured from the first line to the second line, and “the suspicious odyssey” is restructured from the second line to the third line. Also, the spaces are switched to English conventions to make the translation more elegant. In order to delete some of the spaces, conjunctions are used as in the case of “and” and “who” in the first and second line of the second stanza respectively.</p>

  <p>All in all, we have attempted to bring something new and foreign into English to enrich it, by helping English poets and readers unleash their creativity, imagination, inspiration, and by bridging or integrating American and Chinese culture and ways of thinking. Also, we have endeavored to create some novel transcreation techniques to help with any future translation of Yan An’s poems.</p>
