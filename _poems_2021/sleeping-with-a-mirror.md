transtitle: Sleeping with a Mirror
author: Yan An
translator: Chen Du; Xisheng Chen
poem: "一只白天鹅\r\n（也许仅仅是一个类似的白乎乎的事物）\r\n和它的不太真实的白\r\n在秋天的天池里\r\n在比新疆还远的地方\r\n和镜子睡在一起\r\n\r\n一块有弯度的巨石和它的黑青苔\r\n和一大堆白花花的鸟粪\r\n在大河上空的危崖上\r\n在古代的风中
  \   在一只试图确定\r\n飞翔姿态的鸟的翅翼下\r\n和时间睡在一起\r\n\r\n一条蛇在丛林中蜕掉白皮\r\n（这一切只是在想象之中）\r\n追逐一只饥饿的老虎未果\r\n在迷失了返回洞穴的道路之后\r\n由于恐惧而仓皇逃窜\r\n天黑之前它要赶到旷野上\r\n和乌云
  \   月亮睡在一起\r\n\r\n我父亲和他的白发\r\n以及他的黑皮中的白骨\r\n今夜在故乡的梦中和我的梦中\r\n闪着无处安放的白花花的寒光\r\n和某种难以名状的忧伤\r\n和北方的群山睡在一起"
transpoem: "A white swan\r\n(Or maybe just a similar whitish thing)\r\nAnd its somewhat
  unreal whiteness\r\nIn an autumn heavenly lake\r\nA place farther than Xinjiang\r\nAre
  sleeping with a mirror\r\n\r\nA massive, curved boulder with black moss\r\nAnd a
  large heap of shining-white bird droppings\r\nOn a precipitous cliff above a great
  river\r\nIn the ancient wind, under the wings\r\nOf a bird determining its flight
  gesture\r\nAre sleeping with time\r\n\r\nA snake having sloughed off its white skin
  in a jungle\r\n(All these exist only in imagination)\r\nFruitlessly chased a hungry
  tiger\r\nLost its way back to its pit\r\nAnd hence fled hurriedly out of fright\r\nNeeds
  to hasten to the moors before night falls\r\nTo sleep with gloomy clouds and the
  moon\r\n\r\nMy father and his grey hair\r\nAs well as his white bones under his
  dark skin\r\nAll glittering with chilling white shimmers\r\nWith nowhere to rest\r\nAnd
  with certain indescribable melancholy\r\nIn the homeland’s dreams and mine tonight\r\nAre
  sleeping with the northern mountains"
note: "<p>Yan An’s poems are highly experimental, unconventional, and unique according
  to the standards and traditions of Chinese culture, considering their aesthetic
  value, contents, philosophical denotations and meanings. As a pioneer in modern
  Westernized Chinese poetry, Yan An has completely transformed Chinese readers’ concepts
  and understanding of poetry through his unique views about the universe, life, society,
  and people. His way of thinking is unusual and unconventional. His poems do not
  contain any of the Chinese elements traditionally and commonly depicted by other
  Chinese poets and even if they do, they are addressed from unique perspectives.
  Therefore, they can transcend the boundaries between nations and cultures, reaching
  for a wider audience across the world. In each of his poems, behind his boundless
  imagination, there lies a story and Yan An’s sentiments and understandings of life,
  people, society, and the universe.</p>\r\n<p>His language is intense and abstract.
  Just like his other poems, these poems are rich in imagery and literary devices,
  such as metaphor, personification, and parallelism. These literary devices have
  well served their purpose in the Chinese versions. Nevertheless, in their English
  versions, some transcreation techniques have to be exploited to retain the same
  or similar effect.</p>\r\n<p>For example, the omission and restructuring techniques
  are combined together in translating the first two lines of the first stanza of
  the poem “Onlooker.” In particular, “his” is omitted, “wearing a broad-brimmed straw
  hat” is restructured from the first line to the second line, and “the suspicious
  odyssey” is restructured from the second line to the third line. Also, the spaces
  are switched to English conventions to make the translation more elegant. In order
  to delete some of the spaces, conjunctions are used as in the case of “and” and
  “who” in the first and second line of the second stanza, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>All
  in all, we have attempted to bring something new and foreign into English to enrich
  it, by helping English poets and readers unleash their creativity, imagination,
  inspiration, and by bridging or integrating American and Chinese culture and ways
  of thinking. Also, we have endeavored to create some novel transcreation techniques
  to help with any future translation of Yan An’s poems.</p>\r\n"
