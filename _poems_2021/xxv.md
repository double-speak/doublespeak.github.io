pid: xxv
title: XXV.
transtitle: XXV.
author: Osip Mandelstam
translator: Elizabeth Balabayev
poem: "Возьми на радость из моих ладоней\r\nНемного солнца и немного меда,\r\nКак
  нам велели пчелы Персефоны.\r\n\r\nНе отвязать неприкрепленной лодки,\r\nНе услыхать
  в меха обутой тени,\r\nНе превозмочь в дремучей жизни страха.\r\n\r\nНам остаются
  только поцелуи,\r\nМохнатые, как маленькие пчелы,\r\nЧто умирают, вылетев из улья.\r\n\r\nОни
  шуршат в прозрачных дебрях ночи,\r\nИх родина — дремучий лес Тайгета,\r\nИх пища
  — время, медуница, мята.\r\n\r\nВозьми ж на радость дикий мой подарок,\r\nНевзрачное
  сухое ожерелье\r\nИз мертвых пчел, мед превративших в солнце.\r\n\r\n1920\r\nОсип
  Мандельштам"
transpoem: "Take from my palms with delight\r\nA patch of sunshine and a touch of
  honey, \r\nAs decreed by Persephone’s bees.\r\n\r\nDo not untie an unmoored boat,\r\nDo
  not listen for fur-shod shadows, \r\nDo not try to overcome a dense life of fear.
  \r\n\r\nAll that remains for us are kisses —\r\nFurry like small bees\r\nwho die
  after leaving the hive. \r\n\r\nThey rustle in the transparent, wild night,\r\nTheir
  home — the dense forests of Taygete,\r\nTheir nectar — time, Pulmonaria, mint.\r\n\r\nJust
  take with delight my savage gift,\r\nA plain necklace of her dried bees,\r\nHoney
  transformed into light. \r\n\r\n1920\r\nOsip Mandelstam"
note: <p>In “XXV,” I really wanted to do more with mythology because it should be
  noted that this poem appears in both <em>Tristia</em> (1922) and <span lang= "ru"><em>Вторая
  Книга</em></span> (<em>Second Book</em>, 1923), which were written during Mandelstam’s
  exile in Crimea. <em>Tristia</em> refers to Ovid’s Tristia, who was also exiled
  from Rome to the Crimea. I added the word “her” in the penultimate line and changed
  “Taygetos” to “Taygete” in order to highlight neoclassical themes. Mandelstam intersperses
  rhyming couplets throughout the poem, but it’s nearly impossible to recreate a rhyme
  scheme in another language. I relied on internal rhyme, slant rhyme, and some end
  rhymes to somewhat capture that effect. I also ran into a problem with “Pulmonaria,”
  which is <span lang= "ru"><em>медуница</em></span> (“medutsina”) in Russian, and
  sounds similar to “honey” (<span lang= "ru"><em>мёд</em></span> or “meyod”). The
  obvious choice would have been “honeysuckle,” which I’ve seen in other translations,
  but I wanted to create a connection between Persephone at the beginning of the poem
  by capitalizing Pulmonaria. Pulmonaria is commonly called lungwort, and is used
  to treat asthma and bronchitis in folk remedies. It is a small, purple flower; the
  name partially betrays its color. It’s a shade-loving plant and, along with the
  color, creates an echo of Persephone’s dark underworld- and pomegranate-stained
  hands.</p>
abio: <p>Osip Mandelstam was born in Warsaw, Poland, Russian Empire, on January 14,
  1891. His family moved to St. Petersburg soon after and he was educated at the prestigious
  Tenishev School, where Pushkin attended. He then studied at the Sorbonne in Paris,
  the University of Heidelburg, and the University of St. Petersburg, converting from
  Judaism to Methodism so that he could attend the latter. He was a founding member
  of the Poets Guild, with Gumilev, Akhmatova, and Gorodetsky, which created the Acmeist
  movement in Russian poetry. His poetry collections include <span lang= "ru"><em>Каминь</em></span>
  (<em>Stone</em>, 1913), <em>Trista</em> (1922), <span lang= "ru"><em>Вторая Книга</em></span>
  (<em>Second Book</em>, 1923), as well as essays, short prose, and literary criticism
  in <em>The Noise of Time</em> and <em>Feodosiya</em> (both 1925) and <em>The Egyptian
  Stamp</em> (1928). He also worked as a translator. In 1934 he was arrested for his
  poem, “Stalin Epigram,” and was sent to a transit camp in Vladivostok. Later, he
  was exiled with his wife, Nadezhda, to Cherdyn in the Northern Urals. Mandelstam
  was arrested a second time during Stalin’s Great Terror and was sent back to Vladivostok,
  where he died on December 27, 1938, of starvation.</p>
