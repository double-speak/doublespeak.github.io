poem: "Jeg bor i fjeldet. \nI uger har jeg ikke set et menneske, \nikke hørt min egen
  røst. \nJeg hører mig selv tænke, \nmens tjernet skvulper. \nRøde skyer drager forbi.
  \nDet mørknes, \nfjeldvandet blir sort, lommen skriger. \nDer farer en angst igjennem
  mig. \nHvor er de nu alle? Hvad gjør de? \nLever de end nu? Lever mine brødre, \nmenneskene?\nOg
  fjeldet blir pludselig så isnende koldt. \nDet har intet hjerte. \nJeg må ned,
  bag den borteste blåne, \nsøndenfor de brede sletter, \nder hvor hjerter slår,
  \nder hvor tusender hjerter slår i kor. \nJeg iler til dalen, \njeg gjemmer mig
  i kupeen. \nHele natten pruster jernvognen, \nlyner afsted i mulm og mørke, \ngjennem
  lange, dybe dale, \nover brede sletter. \nNæste aften står jeg på den stenlagte
  gade. \nDer er ingen skog lenger, \nmen huse og huse og vinduer, \ningen sus gjennem
  blade, \nmen surren af vogne, \nlarm af utallige fødder. \nLangt borte hører jeg
  et forfærdeligt skrig. \nHvem lider? \nJeg løber efter skriget. \nOg jeg hører ud
  fra åbne \nvinduer en brølende røst: \n«Forfærdes, I mænd og kvinder, \nI rådne
  kar, Eders skiddenhed \ner værre end øglers, \nEders synder er utallige \nsom havets
  sand. – – \nAngst løber jeg videre. \nJeg kømmer forbi et hus, \nhvor der er mange
  mennesker. \nJeg ser dem sidde langs væggene, \nde snakker ikke til hinanden, \nde
  smiler ikke til hinanden. \nOg jeg blir mer og mer angst.\nJeg kømmer forbi dansebuler
  \nmed mænd og kvinder, \nder sparker hinanden tilblods. \nEr dette mine brødre,
  menneskene? \nJeg løber videre og videre. \nJeg blir mere og mere angst. \nIngen
  taler til hinanden, \ningen smiler til hinanden. \nDe farer afsted, som var de piskede,
  \nog ud fra de små huse hører \njeg gråt og hulken,\nbag mig gråter det, gråter,
  gråter… \nOg omsider går det op før mig, \nomsider ser jeg det: \nDe er vanvittige,
  \nde piskes af sin egen skygge. \nOg jeg ser mig om, \njeg ser på deres øine, \nderes
  miner, deres ilen og løben: \nJa, de er vanvittige, de er vanvittige. "
transpoem: "I live in the mountain. \nI have not seen another person in weeks, \nnor
  heard my own voice. \nWhile the pond ripples I can hear myself think.\nRed clouds
  pass by. \nThe sky darkens, \nthe mountain water blackens, the loon cries.\nFear
  spreads through me. \nWhere are they now? What are they doing? \nAre they still
  alive? Are my brothers still living, \nanybody?\nAnd the mountain suddenly \nbecomes
  icy cold. Its heart is gone.\nI must go down, \nback to the blue horizon, \nsouthward
  where the plains stretch out, \nwhere beating hearts reside, \nwhere a thousand
  hearts beat in chorus.\nI spring down the valley, \nI hide myself away in a compartment.
  \nThe wagon creaks the whole night, \nlightning strikes off in the gloom and darkness,
  \nthe plains stretch across the deep, long valley.\nThe next evening, \nI stand
  in the cobblestone street. \nThere is no longer a forest, \nbut windows and house
  after house, \nno whistling through the leaves, \njust the buzz of carts, \nthe
  noise of countless feet.\nFar off, I hear a terrible scream. \nWho is that suffering?\nI
  run after the scream. \nAnd from the open windows, \nI hear a roaring voice:\n‘Terrible!
  You men and women, \nyou rotten people, you are filthier than lizards. \nYour sins
  are as countless as sand on the beach.’ – –\nI run on in fear. \nI go past a house
  filled with people. \nI see them sitting along the walls, \nthey do not speak to
  each other, \nthey do not smile at each other.\nAnd I am filled with more and more
  fear. \nI go past a dance-joint teeming \nwith men and women, \nkicking each other
  bloody.\nAre these my brothers, these people?\nI ran farther and farther. \nI am
  filled with more and more fear. \nThey do not speak to each other; \nthey do not
  smile at each other.\nThey flit about as if whipped, \nand from a small house \nI
  hear crying and sobbing, \nbehind me they are crying, crying, crying…\nAnd at last
  this all wells up inside me, \nat last I say: \n‘They are mad! \nThey are whipped
  by their own shadow!’ \nI look them in the eye, \nsee their expressions,\nsee them
  rushing and running about, \nand I say to myself: \n‘Yes, they are mad, they are
  mad!’"
note: |-
  <p>“The City” is a prose poem by Sigbjørn Obstfelder, the father of Norwegian modernist poetry. This poem is an exceptionally good example of his work because it depicts the anxiety of Norway’s transition from a rural, pastoral society to an industrialized, modern nation. We see a country-dwelling Norwegian decide to make his way into town for a wholesome reason, only to experience an anxiety attack similar to that portrayed in Munch’s <em>Scream</em>.</p>
  <p>The work of Obstfelder is challenging to translate today because of the interlingual nature of late nineteenth-century Norway. Still a young nation at the time, Norway was heavily Danish but was emerging as modern Bokmål. Beyond that, stylistically, Obstfelder has a jerky, hyphenated style that says much with few words. The former reveals his nervous nature and the latter puts him firmly in the Norwegian tradition.</p>

  <p>Sigbjørn Obstfelder (21 November 1866–29 July 1900) was a nineteenth-century Norwegian writer, a close friend of Edvard Munch, an inspiration to Rainier Maria Rilke, and the father of modernist Norwegian poetry. His poem “Jeg Ser” is known by all Norwegians and mimics the sense of alienation depicted in Munch’s famous painting <em>The Scream.</em></p>
  <p>In 1890, Obstfelder moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but after only a year, he had a nervous breakdown and returned to Norway. After several years of moving around with the Norwegian intellectual scene, he died of tuberculosis at the age of thirty-three on the same day as the birth of his only child Lili.</p>
