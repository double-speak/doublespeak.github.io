transtitle: If Heritage Were Called Hither-Air
author: Marica Bodrožić
translator: Qingyang Zhou
poem: "Wenn die Herkunft Herluft hiesse,\r\nkönnte ich sagen,\r\nich sei ein Mensch
  aus Wolken, könnte ich sagen,\r\nich sei ein Gebiet des Wetters und niemand störte\r\nsich
  an meiner jugoslawischen Geburt, auch ich\r\nselbst nicht. Mein Wetter wäre jeder
  Tag, wäre\r\nein Sonnentausch das Einfachste auf der Welt.\r\nMit den Lungen ginge
  ich auf Andromeda spazieren,\r\nfüllte die Venus aus mit einem katzengleichen Sprung.\r\nHer
  Luft!, könnte ich dann sagen und lachen dabei,\r\nweil das Ernsthafte alt in mir
  geworden ist, ein Zuspieler\r\nder Wartenden, der da Hockenden, der auf die Grenzöffnungen
  \r\nHoffenden. Menschen sind mir dabei vertraut geworden, \r\nimmerhin. Eine ganze
  Zeit lang dachte ich, Menschen\r\nseien wohl das Letzte, an das ich mich hier auf
  Erden\r\ngewöhnen könnte. Dabei das Maß der Bäume, immer,\r\nvor Augen, wie sie
  Fähige sind, Fähige, den Regen \r\nEmpfangende. An einem Sonntag, es war in der
  Stadt\r\nBerlin, es war ein Regentag, es war eine eigene Stunde,\r\nda sah ich den
  einen Turm von dreizehn volljährigen Türmen.\r\nIch wuchs so aus der Erde heraus
  und bekam\r\ndie Gelegenheit zu einer Rede. Ich sagte mir selbst,\r\nwäre ein jeder
  der Türme aus Licht, ginge die Herkunft\r\nmich wirklich nichts mehr an. Da ich
  das dachte,\r\ntönte die solare Quelle sich in meiner Küche ein,\r\nder dreizehnte
  Turm gab sich zu erkennen. Ich hörte\r\ndeutlich, wie sein Name Wahrheit wurde,
  meine\r\nWahrheit, ich übte Verzicht, ich ließ los das Gewesene,\r\nam liebsten
  hätte ich auch meinen Namen an die\r\nWache abgegeben, so übermütig und froh
  war ich.\r\nDer Mann sagte aber, behalte ihn, er wird dir helfen,\r\ndich hier und
  dort, mit Schuhen oder ohne, mit deinen\r\nFüßen und der Queste der Seele fortzubewegen."
transpoem: "If Heritage were called Hither-Air,\r\nI could say,\r\nI was a person
  of clouds. I could say,\r\nI was a turf of weather and no one was disturbed\r\nBy
  my Yugoslavian birth, not even \r\nMyself. Each day would be my weather.\r\nA change
  of sunlight would be the simplest thing on this world.\r\nWith the lungs I’d stroll
  on Andromeda,\r\nFill up Venus with a catlike leap.\r\nHither, Air! I could then
  say while laughing,\r\nSince the most serious part of me aged, a playmate\r\nOf
  the ones waiting, of the ones crouching, of the ones hoping \r\nFor the borders
  to open. People became familiar to me,\r\nAfter all. For quite some time, I thought
  people\r\nWere perhaps the last thing I would be accustomed to\r\nHere on Earth.
  While the magnitude of the trees is always\r\nIn my mind, how capable they are,
  capable, \r\nOf receiving the rain. On a Sunday, it was in the city of \r\nBerlin,
  it was a rainy day, it was an hour of its own,\r\nWhen I saw one tower among thirteen
  full-fledged towers.\r\nI thus grew out of the Earth and received\r\nThe opportunity
  for a speech. I said to myself,\r\nIf each of the towers were made of light, the
  heritage\r\nWould no longer concern me. As I thought so,\r\nThe sunbeams tinted
  my kitchen,\r\nThe thirteenth tower revealed itself. I heard\r\nClearly, how its
  name became truth, my\r\nTruth. I relinquish, I let go of what had been.\r\nPreferably
  I would have given my name\r\nTo the guard, so jaunty and joyful was I.\r\nBut the
  man said, keep it, it will help you,\r\nMove here and there, with shoes or without,
  with your\r\nFeet and the quest of the soul."
note: "<p>Bodrožić’s poem contains plenty of neologisms, which encourage the translator
  to experiment with the target language and actively interpret the meaning of the
  poem in order to find the best translation. For instance, the word “Herluft” in
  the title is entirely the poet’s original creation. I chose to translate it as “Hither-Air”
  in order to evoke a poetic tone and to create an alliteration with the preceding
  word, “heritage,” (<em>Herkunft</em>). The word <em>Gebiet</em> in the fourth line
  can be translated as area, territory, region, zone, domain, or sphere. I initially
  decided to use “territory,” since the narrator appears to be quite possessive of
  her heritage. However, in English, “territory” triggers associations with the animal
  world, which is perhaps not the original intention of the poet. I eventually chose
  “turf,” since it can be defined as “an area or sphere of activity regarded as someone’s
  personal territory,” which transitions well into the discussion of the narrator’s
  Yugoslavian birth in the following line. Bodrožić also describes towers (<em>Türme</em>)
  as <em>volljährig</em>, which means “full-aged,” “mature,” or “adult,” bestowing
  human qualities on inanimate objects. The adjective that I chose in the translation,
  “full-fledged,” can be used to describe both people and objects. This word might
  sound less strange to English speakers, without deviating too much from the original
  text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though difficult decisions had to be made in the translation
  process, the linguistic affinities of English and German can sometimes allow for
  the transmission of similar tones, feelings, and sensations. One of the most striking
  features of the poem is the use of the subjunctive mode. My English translation
  preserves this feature, thus conveying the narrator’s unbounded imaginations and
  intense longing for the realization of fictional situations. The original German
  segment of “ein Zuspieler / der Wartenden, der da Hockenden, der auf die Grenzöffnungen
  / Hoffenden” has a rhythmic flow, since all the short phrases end with <em>en</em>.
  To create a similar auditory experience in English, I chose to terminate each clause
  of the translation with <em>ing</em>, even though in German grammar <em>Wartenden</em>,
  <em>Hockendedn</em>, and <em>Hoffenden</em> all function as adjectives, rather than
  as verbs.</p>\r\n"
abio: "<p>Marica Bodrožić is a German writer of Croatian descent. She was born in
  1973 in Svib in former Yugoslavia and immigrated to Hessen, Germany, at age ten.
  Bodrožić began publishing novels and essays in German in 2002, while also working
  as a translator of English literature into Croatian. As a former guest professor
  at Dartmouth College, she taught German poetry from the twentieth century to the
  present. One of her best-known literary works is the novel <em>Kirschholz und alte
  Gefühle</em> (<em>A Cherrywood Table</em>), which received the EU Prize for Literature
  in 2013. Her writing often reminisces her childhood in a socialist country and discusses
  the possibility of personal empowerment through language. Regarding German as her
  “second mother tongue,” Bodrožić frequently strives to transcend linguistic limitations
  through neologism in her poems and novels. In 2007, she co-directed a documentary
  with Katja Gasser, titled <em>Herzgemälde der Erinnerung – Eine Reise durch mein
  Kroatien</em> (<em>Heart Painting of Memory: A Journey through My Croatia</em>).
  Dedicated to eliminating linguistic barriers between member states of the former
  Yugoslavia, Bodrožić signed the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats,
  Serbs, Bosniaks, and Montenegrins in 2017. She currently lives in Berlin.</p>"

  from Penn in 2020 with a BA in German, comparative literature, and cinema and media
  studies. Originally from Shenzhen, China, Freya is interested in the intersections
  of German-Asian cultures, particularly as they pertain to the collaborations between
  East/West Germany, China/Taiwan, and North/South Korea during the Cold War and beyond.
  She has published academic articles on queer cinema, German and Israeli literature,
  interactions between Jewish refugees and the Chinese in Shanghai during World War
  II, and East German portrayals of China in literary and filmic travelogues.</p>"
