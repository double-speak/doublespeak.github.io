translator: Claudia Nuñez de Ibieta
poem: "Día 1  \r\nNo te tengo miedo, \r\nvi derrumbarse \r\ncosas más imponentes \r\nque
  tus prejuicios.\r\n\r\nDía 15 \r\nLe escribo poemas de desamor \r\na mi oficio \r\nque
  me prometió cosas y no cumplió. \r\nLe escribo poemas de desamor \r\na los movimientos
  políticos \r\nen los que busqué refugio y no encontré. \r\nLe escribo poemas de
  desamor \r\na mis poemas viejos \r\nque no tienen la fuerza que necesito \r\nque
  me envíen desde el pasado. \r\nNo le escribo esos poemas \r\na las personas que
  amé: \r\npara ellas la promesa \r\nde que voy a seguir tratando de ilusionarme \r\ncomo
  si no hubiéramos aprendido juntas \r\nque casi todo termina mal.\r\n\r\nDía 20 \r\nMi
  profesor de historia \r\ndel secundario \r\ntambién era escritor y nos decía \r\nque
  teníamos que crecer para contar \r\nnuestra historia afuera \r\ndel frasco de mayonesa.
  \r\nNunca estuve segura \r\na qué se refería: \r\nal colegio de monjas, \r\nal conurbano,
  \r\na la clase media. \r\nMe esforcé por salir \r\ndel frasco \r\nmirarlo en perspectiva
  \r\nentender qué había adentro \r\ny qué había afuera. \r\nNo pude,  \r\na donde
  voy \r\nmi contexto viene conmigo \r\ncreo que no quiero contar  \r\nmis aventuras
  afuera del frasco \r\nquiero mostrar \r\ncomo veo el mundo desde ahí. \r\n\r\nDía
  25 \r\nYo no subo poemas  \r\na las redes sociales \r\ndice alguien que no sé \r\ndónde
  cree que tienen que estar: \r\nen un libro cerrado \r\nen la universidad \r\nen
  manos de la crítica \r\nen un cajón \r\ndonde no pueda encontrarlos nadie \r\n“que
  no los merezca.”\r\nYo no quiero  \r\ndejar mis poemas en ningún lado \r\ndonde
  no pueda  \r\nencontrarlos cualquiera, por ejemplo yo \r\na los trece, a los quince
  \r\ncuando no sabía qué libros comprarme \r\ncuando vivía en Ciudadela \r\ncuando
  no leía poesía."
transpoem: "Day 1\r\nI’m not afraid of you,\r\nI’ve seen the collapse \r\nof more
  impressive things\r\nthan your prejudice.\r\n\r\nDay 15\r\nI write unlove poems
  \r\nto my craft\r\nthat made me promises and didn’t keep them.\r\nI write unlove
  poems \r\nto the political movements\r\nwhere I sought refuge and didn’t find it.\r\nI
  write unlove poems \r\nto my old poems\r\nthat haven’t got the strength I need \r\nthem
  to send me from the past.\r\nI don’t write those poems \r\nto the people I loved:\r\nfor
  them the promise\r\nthat I will keep holding on to hopes\r\nas if we hadn’t learned
  together \r\nthat almost everything ends badly.\r\n\r\nDay 20\r\nMy high-school
  history \r\nteacher\r\nwas also a writer and used to say\r\nwe needed to grow up
  to tell\r\nour story outside\r\nthe jar of mayonnaise.\r\nI was never sure\r\nwhat
  he meant by it:\r\nthe school run by nuns,\r\nthe suburbs,\r\nthe middle class.\r\nI
  made an effort to get out\r\nof the jar\r\nto look at it in perspective\r\nto understand
  what was inside it\r\nand what was outside.\r\nI couldn’t,\r\nwherever I go\r\nmy
  context comes with me\r\nI think I don’t want to tell\r\nmy adventures outside the
  jar\r\nI want to show\r\nhow I see the world from there.\r\n\r\nDay 25\r\nI don’t
  post poems\r\non social media\r\nsays someone whom I don’t \r\nknow where they think
  poems should be:\r\nin a closed book\r\nin a university\r\nin the hands of critics\r\nin
  a drawer\r\nwhere no one can find them\r\n“who doesn’t deserve them.”\r\nI don’t
  want\r\nto leave my poems anywhere\r\nthey can’t be \r\nfound by anyone, for instance
  me\r\nat age thirteen, at fifteen\r\nwhen I didn’t know which books to buy\r\nwhen
  I lived in Ciudadela\r\nwhen I didn’t read poetry."
note: "<p>These four poems are from <em>Cuando todo refugio se vuelva hostil</em>
  (<em>When Every Refuge Turns Hostile</em>), which Grosso published in 2019, and
  I first heard her read in 2020 during a virtual event featuring pandemic poetry.
  Just the way she had numbered her days, way before all of us began counting each
  pandemic day, proved to be an example of her signature style. Examining herself
  and her social milieu, her verses trace the coming of age and awareness of a young
  and avid reader and writer for whom words are not just the currency of everyday
  life, but a practical science. Making observations of tangible moments or psychological
  ones, Grosso questions emotions, prejudices, old habits — her own and others’. In
  clever quips, anxiety-inducing moments are brought under control by the power of
  words.</p>\r\n<p>In a sense, translating these poems into English was quite straightforward
  when it came to word choice, for meaning, but striking the same tone as the original
  is the challenge, the goal. For example, in “Day 15,” “poemas de desamor” becomes
  “unlove poems;” it seems to be an easy and transparent choice and I’m not unhappy
  with it at all, but I can’t shake the sense that the word <em>desamor</em> will
  always sound more dramatic than the word “unlove,” and I can’t change that. More
  of a puzzle, in the same poem, was the verb <em>ilusionarse</em>, for which the
  translation becomes a compound of verbs, and offers the chance to try various combinations
  until the one sounding most lyrical is found.</p>\r\n<br><p>In another poem, “Day
  20,” the use of a funny expression might have posed a puzzle, but since it’s actually
  not a widely used colloquialism necessitating a determined English equivalent, a
  literal translation worked well to elicit the same quizzical response it provokes
  in the original. Suffice it to say, the choice phrase in question, the “mayonnaise
  jar” from which Grosso decides not to remove herself, serves as the phrase with
  which she declares where she is writing <em>from</em>. It’s an imaginative metaphor,
  a form she often employs, along with her wry humor, to surpass or solve the question
  posed by the poem. In her well-meditated but short answers, her poetry empowers
  both writer and reader. Her succinct texts, born into a world of strong social media
  use, are <strong>meant</strong> to be shared widely. The fact that Grosso is adamant
  that anyone should be able to find her poems — “anyone, for instance me at age thirteen,
  at fifteen, when I didn’t know which books to buy, when I lived in Ciudadela, when
  I didn’t read poetry” — has garnered her thousands of enthusiastic Spanish-language
  readers and followers. It’s the translator’s intention that this generation of English-language
  readers have the chance to engage as well.</p>"
