transtitle: Four Poems
author: Tamara Grosso
translator: Claudia Nuñez de Ibieta
poem: "Día 1  \nNo te tengo miedo, \nvi derrumbarse \ncosas más imponentes \nque tus
  prejuicios.\n\nDía 15 \nLe escribo poemas de desamor \na mi oficio \nque me prometió
  cosas y no cumplió. \nLe escribo poemas de desamor \na los movimientos políticos
  \nen los que busqué refugio y no encontré. \nLe escribo poemas de desamor \na mis
  poemas viejos \nque no tienen la fuerza que necesito \nque me envíen desde el pasado.
  \nNo le escribo esos poemas \na las personas que amé: \npara ellas la promesa \nde
  que voy a seguir tratando de ilusionarme \ncomo si no hubiéramos aprendido juntas
  \nque casi todo termina mal.\n\nDía 20 \nMi profesor de historia \ndel secundario
  \ntambién era escritor y nos decía \nque teníamos que crecer para contar \nnuestra
  historia afuera \ndel frasco de mayonesa. \nNunca estuve segura \na qué se refería:
  \nal colegio de monjas, \nal conurbano, \na la clase media. \nMe esforcé por salir
  \ndel frasco \nmirarlo en perspectiva \nentender qué había adentro \ny qué había
  afuera. \nNo pude,  \na donde voy \nmi contexto viene conmigo \ncreo que no quiero
  contar  \nmis aventuras afuera del frasco \nquiero mostrar \ncomo veo el mundo desde
  ahí. \n\nDía 25 \nYo no subo poemas  \na las redes sociales \ndice alguien que no
  sé \ndónde cree que tienen que estar: \nen un libro cerrado \nen la universidad
  \nen manos de la crítica \nen un cajón \ndonde no pueda encontrarlos nadie \n“que
  no los merezca.”\nYo no quiero  \ndejar mis poemas en ningún lado \ndonde no pueda
  \ \nencontrarlos cualquiera, por ejemplo yo \na los trece, a los quince \ncuando
  no sabía qué libros comprarme \ncuando vivía en Ciudadela \ncuando no leía poesía."
transpoem: "Day 1\nI’m not afraid of you,\nI’ve seen the collapse \nof more impressive
  things\nthan your prejudice.\n\nDay 15\nI write unlove poems \nto my craft\nthat
  made me promises and didn’t keep them.\nI write unlove poems \nto the political
  movements\nwhere I sought refuge and didn’t find it.\nI write unlove poems \nto
  my old poems\nthat haven’t got the strength I need \nthem to send me from the past.\nI
  don’t write those poems \nto the people I loved:\nfor them the promise\nthat I will
  keep holding on to hopes\nas if we hadn’t learned together \nthat almost everything
  ends badly.\n\nDay 20\nMy high-school history \nteacher\nwas also a writer and used
  to say\nwe needed to grow up to tell\nour story outside\nthe jar of mayonnaise.\nI
  was never sure\nwhat he meant by it:\nthe school run by nuns,\nthe suburbs,\nthe
  middle class.\nI made an effort to get out\nof the jar\nto look at it in perspective\nto
  understand what was inside it\nand what was outside.\nI couldn’t,\nwherever I go\nmy
  context comes with me\nI think I don’t want to tell\nmy adventures outside the jar\nI
  want to show\nhow I see the world from there.\n\nDay 25\nI don’t post poems\non
  social media\nsays someone whom I don’t \nknow where they think poems should be:\nin
  a closed book\nin a university\nin the hands of critics\nin a drawer\nwhere no one
  can find them\n“who doesn’t deserve them.”\nI don’t want\nto leave my poems anywhere\nthey
  can’t be \nfound by anyone, for instance me\nat age thirteen, at fifteen\nwhen I
  didn’t know which books to buy\nwhen I lived in Ciudadela\nwhen I didn’t read poetry."
note: |-
  <p>These four poems are from <em>Cuando todo refugio se vuelva hostil</em> (<em>When Every Refuge Turns Hostile</em>), which Grosso published in 2019, and I first heard her read in 2020 during a virtual event featuring pandemic poetry. Just the way she had numbered her days, way before all of us began counting each pandemic day, proved to be an example of her signature style. Examining herself and her social milieu, her verses trace the coming of age and awareness of a young and avid reader and writer for whom words are not just the currency of everyday life, but a practical science. Making observations of tangible moments or psychological ones, Grosso questions emotions, prejudices, old habits — her own and others’. In clever quips, anxiety-inducing moments are brought under control by the power of words.</p>
  <p>In a sense, translating these poems into English was quite straightforward when it came to word choice, for meaning, but striking the same tone as the original is the challenge, the goal. For example, in “Day 15,” “poemas de desamor” becomes “unlove poems;” it seems to be an easy and transparent choice and I’m not unhappy with it at all, but I can’t shake the sense that the word <em>desamor</em> will always sound more dramatic than the word “unlove,” and I can’t change that. More of a puzzle, in the same poem, was the verb <em>ilusionarse</em>, for which the translation becomes a compound of verbs, and offers the chance to try various combinations until the one sounding most lyrical is found.</p>
  <br><p>In another poem, “Day 20,” the use of a funny expression might have posed a puzzle, but since it’s actually not a widely used colloquialism necessitating a determined English equivalent, a literal translation worked well to elicit the same quizzical response it provokes in the original. Suffice it to say, the choice phrase in question, the “mayonnaise jar” from which Grosso decides not to remove herself, serves as the phrase with which she declares where she is writing <em>from</em>. It’s an imaginative metaphor, a form she often employs, along with her wry humor, to surpass or solve the question posed by the poem. In her well-meditated but short answers, her poetry empowers both writer and reader. Her succinct texts, born into a world of strong social media use, are <strong>meant</strong> to be shared widely. The fact that Grosso is adamant that anyone should be able to find her poems — “anyone, for instance me at age thirteen, at fifteen, when I didn’t know which books to buy, when I lived in Ciudadela, when I didn’t read poetry” — has garnered her thousands of enthusiastic Spanish-language readers and followers. It’s the translator’s intention that this generation of English-language readers have the chance to engage as well.</p>
