transtitle: To a Black Dancer
author: David Diop
translator: Samantha DeStefano
poem: "Négresse ma chaude rumeur d’Afrique\nMa terre d’énigme et mon fruit de raison\nTu
  es danse par la joie nue de ton sourire\nPar l’offrande de tes seins et tes secrets
  pouvoirs\nTu es danse par les légendes d’or des nuits nuptiales\nPar les temps nouveaux
  et les rythmes séculaires\nNégresse triomphe multiplié de rêves et d’étoiles \nMaîtresse
  docile à l’étreinte des koras\nTu es danse par le vertige\nPar la magie des reins
  recommençant le monde\nTu es danse\nEt les mythes autour de moi brûlent\nAutour
  de moi les perruques du savoir\nEn grands feux de joie dans le ciel de tes pas \nTu
  es danse\nEt brûlent les faux dieux sous ta flamme verticale\nTu es le visage de
  l’initié\nSacrifiant la folie auprès de l’arbre-gardien\nTu es l’idée du Tout et
  la voix de l’Ancien.\nLancée grave à l’assaut des chimères\nTu es le Verbe qui explose\nEn
  gerbes miraculeuses sur les côtes de l’oubli."
transpoem: "Black woman my hot rumble of Africa\nMy land of enigma and my fruit of
  reason\nYou are dance by the nude joy of your smile\nBy the offering of your breasts
  and your secret powers\nYou are dance by the golden legends of wedding nights\nBy
  new times and ancient rhythms \nBlack woman unceasing triumph of dreams and stars\nDocile
  mistress in the kora harps’ embrace\nYou are dance by the giddiness\nBy the magic
  of loins beginning the world anew\nYou are dance\nAnd the myths around me burn\nAround
  me the wigs of learning\nIn great fires of joy in the sky of your steps\nYou are
  dance\nAnd false gods burn beneath your vertical flame\nYou are the face of the
  initiate\nSacrificing folly beneath the guardian tree\nYou are the idea of All and
  the voice of the Ancient.\nGravely hurled to attack chimeras\nYou are the Word that
  explodes\nIn miraculous bursts on the coasts of oblivion.\n"
note: |
  <p>In “To a Black Dancer,” which is often considered David Diop’s best poem, Diop celebrates the beauty, grace, and exuberance of an African woman who is performing a traditional dance. European Surrealism’s surprising juxtapositions of seemingly unrelated images and endorsement of revolutionary movements influenced Négritude poets’ writing style and anticolonial politics, both of which are evident in Diop’s experimental poem.</p>
  <p><em>Rumeur</em> can mean either “rumor” or “murmur, hum, rumble,” an ambiguity which has divided other translators. I chose to translate it as “rumble” to convey the dancer’s earthshaking impact on the world and to enrich the description of her dancing with a visceral sense of sound and movement. She is not a vague “rumor of Africa” but a powerful creative force rendered in energetic images, an ecstatic personification of Africa and its vibrant traditional culture. Négritude poets often used Black female figures as symbols of Africa’s strength and potential for regeneration. Like Léopold Sédar Senghor’s poem “Black Woman” (translated by Donnisa Edmonds in the Spring 2018 issue of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>) but with more concrete imagery, Diop uses a sensual woman to evoke Africa. The dancer’s vitality embodies Diop’s pride that Africa’s present attributes and ancient traditions would redeem the continent from the damage done by colonialism.</p>
  <p><em>Multiplié</em> literally means “multiplied,” but I translated it as “unceasing” to better express the idea of repeated triumphs and the proliferation “of dreams and stars” that they produce. A kora is a West African harp, so I translated <em>koras</em> as “kora harps” to define the term for an American audience and to enrich the poem’s depiction of traditional African rituals with the musical instrument that accompanies the dance. <em>Les perruques du savoir</em> (“the wigs of learning”) refers to the wigs worn as status symbols by wealthy, formally educated Europeans during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when their nations began colonizing Africa. By burning these wigs along with European “myths” and “false gods” in the flames generated by the dancer, Diop rejects French cultural imperialism and asserts the authority of African knowledge and ways of life.</p>
abio: "<p>David Diop was born to a Senegalese father (a cousin of Léopold Sédar Senghor)
  and a Cameroonian mother in 1927 in Bordeaux, France. Throughout his life, he divided
  his time between West Africa and France. He was a radical voice of Négritude, a
  twentieth-century Francophone African and Caribbean literary movement that was inspired
  by the Harlem Renaissance and Black poets such as Langston Hughes. Négritude’s goal
  was to promote pride in a rich Black culture as a reaction against oppressive French
  colonial rule. Diop’s protest poetry is more militant than that of African poets
  like Senghor. His writings display the commitment to African liberation and revolt
  against colonialism found in Caribbean poets like Aimé Césaire.  Diop contributed
  poems to <em>Présence Africaine</em> (<em>African Presence</em>), an influential
  Parisian political and literary magazine of the African diaspora. In 1956, he published
  his only book, <em>Coups de pilon</em> (<em>Pestle Blows</em>), which was translated
  into English along with additional poems and prose pieces as <em>Hammer Blows and
  Other Writings</em> in 1973. He died in a plane crash near Dakar, Senegal, in 1960,
  days before Senghor was elected the first president of the newly independent nation.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Samantha DeStefano graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> from the University
  of Pennsylvania with a BA in English, a concentration in medieval and Renaissance
  literature, and minors in both classical studies and gender, sexuality, and women’s
  studies. At Penn, she studied Latin, Old English, and Middle English. She has published
  academic research in <em>Transcription Collection and Journal of the Penn Manuscript
  Collective</em> on a manuscript of <em>Poems, 1805–1818</em> by John Syng Dorsey,
  the author of the first American textbook of surgery, for which she translated quotations
  from Latin poetry. She published translations of David Diop’s poems “To My Mother”
  and “He Who Lost Everything” in the Spring 2020 issue of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>. She
  has near-native knowledge of Spanish, and after graduation she embarked on four
  years of intensive study of French.</p>"
