transpoem: "The last was the last of the last\r\nthe full and bitter blinding glare\r\n\r\nmaybe
  somewhere the sun’s tear echoes against a white stone\r\n\r\nso yellow\r\nlightly
  drifting higher\r\n\r\n                                                                                                      he’s
  left \r\n                                                            surely to kiss
  my last world goodbye\r\n\r\nseven weeks I have lived here,\r\nghettoized\r\nmy
  own found me here\r\nthe dandelions call out to me\r\nnear the white branch of the
  chestnut tree in the court\r\n\r\n                 ihaven’tseenanotherbutterfly
  \r\n                                                                                       nothere\r\n\r\n\r\nthat
  was surely the last, the very last\r\nButterflies don’t live here\r\n\r\n                                                                                                    in
  the ghetto."
note: "<p>I translated this poem in a very minimalistic way because I wanted to emphasize
  the sadness and emptiness of the poem. The meaning of this poem is Pavel trying
  to find hope where he is. He finds hope when he sees this beautiful yellow butterfly
  but he sees it drift away, and he never sees it again. I wanted to preserve the
  spacing and alignments of the original because I feel like it was very important
  in the original, the emphasis of him not seeing a butterfly and then the indents
  on “the ghetto” added to the importance of not seeing such a hopeful creature in
  such a sad place. The word “ghettoized” is an uncomfortable term and not a very
  common term, and I thought it fit perfectly with the literal awkwardness of the
  German language and what the poem meant, but I wanted to make sure the readers understood
  the term stick outs by making the word a bit smaller than the rest.</p>"
abio: "<p>Pavel Friedmann was a Jewish Czechslovakian poet who was famous for his
  poem “Der Schmetterling.” Very little is known about his early life. When he was
  twenty-one, he was transported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp located
  in Prague. This poem was found on a very thin piece of paper along with a lot of
  other drawings and writings from Jewish children at the camp. Pavel Friedmann was
  later transported to Auschwitz in 1944, where he died.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Karina Carreras is a senior at the University of Iowa. This semester, she
  decided to take a translation course not thinking a lot of it, and she ended up
  falling in love with translation. She didn’t realize how captivating the art of
  translation was until she started working with pieces and workshopping them with
  her peers and professor. She wanted to submit this translation because it was so
  moving in German, and she thinks English readers should have the chance to read
  it as well.</p>"
