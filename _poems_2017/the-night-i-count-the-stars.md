transtitle: The Night I Count the Stars

poem: |-
  계절이 지나가는 하늘에는
  가을로 가득 차 있습니다.

  나는 아무 걱정도 없이
  가을 속의 별들을 다 헤일 듯합니다.

  가슴속에 하나 둘 새겨지는 별을
  이제 다 못 헤는 것은
  쉬이 아침이 오는 까닭이요,
  내일 밤이 남은 까닭이요,
  아직 나의 청춘이 다하지 않은 까닭입니다.

  별 하나에 추억과
  별 하나에 사랑과
  별 하나에 쓸쓸함과
  별 하나에 동경과
  별 하나에 시와
  별 하나에 어머니, 어머니,

  어머님, 나는 별 하나에 아름다운 말 한 마디씩 불러 봅니다. 소학교 때 책상을 같이 했던 아이들의 이름과, 패, 경, 옥, 이런 이국 소녀들의 이름과 벌써 아기 어머니 된 계집애들의 이름과, 가난한 이웃 사람들의 이름과, 비둘기, 강아지, 토끼, 노새, 노루, 프랜시스 잼, 라이너 마리아 릴케, 이런 시인의 이름을 불러 봅니다.

  이네들은 너무나 멀리 있습니다.
  별이 아슬히 멀듯이.

  어머님,
  그리고 당신은 멀리 북간도에 계십니다.

  나는 무엇인지 그리워
  이 많은 별빛이 내린 언덕 위에
  내 이름자를 써 보고
  흙으로 덮어 버리었습니다.

  딴은 밤을 새워 우는 벌레는
  부끄러운 이름을 슬퍼하는 까닭입니다 .

  그러나 겨울이 지나고 나의 별에도 봄이 오면
  무덤 위에 파란 잔디가 피어나듯이
  내 이름자 묻힌 언덕 위에도
  자랑처럼 풀이 무성할 게외다.
transpoem: "In the sky where seasons pass,\nautumn fills the air.\n\nWithout any hesitation,
  \nI will count the stars deep in autumn.\n\nAll the stars engraved in my chest,\nI
  cannot count them all\nbecause morning comes too soon,\nbecause tomorrow’s evening
  still remains,\nbecause my youth is still incomplete.\n\nOne star for memory\nOne
  star for love\nOne star for loneliness\nOne star for longing\nOne star for poem\nOne
  star for mother, mother.\n \nMother, I attempt to call out to each star its beautiful
  name.\nNames of the children I shared a desk with in primary school, names of foreign
  girls such as Pae, Kyung, Ok, names of girls who have already become mothers, names
  of penniless neighbors, names of animals like pigeon, dog, rabbit, mule, deer, and
  names of poets such as Francis Jammes, Rainer Maria Rilke, \nI attempt to call them.\n\nThey
  are too far\nin the way stars are infinitely distant.\n\nAnd Mother,\nyou are far
  off in North Kando.\n\nI grieve for some unknown\non top the hill where a fountain
  of starlights falls.\nI write my name\nand cover it up with soil.\n\nAnd the cicadas
  cry through the night\nover my shameful name.\n\nBut when winter passes and spring
  arrives, even to my star,\nin the way green grass blooms on graves,\non top of the
  hill where my name is buried,\nlike pride, grass will lusciously overflow.\n"
note: |
  <p>Like many translations, the decisions on word choice and how to structure the sentences and phrases throughout were incredibly difficult. Inherently, Korean and English have grammar structures that are completely the opposite of one another, which makes forming a literal translation more difficult. In terms of word choice, in some areas I decided to take more liberties, while in others, I stayed true to the original, more so than other translations I had read. There were a few phrases in which I decided to add an extra word because I felt that in order to convey the meanings that are packed into the original word. I had to include “attempt to” or “some unknown,” rather than “call” or “something,” respectively, on their own to bring out the full impact that I received from reading the original and put it in my translation. The second “I attempt to call them” is also an emphasis that does not maintain as much power and impact in the original as in my translation. But to underline the idea that the narrator tries to call upon these stars, he is unable to fully do so because they are so far away. Further, in the original the word “cicada” is not present. Rather, it is a general term for “insect” or “bug,” but the specific insect presents not only some alliteration but also a warmer feeling and allows for a more intense auditory experience.</p>
  <p>I wanted to maintain the structure of the poem as much as possible and not exclude anything major that exists in the original in my translation. The fifth stanza seems more like prose stuck between a series of poems, but upon actually reading it, it flows relatively quickly, so I decided to keep it in the same format but included the “names of…” on a separate line so that it wouldn’t be too much of a mouthful. However, the rest of the poem remains faithful to the original to maintain the same flow and pauses. Throughout the translation, enhancing the myriad of emotions and bringing to life the visuals of each sentence, phrase, or word were the aspects I worked to pay attention to the most.</p>
abio: "<p>Yun Dong-ju was a Korean poet who was born in 1917 in the Myeongdong village
  of Jilin in China and died in 1945 at the age of twenty-seven in Fukuoka, Japan.
  From 1910 to 1945, Korea was colonized by Japan and underwent “cultural cleansing,”
  which was enacted through a series of unfair and often violent methods. Koreans
  were prohibited to speak Korean, write in Korean, own Korean books, teach and learn
  in Korean, and hold their Korean names. It soon became dangerous for Yun to write
  in Korean, as it was interpreted by the Japanese to be a rebellion. Yun’s older
  cousin, Song Mongyu, was a huge influence in his life as well. As a talented prose
  writer and an activist in the Korean independence movement, Song himself worked
  with Yun and a few other college friends to create literary magazines back in Yeonhi
  University, which is now Yeonsae University. Song potentially instilled in Yun the
  desire to refuse complete submission from the Japanese rule by continuing to write
  the Korean poetry he loved so much. Upon completing his education there, he moved
  to Rikkyo University in Tokyo and then transferred six months later to Doshisha
  University in Kyoto, where he was soon taken captive by the Japanese police to Fukushima
  prison, where he died, most likely as a victim of medical experiments. Yun never
  was able to publish his collection of poems, <em>Star, Sky, Wind, and Poetry</em>,
  because he was arrested as a revolutionary activist, but because he had given them
  to a close friend in Korea, Chong Pyong-uk, to hide until it was able to be published,
  Yun’s poems exist today for many to read.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Nadia Park is a student at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in communications
  and minoring in consumer psychology and French. As a Korean American, she was exposed
  to various cultures and languages the moment she was born and developed a passion
  for learning other languages, including Japanese and French. She loves to spend
  her free time doing pour overs, practicing yoga, and baking sweets.</p>"
