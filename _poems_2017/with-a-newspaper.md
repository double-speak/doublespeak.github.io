transtitle: With a Newspaper
author: Nizar Qabbani
translator: Michael Karam
poem: "أخرج من معطفه الجريده..\nوعلبة الثقاب\nودون أن يلاحظ اضطرابي..\nودونما اهتمام\nتناول
  السكر من أمامي.. \nذوّب في الفنجان قطعتين\nذوبني.. ذوّب قطعتين\nوبعد لحظتين\nودون
  أن يراني \nويعرف الشوق الذي اعتراني.. \nتناول المعطف من أمامي \nوغاب في الزحام\nمخلفًا
  وراءه.. الجريده\nوحيدةً\nمثلي أنا.. وحيده"
transpoem: "He took the newspaper from his coat \nand a box of matches \nnot noting
  my torment \nAnd unconcerned,\nhe grabbed the sugar in front of me \nHe stirred
  two spoonfuls into his cup.\nHe stirred me… he stirred two…\nAfter two moments\nand
  without seeing me\nand knowing the longing \nthat had taken hold of me, \nhe grabbed
  his coat in front of me\nand disappeared into the crowd\nleaving the newspaper behind
  him \nby itself\nlike me, by myself."
note: "<p>The gendered nature of the Arabic language makes clear in the original that
  the speaker is a woman. Qabbani exploits that nature in Arabic to draw parallels
  between the newspaper (which is feminine) and the speaker herself. In translating
  this poem, I make the conscious decision to not add any details in English that
  would indicate the speaker’s gender.</p>"
abio: "<p>Nizar Qabbani (1923–1998) was an iconic Arab poet who wrote of romantic
  and political despair and advocated for Arab nationalism and social freedoms for
  women. Qabbani utilized the gendered nature of Arabic to write poetry in both female
  and male voices, subverting the problematic aspects of love poetry about women by
  writing love poetry <em>as</em> women. People, young and old, in Lebanon – he lived
  in Beirut for a while – and in Syria, his home country, all know the familiar tunes
  which have popularized his work. Poetry by Qabbani is also a reminder that the people
  suffering from the war in Syria are humans who have the right to live and love too.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Michael Karam is a senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying economics
  and international relations with a math minor. He is passionate about languages
  and bringing communities together. Michael loved memorizing and reciting Qabbani’s
  poetry when he was in elementary school in Lebanon.</p>"
