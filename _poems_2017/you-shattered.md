pid: you-shattered
title: Tu ti spezzasti
transtitle: You Shattered
author: Giuseppe Ungaretti
translator: Carla Rossi
poem: |-
  I molti, immani, sparsi, grigi sassi
  Frementi ancora alle segrete fionde
  Di originarie fiamme soffocate
  Od ai terrori di fiumane vergini
  Ruinanti in implacabili carezze,
  — Sopra l’abbaglio della sabbia rigidi
  In un vuoto orizzonte, non rammenti?

  E la recline, che s’apriva all’unico
  Raccogliersi dell’ombra nella valle,
  Araucaria, anelando ingigantita,
  Volta nell’ardua selce d’erme fibre
  Più delle altre dannate refrattaria,
  Fresca la bocca di farfalle e d’erbe
  Dove le radici si tagliava,
  — Non la rammenti delirante muta
  Sopra tre palmi d’un rotondo ciottolo
  In un perfetto bilico
  Magicamente apparsa?

  Di ramo in ramo fiorrancino lieve,
  Ebbri di meraviglia gli avidi occhi
  Ne conquistavi la screziata cima,
  Temerario, musico bimbo,
  Solo per rivedere all’ilmo lucido
  D’un fondo e quieto baratro di mare
  Favolose testuggini
  Ridestarsi fra le alghe.
  Della natura estrema la tensione
  E le subacquee pompe,
  Funebri moniti.

  Alzavi le braccia come ali
  E ridavi nascita al vento
  Correndo nel peso dell’aria immota.

  Nessuno mai vide posare
  Il tuo lieve piede di danza.

  Grazia, felice,
  Non avresti potuto non spezzarti
  In una cecità tanto indurita
  Tu semplice soffio e cristallo,

  Troppo umano lampo per l’empio,
  Selvoso, accanito, ronzante
  Ruggito d’un sole d’ignudo.
transpoem: "The unnumbered, enormous, scattered, gray stones\nstill throbbing against
  secret slings\nof suffocated primal flames\nor to the terror of the relentless caresses\nof
  Amazon rushing waters,\nrigid above the dazzling sand\nalong an empty horizon, don’t
  you remember?\n\nAnd the leaning Araucaria, huge in its longing,\nthat opened toward
  \nthe only gathering of shade in the valley \ntwisting its lonely fibers into hard
  flint,\nmore resistant than the other cursed trees,\nits mouth fresh with butterflies
  and grass\nwhere it parted from its roots\ndon’t you remember? Raving, silent,\nabove
  a three-span rounded pebble,\nmagically appeared\nin a perfect, precarious balance?\n\nFrom
  branch to branch, gold-crested wren, \nyour greedy eyes drunk with awe,\nyou conquered
  the mottled summit,\nbold, musical child\nonly to see again in the shining bed\nof
  a deep and still ocean abyss\nmythical tortoises\nreawakening among seaweed.\n\nThe
  untempered tension of nature\nwith the undersea pomp,\ndeathly omens. \n\nYou used
  to raise your arms as wings\ngiving birth back to the wind \nrunning in the weight
  of still air.\n\nNobody ever saw your light\ndancing foot touch the ground.\n\nYou,
  graceful joy, \nhow could you not have shattered \nin such an inflexible blindness,\nyou,
  innocent breath, pure crystal.\n\nA flash of light too human for the heartless,\nsavage,
  relentless, stubborn\nroar of a glaring sun."

  <p>Translating poetry is not easy at all. There are many factors that come into play, like the effect that the original has on the reader, which should be kept in the translation as well.</p>
  <p>First of all it should be noticed that the original text in Italian is pretty difficult to understand. My general approach toward translation was trying to render the meanings and the ideas conveyed by Ungaretti and choosing the words as carefully as possible.</p>
  <p>The original title is “Tu ti spezzasti,” which is extremely challenging to translate while trying to keep the effect it has on the reader. <em>Spezzare</em> is a verb generally used to refer to a long object that breaks or is broken, like an arm or a branch. Moreover in Italian it is used for an idiomatic expression, <em>vita spezzata</em> — “shattered life.” It means a life that ended too soon. As for the grammatical form of the verb itself, <em>spezzarsi</em> is a reflexive verb, but Ungaretti decided to make it even stronger by adding <em>tu</em> at the beginning. I had to compromise with it, because in English I wasn’t able to find any solution that would fit while saving the purity of the English language.</p>
  <p>I love the last line of the second stanza because of the image of the “perfect precarious balance.” In Italian the word <em>bilico</em>, used in this line, is slightly different from balance or equilibrium. It has embedded in it the nuance of precariousness. There is balance, but the Italian word focuses more on the lack of stability. That’s why I believe that <em>perfect precarious balance</em> exceptionally renders this idea conveyed by the original. Also, the sounds here are quite pleasant, due to the repetition of the letter <em>p</em>: “Magically appeared / In a perfect, precarious balance.”</p>
  <p>As for the last stanza, I enjoyed trying to render the list of adjectives. The original said “empio, selvoso, accanito, ronzante,” which in my version became “heartless, savage, ruthless, stubborn.” There is a sort of correspondence between these four adjectives. The first and the third both end in <em>-less</em>; the second and the fourth both begin in <em>s-</em>. I think that overall they produce pleasant sounds, and give rhythm to the whole stanza. They pave the way to the <em>“glaring sun” of the last line. In the original the sun was “naked” (<em>ignudo</em>), but I decided to render it as “glaring.” I know that in this way I probably went against my own leading principle, namely trying to produce in the translation the same effect that the original had on the reader. Nevertheless I believe it was a necessary compromise with myself. The idea of a “glaring sun” is much more powerful, and it concludes the poem with a marvelous and melancholic image.</p>

  <p>Giuseppe Ungaretti was born on February 10, 1888, in Alexandria, Egypt, to an Italian family originating from Lucca (Tuscany). Alexandria was a cosmopolitan city, full of stimuli that sparked his interest in different places and cultures.</p>
  <p>Ungaretti is probably best remembered for his experiences during World War I. In Italy he is also known as <em>Il Poeta Soldato</em>, “the soldier poet.” In 1915, when Italy joined World War I, he decided to volunteer. World War I left a mark on his life. He got to know both the suffering of war as well as the true meaning of brotherhood. During the war he also wrote his most famous poem, the two line poem “Mattina,” which reads “M’illumino / d’immenso” (literally, “I illuminate myself of immensity”).</p>
  <p>After marrying a French woman and having two children, Ungaretti and his family moved to Brazil, where he taught Italian literature. In Brazil, his beloved son Antonietto passed away. To mourn the death of his child, Ungaretti wrote the poem “Tu ti spezzasti.” It is not one of the most well-known of Ungaretti’s poems, but it is worth reading to experience the <em>pathos</em> it bears.</p>
  <p>Giuseppe Ungaretti is certainly one of the most appreciated Italian poets of the twentieth century. What makes him great is firstly his experience of war, which gave his poetry such an introspective edge. He is also remembered for writing very incisive poems, short and concise, in which the true essence of his poetry is embedded.</p>
tbio: "<p>Carla Rossi is an exchange student from Italy studying at Penn this spring.
  Carla studies at the University of Bologna, Campus of Forlì, with majors in English
  and Spanish. She has always loved the English language with its immense vocabulary
  and thousands of ways to express nuances, and she loves the idea of transposing
  feelings and emotions from one language to another. It makes her very proud to see
  Italian poets being studied abroad.</p>"
