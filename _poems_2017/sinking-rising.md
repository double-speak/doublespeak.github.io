poem: |-
  עכשיו הירח
  פוחת וגורע
  נחר ושוקע,
  נפסד ונובל.
  ועם זאת,
  אולי ענני הגשם מצְבִּים את בטנו,
  דומה שהוא גדל.
  הינומה דקה פרושה על פני השמים.
  הירח פוחת ושוקע
  כאילו נתקטע,
  כאילו הוא נופל.
  אלה העננים הרכים
  שִלחוּ בו רקבון.
  אבל, חכה רגע,
  מאחוריו
  עולה עגול חִוֵּר,
  יְרֵחַ מחצית החודש
  שעבר בשמים לפניו,
  זורח.
  קל כגרגר בין קורי השמים,
  עבה כדלעת הבשלה.
  זה הירח הגורע
  זה הירח הנושר,
  בוא והבט בו יקירי,
  תמיד הוא חוזר.
transpoem: "Now the moon \nsinks itself\ninto the sunlight\nStill\nthe rainclouds
  might\nfill up its belly\nand it will seem larger\nA veil sails across the sky\nThe
  moon sinks \ninto the light\nClouds sent it to rot\nBut\nWait\nBehind it rises\na
  blinding ring \na half-month moon \nrising \nblinding \nLight as a seed\nin the
  seams of the sky\nRound as a gourd and as ripe\nThis is the moon that sinks\nthis
  is the moon that withers\nCome gaze at it, my dear,\nit always reappears."
note: "<p>Translating Dahlia Ravikovitch’s “Sinking rising,” or, as it is more commonly
  called, “Waxing, Waning,” posed several complications. The first was the lack of
  inflection in English. In inflecting languages such as Hebrew, the subject and tense
  is implied in each verb, so more is said in fewer words. Here, the inflecting property
  lends a sort of minimalist quality to the poem, with most lines having two words,
  and at the same time allows it a density, both words being verbs. Because the minimalism
  is tied to the content of the poem, I chose to emphasize that quality over the density
  in the translation, leaving out near-synonym verbs when the lines became too long.</p>\n<p>The
  second challenge was presenting that minimalism as being tied to the content of
  the poem, which is a simple observation of how the physical waxing and waning of
  the moon looks to us. The waxing and waning moon is an eons-old and content-laden
  metaphor in the Hebrew consciousness, and yet here it is presented with a bare simplicity,
  the matter-of-fact tone reverberating in each of the images. Ravikovitch’s gaze
  at the moon, while hinting at its rich metaphoric roots in language (the word for
  “middle of the month” is Biblical) and theme (an ever-returning moon), is mostly
  observational, seeing the moon as an intriguing, disappearing object in the sky,
  instead of as a metaphor. That simplicity is expressed in the original in the small
  number of words used as well as in the rising and falling sound of the vowels chosen
  (many of them have an <em>ey-ah</em> sound). As previously noted, I tried to mimic
  that minimalist tendency by keeping the lines short, but also by removing much of
  the punctuation. I did capitalize some letters despite the fact that Hebrew does
  not have capitalization to preserve the ebb and flow of the cadence. With regard
  to the rising and falling sounds that reflect the waxing and waning of the moon,
  I tried to transmit the way the poem physically reflects the focus on the moon’s
  physical shape with the shape of the poem (in its rounded lines and curving shape
  as a whole) instead of sound.</p>\n<p>One last note is about the title: I chose
  “Sinking, rising” as opposed to “Waxing, waning” because the latter is too closely
  associated with moon allusions and metaphors. Because the words sinking and rising
  are not usually associated with the moon, they seemed a better fit for describing
  a layperson’s observation of the physical phenomenon.</p> \n"
