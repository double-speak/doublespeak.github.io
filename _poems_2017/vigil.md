  describes the person they are beside.</p>\n"
abio: "<p>Giuseppe Ungaretti (1888–1970) was an Italian poet, critic, and journalist.
  The father of the Hermetic style, Ungaretti wrote poetry characterized by short
  lines, ambiguous syntax, and a lack of punctuation. As evident in this poem, he
  was deeply affected by his time as a soldier in World War I.</p>\n"
