author: Elvira Sastre
translator: Mira Revesz
poem: |-
  <em>Siempre que dormíamos era invierno,
  y en el frío me enseñabas a volar
  y yo te echaba de menos.
  Entonces despertaba.
  Y te echaba
  de menos.</em>


  La primavera no quiere
  que los amores de invierno terminen,

                                pero el verano ha llegado

                                y ha arrasado con todo.

  Ahora tú solo sabes hablar del sol,
  te haces un moño despeinado mientras bostezas,
  te pintas las uñas de los pies,
  te ríes mucho más que antes,
  y, mientras,
  me dejas de querer.

  Ahora yo me vuelvo a refugiar en los poemas
  y escribo sobre febrero,
  echo de menos la lluvia
  y el sabor de tu jersey,

                                                    y, mientras,

                             te quiero más que ayer.
transpoem: "<em>Each time that we were sleeping it was winter,\nand in the cold you
  would teach me how to fly \nand I would miss you.\nThen I’d wake up. \nand keep\nmissing
  you.</em>\n\nSpring doesn’t want\nwintertime loving to end\n\nbut summer has arrived\n\nand
  it’s swept everything away.\n\nNow you only know how to talk about the sun,\nyou
  make a messy bun while you yawn,\nyou paint your toes,\nyou laugh much more than
  before,\nand, meanwhile,\nyou stop loving me.\n\nNow I return to the refuge of poems.
  I seek their shelter \nand write about February,\nI miss the rain\nand the taste
  of your sweatshirt, \n\n                                                                and,
  meanwhile,\n\n                                                I love you more than
  yesterday."
note: "<p>Translating Sastre’s informal, vibrant language in the body of the poem
  was a delight; translating the dream description in the beginning was more difficult.
  The imperfect tense in Spanish evokes a timelessness that the imperfect in English
  doesn’t quite do. In my translation, I strove to preserve the juxtaposition of the
  unbounded time in the italics and the immediacy of the text in standard type.</p>"
abio: "<p>Elvira Sastre, herself a translator, has been praised for bringing renewed
  life to the Spanish language and its poetry. “Hiberno” is from her second book of
  poetry, <em>Baluarte</em>, which was published when she was twenty-two. Among other
  dedications, she dedicates this work “to those who know that poetry is a path of
  thorns that ends in a rose.”</p>\n"
tbio: "<p>Mira Revesz is a senior at Swarthmore College, pursuing a special honors
  major that combines English, education, and religion. After graduation, she will
  teach high school English literature and ESL, and looks forward to reading Lorca
  and Sastre with her students in both Spanish and English.</p>"
