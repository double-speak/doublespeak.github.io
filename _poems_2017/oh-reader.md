  Au Lecteur
  La sottise, l’erreur, le péché, la lésine,
  Occupent nos esprits et travaillent nos corps,
  Et nous alimentons nos aimables remords,
  Comme les mendiants nourrissent leur vermine.
  Nos péchés sont têtus, nos repentirs sont lâches;
  Nous nous faisons payer grassement nos aveux,
  Et nous rentrons gaiement dans le chemin bourbeux,
  Croyant par de vils pleurs laver toutes nos taches.
  Sur l’oreiller du mal c’est Satan Trismégiste
  Qui berce longuement notre esprit enchanté,
  Et le riche métal de notre volonté
  Est tout vaporisé par ce savant chimiste.
  C’est le Diable qui tient les fils qui nous remuent!
  Aux objets répugnants nous trouvons des appas;
  Chaque jour vers l’Enfer nous descendons d’un pas,
  Sans horreur, à travers des ténèbres qui puent.
  Ainsi qu’un débauché pauvre qui baise et mange
  Le sein martyrisé d’une antique catin,
  Nous volons au passage un plaisir clandestin
  Que nous pressons bien fort comme une vieille orange.
  Serré, fourmillant, comme un million d’helminthes,
  Dans nos cerveaux ribote un peuple de Démons,
  Et, quand nous respirons, la Mort dans nos poumons
  Descend, fleuve invisible, avec de sourdes plaintes.
  Si le viol, le poison, le poignard, l’incendie,
  N’ont pas encor brodé de leurs plaisants dessins
  Le canevas banal de nos piteux destins,
  C’est que notre âme, hélas! n’est pas assez hardie.
  Mais parmi les chacals, les panthères, les lices,
  Les singes, les scorpions, les vautours, les serpents,
  Les monstres glapissants, hurlants, grognants, rampants,
  Dans la ménagerie infâme de nos vices,
  II en est un plus laid, plus méchant, plus immonde!
  Quoiqu’il ne pousse ni grands gestes ni grands cris,
  Il ferait volontiers de la terre un débris
  Et dans un bâillement avalerait le monde;
  C’est l’Ennui! L’oeil chargé d’un pleur involontaire,
  II rêve d’échafauds en fumant son houka.
  Tu le connais, lecteur, ce monstre délicat,
  — Hypocrite lecteur, — mon semblable, — mon frère!
transpoem: "Foolishness, error, sin, and greed find homes in our minds as they wear
  down our bodies. And from ourselves we nourish these loveable regrets, like lice
  feed on the beggar’s filthy form. Our sins are stubborn and our confessions false.
  But we pay dearly for them before once again taking the low road, believing that
  vile tears might wash away our stains. \n        On evil’s pillow lounges the pagan
  prophet, cradling our enchanted souls as he turns to steam what was once our icy
  resolve. And the Devil plays puppet master, dangling forbidden fruit in front of
  our noses as we coolly descend, step by step, through foul shadows into Hell. \n
  \       Like that dusty tramp sucking at the martyred breast of an aged harlot,
  we hold tight to a pleasure that has long since run dry. In our brains, demons run
  wild as death tethers itself to our melancholy breath — each one a whisper closer
  to the last. \n        On the threadbare fabric of our destiny we should embroider
  something pleasing: poison, rape, knives, fire! No… we’re too weak for that. But
  among the monkeys, the panthers, the jackals and the scorpions, amid the vultures
  and snakes, and the screeching, slithering, whimpering savages in the zoo of our
  own perversion, one surpasses them all in its depravity. Though subdued in appearance,
  it would gladly crush the world and then consume it whole with a yawn. \n        Yes,
  you, Boredom! A tear sits on your eye, like a glass filled too full, as you dream
  of gallows while a cigarette smolders between your lips. And you, reader, you know
  this fragile monster. Admit it, my hypocrite reader. My reflection… My likeness…
  My brother!"
note: "<p>Whichever requirements for fidelity one has, the above translation does
  not meet them. This is immediately evident from my translation of the title, “Au
  Lecteur” which any good French 110 student would point out means, “To the Reader.”
  Where possible, through both my word choice and prosification of the poem, which
  renders it more letter-like, I highlight the poet’s complicity with the reader.
  The poem, as evidenced by its title, engages whichever reader happens upon it. “Au
  Lecteur” does not exclude the bourgeois reader, the uneducated reader, the unsympathetic
  reader, as certain earlier French writers are wont to do. Baudelaire chooses rather
  to begin in a manner that could be taken as a lament — <em>au lecteur</em> orally
  is the same as <em>Ô lecteur<em> (“Oh, reader”) — creating an immediate sense of
  intimacy and empathy between author and reader that the final stanza will cement.</p>"
abio: "<p>Charles Baudelaire, born in Paris in 1821, was a <em>poète maudit</em>.
  He was a drinker, a revolutionary, a reluctant traveler, a translator, an opium
  addict, and an inspiration to countless poets who came after him, both in France
  and the world over.</p> \n<p>He hoped for his poetry to be one whose beauty would
  transcend whatever theme or content it provided. His prosody is traditional while
  his content is revolutionary. By incorporating vampires and corpses into strict
  meter and rhyme, Baudelaire plays on the tension between attractive form and repulsive
  content. He creates an important bridge from romanticism to modernism, but, like
  many artists, was held in great contempt for the risks he took.</p>\n<p>His most
  famous collection of poems, <em>The Flowers of Evil</em>, was published in June
  1857 and, by August of that year, Baudelaire found himself in a courtroom on charges
  of obscenity. The result was the exclusion of six poems from the work as well as
  a fine.</p>\n<p>He continued to write, publish, and lecture up until a debilitating
  stroke in 1866. He died the following year.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Trask Roberts is a PhD candidate in French studies at Penn. He focuses mainly
  on twentieth-century French fiction and theories of translation.</p>"
