        <h1>about doublespeak</h1>
        <p class="about-p"><em>DoubleSpeak</em> is the University of Pennsylvania’s journal for literary translation. Founded over a decade ago, our annual (print and online) journal celebrates a range of languages and cultures through poetry translated across centuries and around the world. Along with the original on the facing page, each translation is accompanied by a biographical note about the poet--whether less known or internationally beloved--and a substantial translator’s note, in which the contributor reflects on particular challenges of the translation process. As well as interviews with contemporary translators, <em>DoubleSpeak</em> publishes Musings, or personal essays about living with and in translation.</em></p>
