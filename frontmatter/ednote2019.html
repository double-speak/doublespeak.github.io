    <h1>editor’s note</h1>
    <p class="ednote">Dear readers,</p>
    <p class="ednote">Every year, the translations we receive expose me, teach me, and remind me to be more observant, more gentle, more introspective, and more compassionate, and to further engage with my translations and with people. I become enchanted by the stories I read, wondering who the translator is, who the poet is, captured and absorbed by the words in front of me. I relish interactions I have with others, staying curious and aware of the perspectives of those around me. They remind me to stay relatable, to stay humble, and to stay vulnerable.</p>
    <p class="ednote">Nostalgia. Pain. Loneliness. Frustration. Love. Admiration. These are just a few of the emotions that are contained in this year’s magazine in the most raw forms possible. They are naked, but as feelings, they are also approachable. I find translation to be a process in which people can be personal, which I feel is so valuable to us as humans and what truly allows all of us to connect. As translators, we help readers discover themselves and realize their vulnerable feelings in the process. Perhaps those readers are ourselves.</p>
    <p class="ednote">The experience I have with translation is so well-encompassed by the words of the <em>DoubleSpeak</em> staff translation of Amina Saïd’s “j’eus dix ans le ciel en tête,” or “i was ten years old head in the sky:”</p>
    <p class="ednote" style="text-indent:10px">from the second memory of words<br>the most real emotion is born</p>
    <p class="ednote">Translation is universal and deep. We live among languages, we live through languages and we express ourselves through languages. The more languages I discover and the more translations I read, the more I realize we need translation. It provides a sense of belonging, a sense of connection, and sometimes a sense of happiness, hatred, or hope. We are then able to stay human with our raw emotions, and languages help to discover and define our identities through them, guiding us through the unknown.</p>
    <p class="ednote">Even if it’s just for a moment that I can connect with an emotion or with someone, that time spent is invaluable. As my grandfather recently said in a conversation, “<span lang="ko">가까이 하기엔 너무 먼 당신</span>,” or,“I want to keep you close, but you’re too far away.” I feel this way about my relationship with translation, with <em>DoubleSpeak</em>, and all the people I meet. There’s a sense of ephemerality in every aspect of this magazine, but translation still allows me to feel grounded, to feel hopeful. I respect and appreciate others, and build compassion for them, even through a few exchanges of words.</p>
    <p class="ednote">I never would have thought translating Japanese manga and anime would guide me into finding so many people who are passionate about sharing stories through their translations. I am forever grateful for this magazine, for my staff, for our advisors, for translation, for languages, and for you.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>Nadia Park<br>Editor-in-Chief</p>
